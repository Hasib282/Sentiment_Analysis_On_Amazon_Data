"This is one amazing phone. The specs on this phone kicks ass any day. The prices om phones these days are horrible but this one was definitely reasonable Pricing and with it, great specs.Edit: OnePlus releases some shitty updates recently to the os, couple things keep breaking. They also added some dumb features which make things harder to get to. This along with an issue which seems constant amongst OnePlus devices where you can hear others in a call but they can't hear you...

"I am a nerd. I own almost every foldable and phone out there. This foldable is by far the best phone that I have ever had with the exception that it is not dust protected. That is the only reason that I have it accepting Wi-Fi Hotspot from my daily driver S23 Ultra because I do need something that can withstand the elements. Update: Had to factory reset due to constant random resetting during WiFi calls and other tasks. Also found brick dead twice. After reset, no issues, yet. I'll give it a few more days. Update 2: Even after the factory reset, and a few hopeful days using everything else I like about the phone, it started to randomly reboot. This is a deal breaker. Edit Dec 25: I updated the software; crossing fingers that there's no more random reboots. Last edit: 1 star. When only WiFi is on the phone, no data carrier, loss of WiFi signal, causes phone to sporadically reset/restart, no matter what you're doing, even if on a WiFi meeting. Down to 1 star and ""Do Not Buy"" without good warranty status. You'll need the warranty.

"I bought this phone because physically it has features I want but there is also the OS OxygenOS so this is my thoughts on both.I wanted an unlocked phone that works with TracFone. I wanted NFC, minimum of 128gb storage plus the ability to use my micro sd, 5g though 5g was not a deal breaker. As I looked I became aware a 3.5 headphone jack is rarely available on most new phones and I use that daily and it's available on the N30.I had no problems activating the phone and transferring my TracFone service, I used a TracFone sim and the menu available on the TracFone website. The phone functions well everything I was looking for. It does have one physical drawback in my mind and that is the location of the volume keys. The power is on the right and volume on the left and it's easy trying to change the volume to press the power at the same time. In OxygenOS the power button and volume down key activate the power menu to restart or power off and it's easy to press both unintentionally. The battery I'm happy with only charging once a day with the supplied charging block and cable. It will quick charge in about 20 minutes. Overall I am please with the device. The sound is wonderful, the camera good but the interface is different then I previously had. I work from home and use wifi calling without an issue.The OxygenOS is the other part, I have adjusted to most of the differences but it's not what I view as my OS of choice. An example the phone would go to sleep while I was looking at it, I looked for a setting to keep focus while I was looking at the screen but for the life of me I couldn't find an obvious named setting. I continued looking and I have changed so focus stays on but trying so many things I can't tell you which setting changed it. I use Niagra launcher and it makes a change in OS less dramatic. There are two apps I have been unable to uninstall, “Red Cable Club” and the “OneplusClock” I prefer the Google clock I’ve been using for years.I would buy this phone again, it has all the features I was looking for and some of those are being eliminated in new phones.",0.9759,0.17827115694762752,0.24776326678693295,0.09395625442266464,0.4746568202972412,0.35907745361328125,0.4132196431464329,0.3818220642607316,Positive,Positive,Positive,Neutral,Neutral,Negative,Positive,Positive

"Was very worried whether I could get a provider, because I was with Straight Talk with my last phone and I couldn't find information that Straight Talk worked on this OnePlus 11 phone. I went from an A51 Samsung Galaxy phone to the US Factory OnePlus 11.  I took the Sim card out of the Samsung and put it in the OnePlus 11 and I had service right away.I know I couldn't keep the new phone on the old Sim, so I went to get a new Sim Card, but ended up buying a Simple Mobile SIM card which is a sister company to Straight Talk. Had to call into Simple Mobile to set it up though.  It would not just setup. However, when I called customer service and they sent me codes, they asked me questions, such as ""what is your pin"", etc. and I couldn't answer them because I was not setup with Simple Mobile.  I kept saying I am not getting codes from Simple Mobile and I haven't setup security questions with Simple Mobile.  Later during the conversation I noticed I was getting messages from Straight Talk.  I then found out the same people I was speaking with work for both  Straight Talk and Simple Mobile. So, my codes were in another email address I set up for Straight Talk.  The security questions they asked me that I couldn't answer, were actually the Security Questions I setup in Straight Talk.  Was confusing.Want people to know, I just did not want to order a SIM from Amazon or Straight Talk and wait a few days to get it. That is the only reason I didn't set it up with Straight Talk. The IMIE number did work with Straight Talk. I tried it also with Google Fi and Verizon.  Verizon actually recognized the ESIM as well. So, I was surprised. So, my answer to, ""Will this phone work with Straight Talk?"" Yes it will and it also works with Simple Mobile.I bought the Simple Mobile Bring your Own Phone 4G LTE and 5G Sim Card. It was $1.00.  But they charged me another .55 cents for 911 emergency fee for the Sim Card.  When I signed up with Simple Mobile to be my actual provider, I noticed I am charged again .55 cents for 911 emergency fee?The look is different then what is in the pictures.  It is not a dark green.  In fact it is sort of a light blue green.  It is very nice looking and a wonderful surprise. I would say it is more of a marine blue. Laying down with a clear cover on the back of it. It is a light green/gray color.How fast it charges is amazing.  15 to 20 minutes and it is fully charged. Love it!It was very easy to setup.  I used the Google backup method, by backing up my old phone to Google Drive and then uploading from Google Drive to the new phone.  All my apps were setup automatically. I just had to put in my internet credentials and email credentials and I was all set.One thing I noticed was I couldn't shut the phone off. Apparently you press the power button on the right and have to hold the volumn up on the left at the same time to get the power option to shut it off. I didn't like that...so I went into Settings and went to Additional Settings and went to Power Button Menu and then to the Press and hold the power button menu and checked off the Power Menu instead of the Voice Assistant.Now all I have to do is press the right hand button and hold it and I get the Power off menu.  I did this because everytime I went to power down the phone by using the right power button, the Google Voice Assistant popped up.  Couldn't stand it, so I changed that button to just be Power on and off by doing the above.I know I read previous reviews stating this problem, but I don't think anyone said how to change it. So, this is for people like me, who don't want the google assistant coming up when they are trying to shut their phone off.I will try setting it up with my car next, but I really don't expect any problems. The service has been good so far and am not having any problems with text, voice or data.I didn't like the lock screen clock. It was weird as it separated vertically the hour and the minutes.  I was able to change that by going to Settings, then Wallpapers & Style, then menu option: always on Display and then changing the clock.  There are not a lot of options there.  But, maybe I can download something on Google Play.So, far very happy customer.Update:  Works with Android Auto. Set it up in my car with no problem.  Was tricky as I didn't understand what I was doing. Plugged it into my USB port in the car and plugged the other end of cord to the phone.  Went to menu in car and put on BT Pairing and went to my phone and swiped down to get Bluetooth.  It said available devices and gave me some sort of at numbers and letters that had no sense to it one way or another and I pressed that on the phone and then pressed BT pairing on the car menu and I then saw Car Audio and it asked me if I wanted to pair or accept that, so I pressed yes.  Called someone and it came over my car radio which was perfect.  Make sure car is on when you do all of this and it does say to have it in park.  I don't think it mattered in my case.  I have an older 2015 car and it worked fine.  I got calls in and they also went out.  Perfect!  The google mapping worked perfectly on my phone giving me direction by direction.Bought a second US Factory OnePlus 11 5GB for my husband and setup Android Auto and it gives us google mapping on his car dashboard with no problems.",0.9985,0.18591806567416327,-0.5081252455711365,0.3414628207683563,0.49836814403533936,0.2599813938140869,0.025607040827209326,0.20867253633971852,Positive,Positive,Negative,Positive,Neutral,Negative,Neutral,Positive
"This OnePlus 12R is the best phone I have ever owned. I had purchased a Pixel 7 after my iPhone started giving me grief, and the battery was draining quickly. The Pixel 7 had issues, so I purchased an off brand phone, which had to be returned as well as the Moto G Stylus 5G I purchased.I couldn't decide between the OnePlus 12 and the OnePlus 12R, but I went with the 12R since it was more than $200 less. I'm not sorry.This phone charges quickly, the battery is long-lived, and the screen is extremely responsive even with a screen protector. It also takes awesome photos.I highly recommend it to everyone. And it sure beats paying $1500 for a new iPhone.",0.968,0.2610330578512397,0.0246324110776186,-6.104586645960808e-06,0.40200817584991455,0.497143030166626,0.9617534287180715,0.44308255861205675,Positive,Positive,Neutral,Neutral,Negative,Neutral,Positive,Positive
"Disclaimer: I use this phone mainly to talk, text and peruse social media.  I don't do too many live videos or take a ton of photos.This phone does a great job in everything although it's really not a master in anything outside of battery life and charging options.  I get a full day out of this phone easily.  Usually around the 1 day, 3 to 5 hour mark before I charge each day.  I usually charge when the phone gets between 20-25%.  I can leave my house at 35% or even go to bed at 15% and never worry about running out of juice.  And even if I'm low on juice, I can charge this phone from 20-100% in about 25 minutes.  I am amazed at how I can put this phone on the charger and in just a matter of 5 minutes I've gained about 20% of power.  Even when using a USB charger, it's still pretty fast.  Wireless charging is about average.  That is the phone's biggest strength.As far as talking goes, it has a good quality sound.  Coming from a Samsung 20 FE (Verizon service), I found myself missing a call now and then (goes straight to voicemail) or drops in audio when I took calls at home.  I've yet to have a problem with the OnePlus, so I'm guessing the internal anntenna is better because I'm still with Verizon.There are a lot of audio playback options available (Dolby Atmos, Spatial, etc.) and I haven't tried them all out yet, but the speakerphone sounds loud and crisp.  However, when I connect to a Bluetooth speaker or in my car's audio system, the volume tends to be lower.  I have to really crank up the volume in my car or max out my Bluetooth speaker to hear clearly.  However, maybe there's an option I'm missing in the settings that would help me.And there are a ton of options in the settings!  It can be overwhelming to someone who isn't tech-saavy, but it's not as bad as it looks.  Most of the settings are basic on the surface, but if you go into the sub-menus then it will get more advanced.  But you can control things to enhance the already superior battery life to changing your refresh rate for smoother scrolling.  Just about everything else is typical Android stuff, but OnePlus has some nice features of its own with the Floating Window and One-Hand Scrolling.The phone needs a case.  It's not easy to this phone even with both hands.  I wouldn't advise anyone try it unless they have pretty big hands.  It will probably drop as you are texting.  But that's not a deal-breaker because cases are inexpensive.The media on this phone is smooth.  It looks really good and there are options to tweak it even more.  Someone who is an avid TikTok or IG fan will be at home with this phone.  The camera takes amazing photos.  Unfortuantely, I haven't been on vacation yet to give it a real try, but what I've taken so far are very nice.  Definitely a little clearer and more realistic than my Samsung 20 FE.  Recording video is pretty impressive, too, but I've yet to do a live or video call.Anyone who pays almost double for an iPhone or Samsung is really just seeking the brand.  Yes, those phones may have a few more bells and whistles with A.I. and they may have slightly (arguably) better cameras.  But if those phones are a 10 on a scale of 1-10 then the OnePlus is a 9.  And it is much, much more inexpensive to the point that you could probably get two of these for the price of an iPhone or Galaxy 24.",0.9966,0.22757203179334323,0.09275259729474783,0.06967990845441818,0.4642432928085327,0.24003076553344727,0.8346848237692519,0.4442578722623522,Positive,Positive,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Negative,Positive,Positive

"Have had this device since December 2023 (a few weeks after it came out). Below are some pros and cons.CONS:- Camera is mediocre, unless you are taking still photos (which are fantastic)- WiFi speeds are not in the same league of even a prior gen Samsung/Apple flagship devices. I have a S22 Ultra and this, and in the same location, the S22 ultra will show speeds upwards of 870Mbps, whereas in OnePlus Open will not cross 500. Yes, it may not be a deal breaker, but with most homes nowadays having a lot of IoT devices, bandwidth/ speed are all limiters. ALSO: Ensure to turn off ""Private DNS"" which will otherwise cause speeds to be EVEN MORE slower (!!)- Apps sometimes quit and need to be force stop and reopened. May or may not be an Android thing, but seems to happen more on this than my S22 Ultra- Compare the photos from this phone vs the S22 ultra (or S23 or s24) and those are noticeably better/ sharper. All these phones have AI and processing power, so no excuses for the camera being bad. But yes, the software is not up to the mark which could be the difference.PROS:- Screen and display. Size and clarity are fantastic- Still photos from the camera are excellent, with good clarity- Audio quality is really good on both phone / video calls and music, etc- The device is fast (exception of WiFi)MEHs:- Even in places with good towers nearby, the 5G speeds are almost useless (lets' not get started on the whole is 5G worth it discussion)- Phone does get noticeably warmer with using maps for a couple of hours or video playback for couple of hours- Battery life is okay, nothing to write home aboutOVERALL:While it is not a stellar phone for the pricepoint, it is definitely good. And hope it gets better with more OS updates.

"This phone is awesome, only downside though is it doesn’t have more storage options. But it is like the title says “best foldable of 2023” hands down. Wider outside display, excellent cams and it even has stylus support not only on the inside screen but outside, too. You can use a cheap stylus from amazon, if you don’t mind not having all the features. Or you can basically wait for one plus to get their stylus on the market(amazon).

"I like that this phone has a good battery life and charges superfast. The display is crisp and clear -- again something I like. The speakers allow me to listen to a lecture while driving if put on my shoulder. The one thing I dislike, and it is probably a part of the OS, is that I cannot delete portions of a message thread; the only option is to delete the entire thread. Also, I am used to a quick and easy way to add contact info to an incoming text. I go round and round trying to figure out how to do this with this OS. This is definitely an improvement to my Samsung and Motorola phones. No real bloatware. The automated ""clean app"" bing from T Mobile did not work despite multiple bings. That's OK just as long as I can do it manually. This is my second Nord OnePlus phone. It won't be my last.

"For context, I've been a long-time iPhone user, and I've been taking flack for it ever since I started working in tech. After doing research on the best folding phone I landed on this one.I think its a brilliant phone when it comes to the camera, screen and software features. Oxygen OS is amazing and I hate to admit it, but far superior to iOS in my humble opinion.That being said, customer support for this device is non-existent. My mother-in-law accidentally dropped my phone, and even though it was in a pretty rugged case, the internal screen got damaged. It's been over a month since I started the repair process with One Plus directly, and they told me today that they haven't even inspected it. On top of that, I called several phone repair shops here in Southern California, and they estimate they might have repair parts in a year.Which ultimately leads me to this:The fact that getting a device repaired is such a pain makes it completely impractical.

"Update:I no longer close myself out of apps (except just now, bc this phone has a twisted sense of humor). Like any new setup, it just took a little getting used to. For example, I added a screen protector, not realizing it came with one already on it. I don't expect to upgrade for quite a while, but when I do, I probably won't even bother looking at other brands. OnePlus is the way to go - the Nord n30 feels and acts like a much more expensive device than it is.Original:I had never heard of the OnePlus brand until recently, but they seem to have a very good reputation. The Nord n30 kept topping the list of best lower-cost phones, so I took a chance and I'm so glad. My old phone was glitching a lot, basically acting like it was on the verge of total failure. I wanted to get something of reasonable quality, and fortunately, Amazon lets you pay in installments with no interest. That makes a big difference when money is tight, and at the holidays in particular.It's thin and light, and the screen is about as big as it can get without being ridiculous. That's perfect if you're 40+ and don't see as well anymore. The downside is that if you happen to have small hands, it may take some getting used to - it's just the slightest bit of a reach. The display is bright and beautiful, and it's super quick with no lagging. If you watch videos or listen to music you'll notice that the sound quality is amazing, particularly with earphones.I take a lot of photos, so the camera was important too. This one is very nice and I've gotten some excellent pics of the cat (and really, what else are cameras for?). I tested it on notoriously difficult holiday lights at night, and it did very well. Looking forward to landscapes and snow scenes. And more cat. The only thing that bugs me is I keep accidentally minimizing apps by swiping too close to the bottom where the functions are. That's something you have to acclimate to, but hopefully I'll get there soon.Overall this is an excellent choice if you want a high quality phone that doesn't cost half a month's rent.",0.9974,0.22171330653473514,0.24168415367603302,0.06532982364296913,0.4677889347076416,0.35657012462615967,0.9018017738162298,0.48558581153399344,Positive,Positive,Positive,Neutral,Neutral,Negative,Positive,Positive
I recently bought this phone with the intention to use it. It exceeded my expectations and arrived with the box SEALED and with a SCREEN PROTECTOR APPLIED! this phone came in and only took about 15 minutes to set up and it is really nice quality and feel to it. I thought i might have been scammed but NO! perfect phone in perfect condition with the only real flaw being how weird the screen protector feels when i touch it but I will get used to it. Phone starts with a base 8 gb of ram and has expandable ram (if you have extra storage space it can be used up to 6 gb of ram) the user interface is fine and uses google messages and provides a lot of versatility with its settings. the phone is currently a 5/5 for me!,0.9346,0.04722222222222222,0.04502763971686363,0.001944635296240449,0.503955602645874,0.43372583389282227,0.9396471263339735,0.39368832471385995,Positive,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Negative,Positive,Positive
"I bought this phone at the recommendation of a friend who is very happy with theirs. I'm someone who isn't picky about my technology... I just want it to be straightforward, reliable and affordable. I'd honestly just get a flip phone if it wasn't so hard to get by in today's day & age without it being the expectation now that everyone has a smart device, on them at all times.Well... this phone fits the bill and then some! First of all, the battery life is honestly baffling. I'm not joking, I drove 20 minutes with GMaps GPS running and arrived still at 100%. I was so confused, not a single percentage point? I just wanted something that didn't obnoxiously guzzle battery and got so much more! Not sure how long this level of performance will last with the limited knowledge I have on how to maintain it, but sufficed to say this is really amazing so far.As far as everything else goes, I upgrade my phone so infrequently that I really don't know how it compares to what else is out there... even if you showed me ""the specs."" I'm sure it isn't the absolute best around, but what I can tell you is this: the call clarity is great, both handheld and speaker. Bluetooth connects quickly and stays connected. I can have a lot of apps and Internet tabs open and switch between them and not be waiting for stuff to load (don't worry, I clear them when I'm done). Oh and the camera quality is so clear! Long story short, everything that needs to work works, it works well, and it's pretty easy for a less tech savvy person like myself to figure out.The price point is what initially sold me. I paid only $250 for this phone and I feel like it was an excellent value. Most other devices I've seen online average nearly twice that cost, or are a similar/lower price but poor quality.

"I'm happy to get away from the Samsung craziness.

"This is a smartphone for less than $300 and you get exactly what you pay for. Some pros: the battery is amazing. It will last all day on heavy use. The processor is quick enough for email, web browsing, video and music use, and some basic games.Cons: the screen is very finicky. Often tapping a back button will somehow result in a double-tap. Scrolling down a page doesn't feel like a smooth glide but more clunky. The cellular reception on phone calls is quite poor. When indoors and on a call, often times you will be able to hear a caller but they are unable to hear you. The camera is also about mid-range quality.All in all, if you're not trying to spend $1000+ on a phone, this will fulfill your needs. If you need something with better quality and performance, the Nord series isn't for you. Please take this 3-star review as a badge of honor.

"May/2024Coming from Apple and Samsung I thought I will regret the decision to get this Cellular phone. I was wrong and I will never go back. This is the best phone you can have and you can save some money too. Everything is outstanding on it, Battery life for 2 or more days, then I can connect it to the charger for 20 mins and that's it, I don't have to worry anymore for Battery or charging times, nothing, a tremendous relieve for sure. I consider everything else better than previous phones and a better value than iPhone 14 pro max and Samsung S23 Ultra (My previous) so I can recommend it to anyone without any hesitation.07/13/2024Downgraded to 3 stars cause of Oneplus updates.I used to love my OP12, but after the last update ( June-July/2024) this phone is a mess, extremely buggy, Gmail is frozen every 2 or 3 times I open it, I cannot hang up calls, sometimes the call does not go thru in or out, I have missed several calls from my work team and relatives as well, some apps are not working or stopped working in the middle of something. I had to buy an iPhone 15 in a rush to avoid communication issues both at home and work (Since I'm working remotely). It's been a very bad and sad 2-3 weeks till I decided to switch for good, I cannot wait for a month to the next update to see if everything has been fixed. This is an amazing phone and I loved it, also I have the Oneplus watch 2 and this is a killer combination, I did forget about chargers and charging time with this two and it is a shame that this is happening to this flagship. I think Oneplus must take note on this and never have the same mistake again, this is not a cheaper device either. Disappointed.BTW I was using it on Google Fi (eSim) without issues till the last update.Also, solutions: In crashed apps you have to close and reopen them, most of the time they are working again. No need to clear cache or anything else, at least I do not have to.For calls: Worked for me to change the audio to Speakers during the call and then hang up, be aware that sometimes when you do it the phone app hang up by itself (It is randomly). I never tried the airplane mode, but some people say that is working too for this.For missing calls, I did not find a solution, Google Fi customer service did not know what was causing it.",-0.851,0.12911764705882356,0.030416972935199738,-0.059466615319252014,0.3572317361831665,0.3011186122894287,-0.21283856402150542,-0.19275411186934682,Negative,Positive,Neutral,Neutral,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative

"Have been a LG user since their first Android phone. Since LG is out of the phone market now I had to find a different phone to replace my Velvet 5G. After looking at options for almost 2 months I heard about the OnePlus 12. Got it on the monthly no interest plan with intent to keep it if I liked it or send it back if I didn't. To be honest this phone is pretty much perfect. 16GB of RAM + the phone's ability to use extra storage as temporary RAM is almost obscenely fast for a mobile device. 512GB of on board storage will hold pretty much anything I could need for the foreseeable future. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 tears through games like a hot knife in butter, and the phone automatically adjusts settings for best experience. Now that brings me to the final piece of this pie: the battery. This sucker is massive, and paired with the included power brick and charger cable it routinely charges from under 15% to 100% in 20 minutes. I have spent 12 hours using it non-stop and barely dropped past 40%.This may come off like an advertisement but I simply cannot overstate how much I enjoy this phone. If I had any complaint it would probably be the curved screen.

"There is nothing I dislike about this phone. One of the things that blows my mind is how fast you can fully charge the battery, put the battery in smart charge mode, expand the RAM memory without the need to buy a RAM memory card, and the built-in speakers. Apparently somebody was thinking outside of the box when this phone was in development. They understood the critical importance of battery life and performance along with RAM memory. For instance I expanded my RAM memory from 16 gigabytes of RAM to 24 gigabytes of RAM by simply sliding the slider switch in the settings and what a huge difference it made. No freezing up of any apps, quick responses when launching an app or apps etc.Although this phone does not have a memory card slot such as an SD card slot for external storage it more than makes up for that and you can get around that easily: You can share your files or photos very easily by 1. Transfer them using Bluetooth from or to your computer or another phone. 2. Tether to your computer or utilize NFC. This phone has two SIM card slots meaning if you want to add another number for business use you can do that without having to buy an extra phone - what a real convenience and money saver.This phone is very intuitive and informative on many levels. The weight and feel is very nice and the appearance. There are a lot of hidden features and tricks within this phone. When the phone's battery is in smart charging mode and I highly recommend that the phone will record your charging habits thereby increasing the battery life based on your charging habits. In case you're wondering it only takes half an hour to fully charge the phone. I end by repeating my words are not adequate enough on how awesome this phone is for the price. Is it worth the price?

"***OnePlus is throttling performance in the most used apps***I've been a OP user for several years. I was waiting for the OP9 model new cameras, as this has been traditionally the ""compromise"" on previous models.I've read about the battery & heat issues reported by several users at product launch. But it seems that was  already addressed by recent updates. So I decide to buy it.Unfortunately OP has resorted to throttling apps to tackle these battery/heat issues. IMO, this is just not acceptable. Pls google ""OnePlus throttling"" and you'll find a tons of reports of this.According to the news, this throttling affects not just Chrome, but all the apps that I use for work. I couldn't believe it. So I run a test against OP5T. The results are staggering. The OP9 is way more sluggish than a 4 years old model. See the attached pictures with the benchmark results.So if you buy for the performance of the Snapdragon 888, you'll not get it (as of time of this review). If you can live with that, you'll getting a great screen and good camera package.

"I wasn't sure about the N30, but now I am. Great device! I've had a variety of not so great androids, with some good ones like the galaxy S2, and pixel 3. This N30 replaces my OnePlus 9 5G that's just about 3 years old and the battery wears out quickly. 3 or 4 years is normally my upgrade window. To the phone: The N30's processing ability (695 Snapdragon) is on par or better than the 9's (888 Octocore), frame refresh rate is very good, pictures look good and the speakers also work very well. Games and videos stream smoothly, and how about the external memory capability? Not many devices support that feature anymore. I've had the phone for 3 days now and recharge only once a day, takes 30-40 or so minutes. The bottom line though is this phone performs really well. I added a nice protective case with a 256 GB micro SD card and I'm at a mere $310 including tax. My 9 5G was $700 alone. Absolutely awesome value at this price point.

Edit.. you can, after the latest update.3. The panorama mode has been improved and is much smoother. However it doesn't take advantage of the wider camera. You can't choose the camera/lens either. If you install GCam, it will give you a wider(or higher)more pixels.4. In pro mode if you adjust certain parameters and leave the rest floating, the shutter speed won't go down below a limit to compensate(unless you adjust that also manually.5. You can't zoom in in portrait mode. Why?6. The stabilization rocks(but the video is cropped compared to the photos).Lost the ability to set dark mode for individual apps with the last update.Also the Bluetooth randomly connects and disconnects if there is nothing playing.",0.8176,0.06307760141093473,0.16827942430973053,0.22109995782375336,0.4089317321777344,0.36886000633239746,0.5650217873195821,0.3670157541728002,Positive,Neutral,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Positive,Positive

"Phone is OnePlus first attempt at a folding phone, and it is a decent first attempt, but not at the full price of the unit. With incentives with trade-in (OnePlus 8 Pro) and repeat buyer, I got this phone for $350 less than retail. Still a bit steep for its design.I will get right to the point with my issues and hope that updates will address the issues:Apps do not realize that the phone is a folder. I play games, I run programs. Switching from full screen to front screen or vice versa the Apps do NOT RESIZE correctly. It just skews big to small or stretches from small to big. App must be restarted to correctly fit the screen.Game apps do not position correctly. I had a Fold it always sized the view area and positioned the app in a useable manner. This phone does NOT support full screen apps correctly...it is what I called center skewed.Screen brightness algorithm is very arbitrary. Screen gets bright if you turn it up manually. Outside in the bright sun it is visible when you MANUALLY turn up screen brightness. It does NOT automatically set screen brightness even when it is enabled, annoying. In a dark warehouse, on odd occasions the screen turns on with setting at 1/3 brightness...it is way too bright for my inside needs.Battery life is very good, fast charging via cable only is not an issue for me.  I do not need wireless charging.Screen has poor color saturation.  Colors are dark and muted, not bright at all like the older OnePlus 8 Pro.So far, I am tolerating the phone. I would give it a 3.5...but you cannot give it half numbers, so I am rounding up.",0.9794,0.09029185867895546,0.4285845458507538,0.2767704501748085,0.3777209520339966,0.2780020236968994,0.013479626759853536,0.3577052962928743,Positive,Neutral,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Neutral,Positive
"Buy it. This is an amazing device and a home run from OnePlus. As a buyer since the OnePlus 6 and follower of Carl Pei, the previous CEO, I've bought every OnePlus device since and always ""Settled"" for the OnePlus 7T McLaren. It has a Pop Out Selfie Camera, 90hz, 12gb RAM, Fast Charging, Great Screen, and the photos rivaled my wife's current S22u in some cases! It was so good, that every phone since the 7T McLaren just couldn't reach the bar that phone set. Now here's the 12. And this is the one. This is the keeper, and will be my next daily driver for hopefully the same amount of time as my 7 series! Camera in this phone is absolutely brilliant. The screen is bright-Very Bright- and smooth as butta. Colors are vibrant, sound is clear, and very easy on the eyes. Battery?!? Did someone say battery? This thing is a beast! I'm really enjoying this so far and happy I made the purchase. OnePlus has outdone itself here, and I will be pairing it to the OnePlus Watch 2 and OnePlus Buds 3 very soon!

Had several budget or so called mid range phones. Ive had the best luck with motos. But wanted something different and wanted the bug screen. Decided to take a chance. Ive been blow away. Battery insane. Fast charging boom!  Speakers are super loud. So far anything I've thrown it this phone it's handled with ease.  It worth noting the 108mp camera was not on by default. Turned that on and honestly it take pretty good pictures. Videos are good too. 5g on this thing Flys like s space shuttle. Running it cricket net work (att) zero issues.  Very very impressed with this phone.  The 120 refresh scolling is lag free. And I'm digging the oxygen os system. It's a nice spin on andriod.  Would definitely recommend this. It's a Big screen almost 6.8  with a knock off otter box case it 6.9 all day long.

"I wanted to love this phone.  Really, I did.  But, I don't.  The screen size is good both when closed (like a regular phone) and when open (like a small tablet).  But, the operating software itself is, to put it nicely, very buggy and I personally find the larger screen of limited use.  There just isn't enough software optimized for it to make it valuable.  That said, the stuff that is designed for it is really quite nice.Unfortunately, the camera ""bump"" is more like a mountain and is extremely obtrusive.  Like, really, really huge.  And what in the absolute **** is up with a phone in 2024 that does not have wireless charging built in???  Yes, the high-speed wired charging is great.  But not being able to simply top-up with your car's wireless charger or missing the convenience of just dropping it on a Qi charger when going to bed is absurd.  Absolutely no excuse for omitting it.Overall, a cool idea but not ready for prime time in my opinion.

"The quick charge is awesome, especially considering that it's a 4,500 millith amp hour battery! Fastest change I've ever seen..... I've got TMobile, and the 5G speed is good. Not as quick as I was expecting, like not jaw-dropping, but really good, and it's more consistent than 4G LTE. Easy to transfer data from my Google pixel to the 9 5G. Sensitivity of the phone is good, haven't taken too many pictures, but I took a few from outside that look nice. Surprised that even with multiple apps open, watching stocks on Webull and Robinhood, the phone doesn't get hot. That's indoor use though, if I was using it outside in the heat that might change. Altogether though, this phone's a definite recommend from me.

Purchased this as a gift for my techie 17yr old. He really enjoys the features of this phone. It's great for school. It's pen capable and you can find the Oppo pen online (OP hasn't offered one to date). A nice hack for note taking. There's been some glitches here and there that should be worked out with updates.

"Bought the phone because of OnePlus reputation for phones with almost native Android, the warp charger and wireless charging. But it did not charge wirelessly despite the claim on the Amazon listing It's confusing since OnePlus makes this phone with and without wireless charging depending on the market and the US is one with wireless charging.The model with wireless charging is LE2115 which is displayed when you go into the phone settings. But the stickers on the outside said LE2110 which the model without wireless charging. It's almost like somebody flashed the LE2115 ROM on a LE2110 phone except the phone came in what looked like genuine OnePlus retail packing with stickers, screen protector and case.Because the phone charges so quickly and not sure if another would be the same decided to keep the phone but Amazon gave me a $120 credit for the incorrect information on the listing.",0.7284,0.030555555555555558,0.514998197555542,-0.3702995181083679,0.3746607303619385,0.13808202743530273,-0.12544598457799833,0.1556416500849463,Positive,Neutral,Positive,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Positive

"I was vacillating between purchasing a used Samsung or Google phone but came upon this OnePlus Nord N30 5G. I purchased 4 month old phone on a Amazon special for $237.00 and am absolutely thrilled with it! The price point for used phones all came with refurbished batteries and the reviews came mixed. The 5000mh on the OnePlus is one of the highlights of the phone. I do not game on my phone or use it for photos/video's. The photo's are okay, but the video is only 1080p. However, if you want the android experience with a cheap price, you cannot go wrong. The OxygenOS is close to vanilla and you are able to either uninstall or disable any of the OnePlus apps which is a huge plus.Another nice feature is the fingerprint sensor, it is quite responsive and located on the side of the phone, which is much more convenient than under the screen. It makes you realize how expensive it is for all the bells and whistles that come with the major players like Samsung and Android. The only thing I don't like is just one update eligibly for the Android OS. But, for $237, I'll look past it. I connected a Samsung Galaxy watch so I can enjoy the Samsung Pay without the Samsung pricey phone.

Later found some fine scratches on the screen and initiate a return. Was pass around four times before getting a rep telling me to return for refund.
