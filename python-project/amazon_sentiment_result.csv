"If you are already using Samsung products, you'll probably love this phone. If not, good luck!Samsung tries to make you convert your basic apps to theirs (calendar, photo gallery, etc) and you can't uninstall their apps.The fingerprint sensor is on the side of the phone and is a button. So you have to push hard enough to detect your fingerprint, but not too hard or else you've pressed the on/off button. Half the time it doesn't even recognize my fingerprint and I have to reposition.The face recognition works a fraction of the time.The screen will not turn on (even just to show you the time) unless you press the on/off button.There's about a 1 second delay when taking pictures. Which doesn't sound like a whole lot, and wouldn't be if you're just shooting inanimate objects, but I have 4 kids that I'm trying to get pictures of. They can move a lot in one second! Also, it takes another second or two or three between pictures if you're trying to take multiple in a row. The camera may have a ton of MP, but it lags bad and the pictures really aren't that great. Also, if your location isn't turned on, it will prompt you to turn it on every single time you open your camera.I'm returning this because it's just not user friendly.",-0.9696,0.02517857142857144,0.11295019660769867,0.026695632864968122,0.0,9.525136e-07,1,0.02788933620211601,1,Negative,Positive,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,59,40

"CORRECTION !!!  I purchased a Samsung Galaxy S21+ from CELL UNIVERSAL in early OCTOBER (not November). When it arrived it didn't work properly - UNLESS you consider a screen that was backwards !!  It appears not from left to right as phones do, but from RIGHT to Left. This makes things such as swiping left now require swiping right. And instead of moving the slider left to right to increase brightness, or  to increase or decrease the volume, these are backwards as well. I contacted the company CELL UNIVERSAL but got no response. When I contacted Amazon they tried to help, but all I got from CELL UNIVERSAL was questions, and no way to get a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA). After more contacts with Amazon, CELL UNIVERSAL finally sent me an address to send it back, but no RMA. Apparently they are expecting ME to pay to send it back. Overall, This company, CELL UNIVERSAL, APPEARS to be making me jump through numerous hoops without doing anything to resolve this issue. It's almost, to me, like they are trying to get me so tired of playing this game that I just give up and let them ""steal"" my $879.27 !!!  Amazon itself has been very good at trying to help with this, so it's not Amazon I'm angry at - it's strictly Cell Universal.

I originally got this phone in June and I wanted to use it or over a month to generate honest opinions. First off Alexa is not pre-installed you have to manually install it. Secondly the Amazon OnePlus 8 does not come with a clear case included in the box. Now that I got those out of the way this phone is amazing it's really fast has an amazing screen though some people say they have green tint issues I have not experienced that on my unit. The software or oxygen OS is very fast and very reminiscent of stock Android though there are some pre-installed apps such as Netflix and Facebook installer but you are able to uninstall Facebook. The screen is beautiful and pretty big and that 90 Hz makes a huge difference from 60 Hz. I showed this to my friends and family and they were blown away with how fast it was. The camera on this phone gets a bad rap from people for some unknown reason because I've used this and it's the best camera of ever used on a phone apart from the 2mp macro camera that is only useful for gimmicky purposes. I actually had a better experience with the main camera zoomed in two times than the macro camera. Battery life on this phone with my usage is amazing I watch a lot of YouTube and scroll through social media every once in awhile and play simple games and I get a day and a half to two days of battery life. Even if the battery life wasn't amazing the warp charge 30t charges my phone from 0% to 70% in 30 minutes. The downsides of this phone are losing out on some flagship creature comforts such as wireless charging an official IP rating and a telephoto camera. Honestly this phone in a $699 package is a great value it includes all of the flagship features you need and cuts the stuff you don't. I bragged about this phone constantly and convinced my family members to switch from their iPhones to this phone.,0.9942,0.21671171171171175,0.01091052526646763,0.03186165326628518,1.0,7.5973617e-07,1,0.46481209285437597,1,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,Positive,Neutral,93,50
"At first I thought it did not work. I was using with Mint Mobile and when I installed my SIM, it didn't work. If you're going to use Mint, here's a tip. When they send you a SIM card, they send 2 cards! The one you ordered, and another, for a friend!?! But I wasn't expecting 2 SIM cards and had no idea there were 2 in the box, so I just opened the box and installed the first card I found, not thinking there was another one. Turns out I installed the extra card which they give you to give a friend LOL? Kinda strange, right! Once we figured out that was the issue, it was smooth sailing. I installed the other SIM that was there, unbeknownst to me, and it worked like a charm. I also tested it briefly with TMobile, and it worked without any problem. So the phone is unlocked and I can vouch that it works on those networks. Pro tip: If you need Mint support, it's better to get phone support if you can, because chat support was definitely much less informed of how to troubleshoot my issue, and I almost thought I'd need to return the phone. Also, make sure you really want this phone before purchasing it! Because Amazon return policy forces you to do a UPS pickup on returns, if you choose to return. So you have to wait around all day for UPS to come to your door to return the phone, and it sounds like it can be a real drag. They'll also take their sweet time returning the funds to your bank. So, thankfully, I am keeping this one, and so far, I'm liking it. It's VERY zippy! Also, very slippery! Get a case, as it will fall from your hands constantly!

"I got my S9 after my S4 crapped out after 5 years (screen went off, wasn't even cracked).  My S4 & S9 served me very well!  I had the S9 for 4+ years it simply is an amazing phone.  I was at a crowded place, and someone knocked my elbow while holding it.  It fell, and the screen cracked pretty bad (not like one crack, many cracks).  Screen still works perfectly, but, I was scared it could stop working at any time.  So, I needed a new phone.  I looked at the S21 FE and S22.  At the time I purchased, the prices were about $200 different (then a week after I purchased, prices were the same!).  But, I'm happy with my purchase.  I liked small phones in the past, never had a bigger one.  I am actually enjoying the larger screen.  Better for viewing content.  I'm a guy and my pants pockets are plenty large for this phone as well.  Feels no different than my previous S9 in my pocket.  I've watched a lot of YouTube reviews of the camera / video quality / test pics and footage, and it seems they are almost the same (sometimes I prefer and think the S21 FE image / video looks better, others the S22 looks better - kind of a toss up).So, what have I noticed?  Well, battery life is amazing!  Beats my S9 by FAR!  Now, my S9 was 4+ years old when I had to replace it (now use the S9 as a ""camera I'm not worried about losing or breaking"").  I had the S9 for a long time, and I cannot remember how good battery life was when I first got it.  But, I don't recall it ever getting worse either.  What I can say is, I used to have to top my S9 up a bit at least once or twice a day.  My S21 FE, lasts ALL DAY (and I even have the battery saver setup so it only charges to 85% - never did that with the S9).  And even from 85%, I get a full day no problem!  Usually around 35% or so when I am ready for bed.  The screen is great.  I do leave on 120hz mode all the time.  I also have dark mode turned on.  I like how it looks, and dark things on screen use less battery than bright white things.  But yes, battery is great.Now the cameras.  My S9 actually had almost identical video.  I make YouTube videos and the S9 did me very well in 4K by 30 or 60.  I do notice the S21 FE is ever so slightly better image.  It also has better stabilization and just some other processing stuff that helps out.  The pictures are better for sure.  I've taken pictures of people and shown them, and they've been like, ""What phone is that?!?  The pictures are sooooo good!""  The S9 did well.  But, the S21 FE is for sure an improvement.  I used to use my G7X Mark ii for most pictures, because it just was better by far than my S9.  Now, I don't think I ever really need that camera anymore.  This phone produces awesome photos!I haven't had a single issues, no glitches, no nothing.  Just a smooth perfectly working phone.  I did kind of like the S9 having the fingerprint reader on the back.  But, I quickly got used to the in screen reader.  It works fast and great.  Apps load fast.  Camera is on in an instant with a double tap of the power button.  Just really nothing to complain about.  I would have kept my S9 another few years, but, I am happy with the S21 FE and hope it lasts me 5+ years as well.Great phone, if you are looking into it and deciding if you want to get it, I for sure recommend it.",0.9991,0.26828778860028857,0.09395557481228778,0.07359504571407438,1.0,0.93717027,1,0.6245869537473933,1,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,182,116

I bought the one plus 9 pro and returned it because it had terrible signal and terrible Bluetooth. This 10 pro has zero issues for me.

"I love the phone. It is so much nicer than my older Note 4.  It has Facial Recognition, as well as a Fingerprint Reader. This Fingerprint reader is now part of the on/off button on the side of the phone. You only need to position your index finger on it as you hold the phone in your hand... no more swiping your finger!  In addition to the up and down volume toggle buttons on the right edge of the phone, there is a power button which is also the finger print reader. There are two additional buttons, one of the left edge and one on the top edge, both of which can be assigned to an app or a event.  The LED light used for notification has been moved from the top front of the phone to the top edge of the phone, so you can't always see the LED flashing unless you're looking at the top edge of the phone.The phone is thin and actually longer than my Note 4. In addition, the screen is larger and resolution is higher especially since the the display is the entire front, as there is no loner a bezel. Even the front facing camera is inside the screen display, which is strange when looking at a picture since you may think that there is a black dot in the top right of the picture, when actually it is the front facing camera.Since the phone is not sold by Verizon, I had some issues getting it provisioned.  Some of the Verizon employees said it wasn't supported, when in fact it is. The phone has two SIM card slots. When I entered the 1st IMEI number (slot 1) on the Verizon site, it said that this phone is a perfect match. I eventually got it provisioned by swapping the SIM card between my Note 4 and XCover Pro phones.  The only remaining issue is that voice mail doesn't work when the SIM in in the XCover Pro.  I have to believe that that will eventually get fixed. (I am on hold with Verizon as I type this).The documentation is almost useless. A simple pamphlet is provided with a basic diagram, but it is not clearly evident that slot 1 actually has a lower slot for a Verizon nano SIM card, and an upper slot, for the SD card.  There is of course a second SIM card slot to the right of first for a GSM SIM card. You need to remove the large battery to access any of the slots (which is simple).  Also the first SIM card slot has a very tiny embedded lever that allows you to easily remove the nano SIM card! I didn't look to see if the second SIM card slot has a similar lever.",0.7954,0.12545544733044733,0.00025459150045761825,0.0005482506092959889,1.0,2.244386e-06,1,0.4173800762608853,0,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,Positive,Negative,137,71

"Update:I no longer close myself out of apps (except just now, bc this phone has a twisted sense of humor). Like any new setup, it just took a little getting used to. For example, I added a screen protector, not realizing it came with one already on it. I don't expect to upgrade for quite a while, but when I do, I probably won't even bother looking at other brands. OnePlus is the way to go - the Nord n30 feels and acts like a much more expensive device than it is.Original:I had never heard of the OnePlus brand until recently, but they seem to have a very good reputation. The Nord n30 kept topping the list of best lower-cost phones, so I took a chance and I'm so glad. My old phone was glitching a lot, basically acting like it was on the verge of total failure. I wanted to get something of reasonable quality, and fortunately, Amazon lets you pay in installments with no interest. That makes a big difference when money is tight, and at the holidays in particular.It's thin and light, and the screen is about as big as it can get without being ridiculous. That's perfect if you're 40+ and don't see as well anymore. The downside is that if you happen to have small hands, it may take some getting used to - it's just the slightest bit of a reach. The display is bright and beautiful, and it's super quick with no lagging. If you watch videos or listen to music you'll notice that the sound quality is amazing, particularly with earphones.I take a lot of photos, so the camera was important too. This one is very nice and I've gotten some excellent pics of the cat (and really, what else are cameras for?). I tested it on notoriously difficult holiday lights at night, and it did very well. Looking forward to landscapes and snow scenes. And more cat. The only thing that bugs me is I keep accidentally minimizing apps by swiping too close to the bottom where the functions are. That's something you have to acclimate to, but hopefully I'll get there soon.Overall this is an excellent choice if you want a high quality phone that doesn't cost half a month's rent.",0.9974,0.22171330653473514,0.11908639234820484,0.04724670130684827,1.0,0.7796428,1,0.5950127457925806,1,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,96,71

"The modified custom Android OS can be problematic at time. It's glitchy, fussy, and appears to be unstable in my opinion. Things on it get copied and pasted out of nowhere without your intervention. The screen is sometimes unresponsive or gets very jumpy. The finger sensor on the front is so dumb and leaves excessive prints on your screen. If you buy a screen protector, the fingerprint sensor will struggle to read your fingerprint. This phone is slower than expected because of the burned in bloatware. I am not seeing the speed as a Snapdragon Gen 2 should be, and that is because of the bloatware. One of my older phones seem about the same speed as this one. This phone isn't fast. The selection of mobile carriers will disappoint you. I could not get Verizon and the many Verizon sub-carriers to work with it. But AT&T and T-Mobile and their sub-carriers are a go.

"First off, I'm not a power user, so I can't speak to processor speed, ability to game, or any of that. 3/4 or more of the time I use it as strictly a phone, I don't even have data or WiFi turned on because I don't need it. This replaced a Moto Stylus that was losing battery capacity and was old enough to not warrant replacing the battery, which isn't easy anymore.Battery life is better than the Stylus when it was new, and that's saying something.  If I'm just around the house, not using mobile data or WiFi, in a couple of days the battery may drop to 80% or so...which is pretty good because I'm in an area with lousy cell coverage, with the phone varying between towers in two different time zones. That's a battery eater, but this phone handles it well. It also seems to connect easier and with a better signal than the Stylus in the same areas. Granted the Stylus is 4g and this is 5g, but at my house there are no 5g signals, so everything here is 4g LTE.Camera? Again I'm not a professional photographer, but the camera seems to be every bit as good as the one on the Stylus, which people rate highly. The pictures I've taken have come out well and I'm happy with the camera.I rate the audio quality, of both the handset and external speaker on phone calls as better than the Stylus. The media audio has a 200% setting that is way overdrive in volume, I have some hearing loss and it's way too loud for me.Changeover was easier than I've ever had. Most of my apps transferred with their settings and passwords, and yesterday when I went to set up Bluetooth for my cheap radio in my old truck, I was shocked to find that somehow it had set up itself.... I had phone functions and BT Audio (aka Sirius) without having to pair and enter numbers. The phone also pops up to tell me about apps running in the background that are wasting battery, and gives the option to optimize them for battery life which is great.All told, I don't have many complaints. The method to power off is not instinctive, but it does prevent accidental turn offs.All in all, if you're a normal person looking for a phone first and internet toy second, I think you'll be happy.",0.9858,0.22265656565656566,0.1514463080616677,0.11715670909737774,0.0,3.9199244e-06,1,0.3538662146771499,1,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,108,74

"I was looking for a phone with 5G support, and I was looking for something affordable with a large screen, good camera performance, and built-in stereo speakers, and I found this phone. this was my first OnePlus and I was quite worried, but I was right. I am so glad I came across this one. The battery charger comes with an adapter since it is European spec, but the 65w warp charger charges surprisingly fast. Shooting in night mode is very bright, and shooting video in 4K with the built-in hand stabilizer makes it look like a pro. It didn't come with a music playback app, but I installed the free Pulsar from the google play store. I recommend this app for gapless playback, and it plays Pink Floyd and early Queen albums without boundaries just like records.

"This was an amazing purchase for me. But I do have to preface this review by saying that I am updating from  an LG G4 that I got for free from Verizon in 2016, so this is a complete upgrade for me from a practically useless phone versus people moving from a more recent model.This phone is HUGE. I am somewhat regretting not paying closer attention to the dimensions and opting for one of the lesser s23 models, but I know I‚Äôll get used to it after a month or so. New phones are always an adjustment.I was able to set up my phone through Verizon but was unable to do it with the eSIM and had to head to a store to get a physical sim. So be aware if you plan on taking advantage of the eSIM. It might not be as easy as they make it seem.I do NOT use facial recognition or fingerprint scan so I can‚Äôt speak to those.The display is beautiful and covers the entire surface of the phone vs. others that have black bands on top and bottom.I‚Äôm not a huge app user so I have minimal screen time but the last time I charged my phone was 72 hours ago and I am still at 54% so the battery life is wildly impressive to me so far.Was kind of annoyed that the phone only comes with a cord and no wall outlet, especially since both ends of the cord is USBC so your old usb to wall adapter may not be enough. I expected this though and ordered a Samsung OEM charger. It cost me 40$ but after buying a thousand dollar phone that seemed like spare change so I happily shelled out the money.Beware of screen protectors!! I spent 60$ on three different kinds of screen protectors before I found one that fit and actually stayed attached. The curved glass screen makes this a difficult fit but I‚Äôd rather not use it without one. Make sure you are careful about what you buy and really read reviews, especially the bad ones. Don‚Äôt be fooled by brands that offer incentive for good reviews to hide the negative ones.The amount of cameras seems a bit excessive but I look forward to trying them. The zoom, I can tell, is already incredible and I can‚Äôt wait for a clear night to get some good shots.Overall I‚Äôm VERY happy with this switch.I did buy the phone during a promotion and got higher memory at a lower price with an additional 100$ off so I did pay 300 less than manufacturer‚Äôs price.",0.9541,0.16541889483065958,0.07947338306837848,0.05833460139015956,1.0,3.7193718e-06,1,0.46533294266585135,1,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,Positive,Neutral,95,83
"I owned a Z Fold 2 that lasted 3 years (beating every other phone I've owned by a year!) and it was the best phone I've ever owned so my standard for foldables is high and so far the first week has been fantastic.

I'm excited to learn more about the camera and haven't even begun to unleash the potential.  The value of this phone for the money is, so far, impressive.

"I'm gonna be honest, I'm a big tech guy and I've been following all kinds of smart devices and smart home configs and smart watches and computers and everything else for years, but this was my first experience using a folding phone, and it was incredible.The inner screen looked incredible and seemed very durable to me, I didn't do any kind of durability test on it or anything, but just from general use watching TV shows and playing games on it, I noticed no wear and tear at all.All the apps I tried to use did an amazing job resizing to fit the inner screen size, and I didn't have any apps that only did a partial screen fit which was really cool to see, so the app support is definitely there which is great.The inner camera definitely isn't like super great (especially for selfies), but if you take your pictures in a well-lit area they turn out significantly better. That being said, the general consensus from most of the people I talked to about this phone said it's recommended to only use the inner camera for video calls, and for selfies to just use the much better cameras on the outside of the device instead (there's a way to ""send the screen"" to the back (outside) of the phone and take selfies using the main lens instead, and those turned out incredible. Like seriously better than almost any other phone I've used.The last thing I just want to add is be prepared to adjust some of the default settings. First off, the screen would dim way more often than I wanted it to, so make sure to adjust it up to 2 minutes before it goes to sleep instead of 30 seconds. The other default setting to adjust is default brightness, go in and turn that off and turn on the extra brightness option and then set it to a comfortable brightness level. I think this phone keeps the auto brightness low all the time to save battery life, but it definitely ruins the experience a bit when your phone is that dim for no reason.Overall though, this phone is amazing and I couldn't be happier with it. The storage amount was fine, the camera quality was great, the battery was pretty good, the inner screen was amazing, and the phone was such a phenomenal experience to use every day.10/10, definitely recommend, get this phone, you will not be disappointed!",0.9983,0.22536706349206345,0.0008503516881911422,0.09134769282896604,1.0,7.1343806e-07,1,0.47369511734961084,1,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,Positive,Neutral,104,80

"I've been a Pixel person for many years now, but didn't have many options for an unlocked phone with near stockish Android and decent battery life.I will start by saying the phone doesn't have Alexa installed and it isn't required. Anyone giving it a poor review for that is misinformed.This phone seemed to be a better fit than a newer Pixel, but I was concerned with camera quality. The photos I've taken look really great and the camera app is very similar to the others I've used. I've taken several hundred pics since owning the phone and they have turned out almost as good (in some cases even better) than the ones taken with my Pixel 2 XL.I've installed all of my apps and been using it heavily and it gets significantly better battery life than my other phones. This was a big complaint and one of my primary reasons to upgrade. The screen on the 8 is really bright in Auto and adjusts well to surrounding light. Leaving the phone to adjust automatically has been fine most of the time and I rarely change it myself.The Warp Charging is absolutely amazing. Plugging it in for a short amount of time charges the battery up enough to use for hours. This wasn't really a huge selling point for me, but it did make me quite happy when I used it.The build quality and looks are impressive too. It just feels like a premium phone. The Interstellar Glow is an interesting color choice and it looks sogood in person. Any clear case will show off it's iridescent shine.Software has been a big win here. The simplicity of stock Android has always been appealing to me and getting away from that has been hard. You don't realize how much you were missing until you start using something like Oxygen OS on a OnePlus phone. You can change the icons on the entire phone with icon packs downloaded from Play Store. You can change the status bar, system icons, the color and shapes. So many things can be customized and it is so smooth.I was worried that I would spend the money to be let down, but this has been a great purchase.

I love this phone. It's solid but not too heavy. It's fast from switching from apps, tabs, and fast when charging. My only 2 complaints are 1). It seems like my Wi-Fi is constantly disconnecting on it's on and I have to constantly reconnect. Even though it's set to manually reconnect and my Internet works fine. It has to because I work from home. 2). Is that when I hold phone with my shoulder (when I'm cooking), my cheeks hits the buttons which is so annoying. (Yes I have ear buds but I lose them or have to remember where I last saw them). But the screen should lock so that it doesn't do that. Instead I have to manually lock it myself. Not a deal breaker there but the wi- fi disconnecting does have me want to look at my warranty info. If it weren't for that this phone is a keeper for me. I'm an Android woman and I don't need a lot of bells and whistles even though I'm sure this phone can do a lot. I just need to find where I put the manual..lol",0.7987,0.09404761904761905,0.03417273322002501,0.015685608292937928,1.0,0.8951498,1,0.5482508267948659,1,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Positive,Positive,Positive,Neutral,58,52

"I wanted to love this phone.  Really, I did.  But, I don't.  The screen size is good both when closed (like a regular phone) and when open (like a small tablet).  But, the operating software itself is, to put it nicely, very buggy and I personally find the larger screen of limited use.  There just isn't enough software optimized for it to make it valuable.  That said, the stuff that is designed for it is really quite nice.Unfortunately, the camera ""bump"" is more like a mountain and is extremely obtrusive.  Like, really, really huge.  And what in the absolute **** is up with a phone in 2024 that does not have wireless charging built in???  Yes, the high-speed wired charging is great.  But not being able to simply top-up with your car's wireless charger or missing the convenience of just dropping it on a Qi charger when going to bed is absurd.

Phone is great but it has issue with connecting correctly to cell tower. Lived in US and using t-mobile but when calling other people can hear me but I can't heard the other caller. It only when connecting to other people network like AT&T or Verizon connection is not stable. But calling to a land line there no issue. I think it has to do with the software that is on China version and not US. Bought another one with US.

"I purchased this to replace my Samsung Ultra S22 and have been using it for a little over a week now. I did attempt to trade in for a flip 5 at one point, but that camera was... bad, so I ended up keeping my Ultra. There are obviously many differences between the two, the camera being just the first. I'll go into some including - Overall feel, Camera, Screen, Fingerprint sensor, Charging and Battery Life, and OtherOverall feelIt feels quality. It doesn't feel like a phone that might shatter or snap in half when I inevitably drop it down the steps, but I'll report back when that happens. The hinge is solid. It is not the hinge of the old days where you can flip the phone open at a snap of the wrist. You will need a second hand. The phone stays in positions from lie flat all the way down to the smallest of degrees without closing or changing the angle.CameraThe Ultra's camera is better by miles, but that is something you probably know going in. The flip's camera is now very serviceable, and Samsung has some sort of wizardry that helps that along cleaning up your somewhat blurry zoomed in pictures for you. It feels like I don't need to carry around a second item for photos, and since every day is not a vacation, I'm good with that. If you are a selfie person, you can leave the phone closed using the outside screen to take your selfies getting the full power of the main lenses unlike other devices where you get the lessor selfie cam lens, making this camera better in at least that use case.ScreenScreen, yeah, you can see and feel where it folds. In my opinion, it isn't terrible, though. It's the price of having a foldable phone, and with the screen on at a normal viewing angle, that fold line isn't present for me. The screen feels nice, even over the bump, though you can tell it is not the same super durable S22 Ultra glass. Leave the preinstalled screen protector on.The screen is nearly the same length as the S22 Ultra, but it is narrower. With the phone open, the narrowness can make the phone a little tricky to hang on to if you are trying to one hand the phone and touch buttons at the bottom of the screen. I can't quite put my finger on it, but it does feel like somewhat of a balancing act compared to the heartier S22. The width of the screen has, I think, also played havoc with one of my weather apps sometimes not showing some information, but otherwise hasn't bothered me.The screen feels big enough, and is also not an endless display, so I welcomed back some bezels. Having bezels back has actually been kind of nice as the endless had a tendency to pick up errant touches on the sides.FingerprintThe flip fingerprint sensor is on the power button, and works very well... almost too well. It picks up my fingers even when I'm not trying to unlock my phone. There is a setting that will fix this so that the sensor only works when cover or main screen is on, but I like only having to touch the button to wake up the phone, so this is my tradeoff.Charging and Battery LifeIt isn't slow, but it is not Super fast like the S22. It guesses about 1:15 to go from 50%-100% where as the S22 would go from 0-100% in less than an hour using the same cable and brick. I am rarely away from a charger anymore, so it's fine, but I can see it being inconvenient for those times where I want a quick shot of juice. It won't give that same bang for the 5 minutes.The battery seems to last about the same amount of time as the S22. Basically a full day depending on my uses. If I'm playing games throughout the day (which I won't get into other than to say I haven't noticed any performance difference between this and the S22, which is a good thing), the battery drains more quickly and might not make it a full day, but that is to be expected, and was the case with my S22, and basically every other phone I've had as well. If you use it like a phone with a camera, you should be fine from wake to sleep.OtherGoogle assistant. I'm not sure if this is Samsung's fault or not, but if you tell Google to do something with the phone closed, the outside screen will tell you to open the phone to complete the command. This is absurd, and one of the main reasons, even with all the other nitpicks, that I can't give this 5*. Maybe this gets fixed in a future update (probably not, though, I imagine we are going on 5 years of this). If I need to pull my phone out and open it up, I'm probably doing whatever task I needed done all by my self. Bixby does work from the outside screen, though, so this is the first time I've ever had it enabled (though it is super limited in comparison).",0.9923,0.05746031746031747,-0.1775498527052033,0.12240149783210086,1.0,2.0451712e-06,1,0.42780200110834304,1,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,Positive,Negative,217,152

"I am new to Samsung phones and after owning this Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 AI Cell Phone for several days I was finally ready to switch over from my old iPhone.Spectrum refuses to activate this phone because it was not financed through them.I read the sales page and I see no mention that before purchase a buyer should check with their mobile service provider to see if they can even use this phone.When I asked the Spectrum representative when they might be ready to activate this Samsung Fold he could not provide me with a date.Since I cannot add this phone to my current mobile plan, I am not able to review it as a phone.This mobile phone to be sold barebones, it just incudes a C type charging cable, but, as a new Samsung user, I really needed a new user bundle. Since this phone does not include a wall charger, I had to scramble to find a way to charge it.I'd prefer that anxiety not be a part of my new user experience!This phone comes with the bare minimum of instructions. I would like that a full new user guide be included in my desired new user bundle!Since the minimalist instructions did not mention how to actually fold this Fold, I had to take a risk and bend it like...I might be about to break it. Thankfully it bent folded very easily!This Z Flip 6 is about as wide as my iPhone SE, which I can now no longer call my 'old"" phone. Since Spectrum won't activate this new one it has now been reinstated as just my plain old ""phone"". I like that the width of this new Fold is about the same as my SE because I do not have to relearn how to hold this new phone.I like that this phone folds because I am accustomed to storing my SE in a small outer pocket of my purse. When folded this Flip can fit into the same pocket.This Z Flip 6 seems to suck down it's battery life at about 1% per hour when fully opened, however, it charges very quickly. I am not an expert on mobile phones so it's entirely possible that something that I have running is causing the rapid loss of battery life.I had another small bout with anxiety when I decided to see how my music sounded on this Fold. Without a user's manual I had to look on the internet to see where my music went. I learned that my music files went to You Tube music. I love You Tube so that was okay with me. My music sounds great on this phone!I am disappointed that I cannot currently use this Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 AI Cell Phone as my mobile phone unless I am willing to sign up with another mobile carrier and get a new phone number and have two mobile phones. No thanks.I think that the sales page for this and for all mobile phones should include a warning to check with your mobile carrier before purchase.

The Fold5 is sleek elegant and very lightweight and durable compared to my Fold3 5G because I can tell they took out what wasn't needed and put in what was needed aka BETTER HINGES this Fold5 is sturdy the build quality you can feel and setting it up on my network TM at least was a breeze. Definitely worth the pennies. I plan on having this for a long time. Just need a good case. Performance is a no brainer better processor and gpu built in then the SD888 and AD650 IF you game this is the phone for you. I'm definitely enjoying the size is just right like they say just slip into your pocket and it's like it's not even there compared to older models. The phone is just nice to look at too period and the box came in perfectconditionno scratches and all that so no complaints there.

"iPhone user so this is a big change and to be fair I am reviewing this for all but the cellular part. I have yet to get a new SIM for it and have been using it on wifi. The screen, colors are amazing, bright and beautiful.  The fold function is pretty awesome.  It's like carrying around a mini iPad.  The case I am using on it, the I just reviewed has a kickstand so can you pop it anywhere and watch streaming content.  Form factor is good for its size.  Height wise it is just a bit taller than my iPhone 13Pro.  Thickness folded is more than double the size.  The snap on case also adds to the overall heft.  For those that have both android and apple there is an app that allows you to send and receive imessages on android so that has eased the transition for me. The device is pretty responsive with about 30 apps on it so far.  Camera is sharp.  Wireless charging is uses the fast charging standard and the device tells you when it is in fast charge mode. A few things I don't like.  From a device hardware perspective the camera facial recognition is not great. It fails more than it works. The fingerprint sensor works about 90% of the time.  Battery life is average.  For whatI am using it for it drains pretty quickly.  The rest of the dislikes are really around android and while I know the implementation is customized for the device I cannot really give the device negative marks for it.

"When I went to buy the phone I had my reservations because of all of the buyer beware comments. But when I got the phone and put my sim in. Any reservations I had went away. It fired right up and stared working like it was supposed to. After further inspection I noticed that the phone said it was an a6013 model and looked it up to no avail. So I called OnePlus and spoke with them about the model number. They told my that the only major difference with the a6010 and a6013 was that the a6013 was the dual SIM China unlocked model and that even if I did receive that phone instead it would have still functioned fine here in the US. The sim slots and startup screen are the only differences between the phone.The only down side about buying the one that I did. Is it didn't come with a charger or cable and if you want to use dash charging or any kind of fast charging on the oneplus 6t you will need a charger that works with their proprietary charging system.

"This is one of the cheapest snapdragon 8 gen 2 phones you can get if you snagged it during Prime Day. I can finally play Genshin Impact at 60 fps without lag! I came from a Galaxy S10E and the size of the base model is perfect and similar. I used to have to use my S10E's hotspot to play Genshin on my 2021 iPad mini. With the new Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor it can keep up with the iPad mini's A15 so I was able to sell it!I love that there's a stop charging at 85% feature. I used to have to root to get such features.A few reasons for the 4 star rating... The side thumb fingerprint reader of the S10E was superior. It was faster, had less false readings, and was not in the way of a screen protector.The camera is also lackluster with a lot of noise and artifacts. It feels like there's too much post-processing going on and AI doesn't seem to get it right. I'm not sure if it's a software issue and hope Samsung improves it with newer updates.I also miss the microSD slot, and headphone jack. To compensate for the lack of microSD, I pre-ordered a sharge disk to get portble blazing fast nVME storage with this phone usb-c port.

"Was very worried whether I could get a provider, because I was with Straight Talk with my last phone and I couldn't find information that Straight Talk worked on this OnePlus 11 phone. I went from an A51 Samsung Galaxy phone to the US Factory OnePlus 11.  I took the Sim card out of the Samsung and put it in the OnePlus 11 and I had service right away.I know I couldn't keep the new phone on the old Sim, so I went to get a new Sim Card, but ended up buying a Simple Mobile SIM card which is a sister company to Straight Talk. Had to call into Simple Mobile to set it up though.  It would not just setup. However, when I called customer service and they sent me codes, they asked me questions, such as ""what is your pin"", etc. and I couldn't answer them because I was not setup with Simple Mobile.  I kept saying I am not getting codes from Simple Mobile and I haven't setup security questions with Simple Mobile.  Later during the conversation I noticed I was getting messages from Straight Talk.  I then found out the same people I was speaking with work for both  Straight Talk and Simple Mobile. So, my codes were in another email address I set up for Straight Talk.  The security questions they asked me that I couldn't answer, were actually the Security Questions I setup in Straight Talk.  Was confusing.Want people to know, I just did not want to order a SIM from Amazon or Straight Talk and wait a few days to get it. That is the only reason I didn't set it up with Straight Talk. The IMIE number did work with Straight Talk. I tried it also with Google Fi and Verizon.  Verizon actually recognized the ESIM as well. So, I was surprised. So, my answer to, ""Will this phone work with Straight Talk?"" Yes it will and it also works with Simple Mobile.I bought the Simple Mobile Bring your Own Phone 4G LTE and 5G Sim Card. It was $1.00.  But they charged me another .55 cents for 911 emergency fee for the Sim Card.  When I signed up with Simple Mobile to be my actual provider, I noticed I am charged again .55 cents for 911 emergency fee?The look is different then what is in the pictures.  It is not a dark green.  In fact it is sort of a light blue green.  It is very nice looking and a wonderful surprise. I would say it is more of a marine blue. Laying down with a clear cover on the back of it. It is a light green/gray color.How fast it charges is amazing.  15 to 20 minutes and it is fully charged. Love it!It was very easy to setup.  I used the Google backup method, by backing up my old phone to Google Drive and then uploading from Google Drive to the new phone.  All my apps were setup automatically. I just had to put in my internet credentials and email credentials and I was all set.One thing I noticed was I couldn't shut the phone off. Apparently you press the power button on the right and have to hold the volumn up on the left at the same time to get the power option to shut it off. I didn't like that...so I went into Settings and went to Additional Settings and went to Power Button Menu and then to the Press and hold the power button menu and checked off the Power Menu instead of the Voice Assistant.Now all I have to do is press the right hand button and hold it and I get the Power off menu.  I did this because everytime I went to power down the phone by using the right power button, the Google Voice Assistant popped up.  Couldn't stand it, so I changed that button to just be Power on and off by doing the above.I know I read previous reviews stating this problem, but I don't think anyone said how to change it. So, this is for people like me, who don't want the google assistant coming up when they are trying to shut their phone off.I will try setting it up with my car next, but I really don't expect any problems. The service has been good so far and am not having any problems with text, voice or data.I didn't like the lock screen clock. It was weird as it separated vertically the hour and the minutes.  I was able to change that by going to Settings, then Wallpapers & Style, then menu option: always on Display and then changing the clock.  There are not a lot of options there.  But, maybe I can download something on Google Play.So, far very happy customer.Update:  Works with Android Auto. Set it up in my car with no problem.  Was tricky as I didn't understand what I was doing. Plugged it into my USB port in the car and plugged the other end of cord to the phone.  Went to menu in car and put on BT Pairing and went to my phone and swiped down to get Bluetooth.  It said available devices and gave me some sort of at numbers and letters that had no sense to it one way or another and I pressed that on the phone and then pressed BT pairing on the car menu and I then saw Car Audio and it asked me if I wanted to pair or accept that, so I pressed yes.  Called someone and it came over my car radio which was perfect.  Make sure car is on when you do all of this and it does say to have it in park.  I don't think it mattered in my case.  I have an older 2015 car and it worked fine.  I got calls in and they also went out.  Perfect!  The google mapping worked perfectly on my phone giving me direction by direction.Bought a second US Factory OnePlus 11 5GB for my husband and setup Android Auto and it gives us google mapping on his car dashboard with no problems.",0.9985,0.18591806567416327,-0.07057035622571595,0.030568765464871195,1.0,1.3565185e-06,1,0.44920254734740406,1,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,Positive,Negative,285,199

"Phone was in good condition. Was skeptical of the model 901w since many have posted reviews of it being only usable in Canada. Although, it is the model from Canada, I had no problems activating it on my Verizon network. I would have given the seller 5 stars but my phone arrived with no sim card tray. Therefore making it very inconvenient to activate the phone in the time frame that I was trying to do so. The seller did correct the mistake and I had no problem communicating with the seller. For all the given reasons is why I gave the seller 4 stars and not 5. If the sim card tray would have been with the phone, this would have been a great transaction.

"This is an excellent smart phone at a reasonable price. My previous device was a Samsung ""Active"", which had an area fingerprint reader on the back surface that was nearly useless as it required the orientation and placement of my finger to be nearly perfect. This reader is essentially a linear array, and so well integrated into the inset-side-mounted on/off button that it is reliable, hence routinely useful. I purchased the phone through Amazon (good), and followed the on-line guide to transfer files and set it up (again, good). Transfering my activated AT&T account was another matter. The technical information that came with the phone made a point that a certain (specified) SIM card was required. To my eyes, that description did not match the SIM card in my Active. Calls to AT&T did not work. A visit to the local AT&T store at first was unsuccessful. The clerk shook his head and walked away, passing off my request to another agent. She pointed out that the SIM in my older Active was the correct variety, and in a few minutes had switched them out, tested, and verified that all was well. She told me that Samsung has used the same SIM card on all of their phones for the past several years. Easy peasy for the cognizenti :~) Other features...The back plate of this phone removes easily (without tools), allowing access to the innards. The battery may be removed (for security if required), replaced, or swapped out to be charged externally (extra equipment needed). There is an internal slot for another chip to increase storage.

"Marques Brownlee (MKBHD channel) reviewed the A54 and put it up against the S23 Ultra in 5 or 6 categories.

"For a while now, I've maintained that OnePlus and the Google Pixel range are the only good Android phones on the market. You might guess that I'm a fan of having a ""pure"" Android experience on my devices, and you'd be right. If you are like me and think that using a Samsung phone with all the ""value-added"" bloat is a torturous experience, then I'm sorry to say that I believe OnePlus is clearly going down that route.The moment I started setting up the phone, I could tell something wasn't right. There was too much flashy nonsense, but I got to the end of the setup and started looking around. Almost nothing is vanilla; you've got OnePlus's special homescreen, their icons, their apps, their theme. They've got ""wonderful"" value-added features that you can, admittedly, turn some of them off in the settings. But once you explore some more, you find a bunch of totally useless bloat.At the same time, while there's some bloat, it's still surprising how they manage to ruin Android such that right from the beginning, you notice pointless battery drain that shouldn't be happening. Not to mention, if you dig a little deeper, you'll find out about the stuff under the hood, OnePlus's special throttling, and you can read about their well-known benchmark manipulation and so on.Take a peek at forums, and you'll see people complaining about constant instability and old bugs never addressed, updates rolling out so slowly that some people only get an update after the subsequent version has already come out. Even for security updates, which frankly should be a big deal, they are still rolled out slower than they should be. The entire point of security updates for Android is that they're important, they're time-sensitive, and they're easy to implement, right?So, if you want this phone because you think you're going to get something like a vanilla or ""pure"" Android experience, please don't bother. In fact, just get a Samsung instead if you're willing to deal with annoying bloat. At least in that case, the hardware is better. OnePlus isn't even cheap anymore, anyway.",0.9721,0.10257936507936509,-0.09137924057710656,0.09406579813443727,0.0,3.2118057e-06,1,0.2967670192060613,1,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,90,65

"I use WiFi most of the time and my WiFi access is WiFi 6. WiFi 6 has been around since 2019 so it is hardly a new technology. The A54 5G repeatedly drops WiFi 6 connections even though all of my other phones hold it stable. I tried all of the usual remedies: Updates, Factory Reset, More Updates, different SIM, tried another A54 5G, nada, no joy! In most other respects the phone performed well. I found an article on the internet that the very same problem with WiFi 6 was happening with the S23 series. The article was several months old and one of the other phones I have is an S23 Plus and it held its connection to WiFi 6 stable.

Later found some fine scratches on the screen and initiate a return. Was pass around four times before getting a rep telling me to return for refund.

"I‚Äôve been using this phone for 3 weeks now and I absolutely love it. HIGHLY recommend this phone if you are into work productivity OR into gaming, as it does both with ease. I‚Äôve always been an iPhone and iPad kinda person, but this Samsung phone is literally like carrying a powerful laptop in your pocket. I‚Äôve been playing Pokemon Go, Pikmin Bloom, and Golf Clash while logging my walks on Runkeeper, chatting with work folks using Slack, engaged in Teams or Zoom meetings, opening MS Word and PPTX docs - this phone does it all.  I‚Äôm not even using a cell connection yet, I'm just piggybacking on my work iPhone hotspot, and yet this Z-fold outperforms it!  At 256GB, this phone goes above and beyond the processing capability of my other phones.The large, beautiful Z-fold screen makes this phone so unique, and adds extra usability. It‚Äôs like having a mini-tablet and a cell phone all rolled into one!  The ‚Äúback‚Äù screen is the tall narrow single screen that is utilized when the phone is folded/closed, and the ‚Äúfront‚Äù screen is the large rectangular screen that is twice as wide and very useful for work applications like word processing, slide shows and spreadsheets, and not to mention video calls. I like that it folds up small to fit in my pocket, and then folds out to give me a nice, big display screen when I need one.If you are thinking of investing in this phone, do keep in mind that it is heavy and slick, so if you plan on having it last, please invest in a case sooner rather than later!And lastly, the camera takes nice sharp photos, the phone has a very high quality screen display, and this phone also utilizes facial recognition as well as fingerprint technology, both of which have worked great for me - no issues there. Charging time is about the same as my other phones, BUT this phone seems to have a superior battery life compared to my other phones. For instance, under similar circumstances, the Z fold will still be at 70% while my other phones are already down to 40%!Overall, I think this unique phone is one of the best phones I have ever had, certainly one of the most versatile!",0.9973,0.17304802604802605,0.0001460229681945202,-0.011971576499137493,1.0,0.8921356,1,0.5786654418048958,1,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,102,65

"I just got this phone at the end of may 2024 . There is no damage to this phone that I have done myself. And I paid full price for the phone. There was no problem until now.  The protective black strip pulled up off the left hinge Exposing the glass underneath.. and on the right side of the phone, it wants to come off on the right hinge also. The customer service Has changed for Samsung And not in a good way, You have to fight to get a human on the line they want to text you or talk to AI . it was so hard to get a hold of someone and they told me it was going to cost me three hundred and forty something dollars to ship my phone to Samsung to be fixed Because the hinge is not under warranty. And I would not have my phone for a week or more. All  for them to replace the black protective strip on the phone.  I have been with Samsung for I don't know how long. Even with a year warranty through samsung and full coverage through my the cell phone service, i'm still going to have to pay three hundred and fifty dollars to have it fixed. When the whole phone should be fully replaced. I was willing to let them fix it until they told me I had to pay that amount When I just paid full price for the phone. I won't be going back to Samsung they lost a loyal customer and I'm sad the company has gone down hill so bad.

"Phone is awesome, I love the big screen, Phone  is super fast. After a little more than 2 months, I was on Instagram scrolling,  them I saw two one inch lines on the screen, I thought it was part of the reel I was watching but swiped up and it was still there. I closed the phone and opened it back up and then the two small lines became one big line, then by the end if the day, it looked like the Pic. The front screen still worked and the phone still worked. The part that sucks is they want it back to verify it's not physical damage. So for two weeks, you don't have a phone. I just called today since it been a week and I haven't heard anything and the lady said they no longer have the black one and asked if I want the green one, I said send what ever I need a phone. Basically the deal breaker here is you need a back up phone if anything happens to your phone,  they want your old phone first. Any other phone company or carrier, you have the insurance and you get new phone in the mail and put your old phone in the mail. When I get the new phone, I will sell it for like $1k and get a phone here with my carrier, that way if something does happen, I won't be out of a phone for 2 weeks.

"Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because it doesn't come with a block, and the charger it comes with could be significantly better otherwise; it seems to be an amazing phone off the rip. I just switched back to android after years of being with Apple I got tired of my phone being outdated so quickly and the lack of user customization. I was looking at this phone for a bit because I wanted a galaxy and in the past my old androids when I was young would slow down and lag after a week of use. I haven't had this one for even a week yet but it's clearing all my worries thus far. My first worry was will it really be ""unlocked"" or will I have to go through a series of emails and returns to get one that accepts my Sim. Nope, popped my Sim in from my iPhone xr (I use cricket) it prompted me to restart the device so it could configure to it and boom. It even auto went to 5g shortly after (xr doesn't support 5g). There's that, I was also worried it would lag or skip like the cheaper androids I assume I had when I was younger but, man, this thing is smooth! I did a bit of extensive research and I was debating between this and a used s23 at the same price but after much debate and the risks of buying a used phone no matter who the seller is I landed back here and I don't regret it. All the good features as the flagships and none of the useless ones at half the price. Battery seems great thus far, just know that with every phone if you treat the battery with no care it will degrade so do a little research. Condition was amazing. Came packed in a loose box kind of but the phones packaging itself that was inside the box won't let anything happen to it. My only tip is buy a case when you buy the phone, it's very smooth and nice but also slippery and will fall out your pocket very easily between motions so keep that in mind. Hope I helped!

"I have had this since January.  This is a great Android cell phone, as it seems to have missed most of the consumer-hostile trends in the mobile phone industry.  Unlike most current devices, this one has a replaceable battery, headphone jack, and SD card slot.  It also seems to be well designed and durable.  It is exactly the phone that I wanted, and I have been very happy with it.My only major complaint with the device itself is that it ships without a manual or charging device.  A PDF of the manual is available for download, but, for $600, a printed copy should come with the device itself.  I have not been able to find a service manual for this anywhere, unfortunately.I ended up getting the Koamtac charging cradle (not the Xcover model on Amazon), which charges using the pogo pins on the base of the device.  It is expensive, but works well.There does seem to be an issue with parts availability for this model in the USA.  I wanted to get a spare back cover for mine.  This is part number GH98-47657A, but good luck buying one in the US.  Samsung support send me to Samsung Parts, which does not sell that part and sent me back to Samsung support, which was useless.  Why are these parts not available in a web store for easy purchase?  I ended up buying spares from a company in Belgium (with inflated shipping prices), but it seems nutty that genuine replacement parts seem to be unobtainium in the US through official channels.Anyway, this is a good product, but Samsung needs to provide a service manual and better parts support in the US.",0.9841,0.2020833333333333,0.02447718029763357,0.0028010129046024262,0.0,4.8471594e-07,1,0.3162088587502157,1,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,74,55

"I like both iPhones and Android phones for different reasons and keep both in the family. The Samsung S23 is the best Android phone I've ever used, and that includes recent offerings from OnePlus, Google, Motorola and LG.Having used both phablet-style phones and smaller devices, I find myself gravitating toward the smaller S23. For me, it's just easier to grip, lighter and much easier to put in a pocket.Usually you have to sacrifice something between either speed or battery life. I'm happy to say this phone is both super speedy and has fabulous battery life despite the smaller size of the battery compared to the phablets. I can easily get through a day of moderate to heavy use, up to two days if my usage is a bit lighter.The screen is the best I've used on any phone, including the latest iPhone 15 Pro. It just has a pop to it with vibrant colors that don't feel overdone. Samsung's Android customizations are excellent and very helpful overall. Some complain about software bloat on Samsung phones, but this unlocked version doesn't seem to be loaded down.I'm not a camera expert, but in casual use, I find the camera on the Samsung S23 to be right up there with the iPhone 15 Pro.

Performance is great and battery descent. Charging is awesome either wirelessly or connected...

"This is a pretty solid phone with the interesting folding gimmick. The price point feels a bit high when compared to other phones on the market, but it works great and is very responsive. The new biometrics reader on the side was a bit of a surprise at how well it works and the camera is really nice, all of them, btw. The unfolded screen becomes large enough that you start seeing ""desktop"" resolution settings for website layouts, or you can dock apps to each half and run multiple at the same time, which is cool. You can't use the front screen with the inner screen, but that makes sense.

"I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5. The phrase ""everything is very good but not great"" applies to every aspect of this phone. In that respect, it is a lot like the Oneplus 11, just a little better in all areas. For example, the battery life is very good but not quite as good as you'd think it would be. The camera is very good but not quite as good as it could be. Same for the display, speed, the quality of the enclosure (the build quality) and every other conceivable thing a person would want out of a smartphone today, except that all of them lack SD cards. At least you get a charger with the Oneplus. Ok, I take it back, the charger is great, yep and one comes with it too ! The OS overlay, whatever it is, is good but not great. And so on. Oneplus has manged to hit the 8/10 bullseye with this because I don't have anything to complain about, except the totally needless complexity of the latest builds of Android, which is not Oneplus's fault.  And if you've seen the utterly needlessly complex latest versions of IOS, I consider Android to be less needlessly complex, by a few hairs.

"I got this phone in a rush, my previous one had died on me, so I ventured off Samsung and got the BlackView 9800 Pro w/ thermal camera, it was a good phone, falsely advertised as DUAL SIM though, plus I just couldn't handled using something different than Samsung, so I got this XCover Pro.Once again, falsely advertised as DUAL SIM, it's got a dedicated slot for a memory card, a slot for sim1, and a slot for SIM 2 which is totally inoperative, it doesn't even have the pins to connect to a card, it just an empty space!!So, if you're looking for a dual sim phone this is not it. Don't believe the review that says that there's a Samsung update coming up that will make the second slot operative.Coming from using Samsungs Active (my last one was a S7 Active) , this XCover feels fragile.Battery is just adequate for today's standards.I definitely need a Dual SIM phone, so, I'll give this one to my mom when I find a reliable one for me.Almost forgot, I use it with T-mobile, I can only get up 7-8 Mbps, according to them it's because the phone lacks one the bands in which T-mobile provides higher speeds.I get 50 Mbps when using an AT&T SIM card.Finally, $300-$350 should be a fair price for this phone, not $500!",0.9131,0.0515625,0.0035512246071789377,-0.21783226401630662,0.0,6.3414575e-07,1,0.2500545849623745,1,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,65,43
Through spectrum but I had an apple.My compliant wtih the apple phone is I never could hear well on it and others couldn't hear me well. No matter what I did. I never could hear my son on his phone either so I believed it to be an apple issue not a me issue. Apple phones for some reason sound so soft to me.So I switched back to the samsung galaxy. The phone is not my favouirte. Half the time it won't read my fingerprint. The pictures are OK but not as good quality as I excepted for a new phone. Limited features. And as it won't read my fingerprint very often I don't have to touch the xxx thing and like this morning it placed an order for me. apparently I can't remove my information without doing an entire factory reset.I hate you have to go to your contacts for phone number then an app for voicemail. I was told it had voice to text but my phone always says its unavailable. I can't use this bixby thing correctly and it makes it hard I won't set up to my blue tooth in my car so its useless. Picture taking is omg annoying. to screen shot I have to use two buttons on the same side at the same time. The entire phone is clumsy. I do not like it. I wasn't allowed to return it so now I'm stuck with this heap of crap until I decided to eat the cost and buy a different phone.Oh they have the volume control on the side so when you hold your phone in your hand it turns it up and down. I have resorted to having it on speaker phone all the time because I also hang up on everyone using it. I had ZERO issues like this with my other phones.I just don't like it.

"Writing this review roughly 3 months after owning this phone and using it daily. It's worked like a dream ever since day one, speaking from someone who's switched back and forth from iPhone to Samsung over the years. I can say that I prefer Samsung because of all the unique features, performance and build quality. The only real issue I had with the phone at first was that for whatever reason my text messages wouldn't send, but after a quick restart they did, so I wrote it off as being a carrier related bug. Aside from that, it's still the best phone that I've bought to date considering that my previous phone (The iPhone 13) which isn't that old at all, only ever gave me weird issues and poor battery life. Overall I can say that switching back to Samsung was so worth it some key features I like about this phone is how Customizable it is, as well as the 200x lens, and the 120hz screen. Not to mention the battery life is amazing, I can take it off the charger around 6:30 in the morning, and by the time I'm getting ready for bed which is typically around Midnight, I'm still left with anywhere from 30-40%.

"You certainly won't be buying this because of its (not) low price. But it provides a lot of features and especially unique extra ways to use all of its screen space. Almost all of my smart device usage has been in the IOS world ... and so a lot of what I am experiencing right now is just getting used to this new, slightly different way of doing things. But I am certainly not disappointed by anything thus far.My foremost favorite feature so far is just in the extra large, brilliant screen that this device has to offer. I suffer with some eye issues, but this large screen allows me to enlarge things to a size that is comfortable to view. Just this morning I was able to use it as my Sunday morning church service (digital) Bible which was so much easier to read than the paper version I had used previously. And even though it can be opened to be about half the size of a tablet for easy viewing, it can still be folded to easily fit into my shirt pocket. Plus it has powerful functionality in either format.With just a few days of usage I certainly can't say that I have explored anything more than the top surface layer of this super powerful device. But I am looking forward to getting acquainted with all that it can do once I get it more completely set up and configured to match my tastes and requirements.

Only one of those dozens of phones survived the first year intact and almost-fully functional.  Enter the S20FE.

A great looking phone, great features.First: Its Expensive for the brand... is a Samsung flagship price and Its not a Samsung.Second: 120 mhz is cool but will drain your battery in few hours...forget to used it on daily basis.Third : 800$ for a plastic back ???but I can handle thisthe problems began after few days that the phone star to resetting itself for no reason no matter if you are using it or not and did it with any app...after an investigation on internet there's a lot of people complaining for this and the solution for that is:  ....silence of the company ... nobody knows what happen with this one plus 8 PROMy question is why amazon sells this phone with this problems.But the best its coming, I returned the phone to amazon and buy a Samsung flagship for almost the same  price without waiting the refund (my mistake) and amazon after 10 days didn't refund the money they still saying they don't have the phone and UPS says was deliver 2 days after the return was made... after a few calls to amazon they finally said they have the phone but Its going to take 15 days to refund the money.. Why ??? Customer Services does not know and the web site still saying they didn't received the package back ... so my advice is when you buying  expensive tech stay way form amazonI've been prime member for almost 10 years  and in my house we buying from amazon on daily basis...so i know what I'm talking about",0.9509,0.09000000000000002,0.07898223227244205,0.09091445977256685,0.0,1.7640034e-06,1,0.31582835086405847,1,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,71,49

I was happy at first but then I wasn't getting my texts.  It took me awhile to figure out why. I went to Verizon got a new Sim card. Didn't work. Got a new phone from Verizon then I'm getting all my texts.  I was also supposed to have the a to z guarantee but their customer service said for me to kick rocks and since it was a 3rd party Amazon is screwing me too.

"UPDATED POST (30JUN24)For some reason, the phone is very ""slippery"" when placed glass-side down.  I have set the phone face down on surfaces like a kitchen or restaurant table with and without cloth and plastic table cloths, my pant leg when I am sitting down, the keyboard  and top of my laptop when it is turned off or closed, and other materials.When placed this way, if there is ANY slight sense of not being 100% level and flat, the phone will start to creep in the direction of the slant and make it way off of the device.  This is very annoying and concerning that it may sustain damage...especially since the frame and corners are plastic.My only solution it to put it face up (yet camera side down) where is seems to create a bit more friction and not creep off of the surface.  When trying to maintain privacy, I although I WANT to place it face down, I am fearful it will slide off of the surface.SOLUTION: Getting a thin silicone skin-type case for it has solved my issue.Note: Although I say ""I"" above, it is a combination of either me or my wife, as the phone is now hers, but I use it from time to time.ORIGINAL POST :I bought this for my wife. I have a newer Samsung S-series.This phone has everything I would want.I would gladly trade my S-series for it.What it is missing, compared to my S-Series:1) Wireless charging  If I really needed that I could get this for $10  (See end of this review for Amazon  TASUMATO Wireless Charging Receiver Qi Charger Adapter link)2) Thinness A35 is thicker (0.32"" vs 0.30"")3) Maybe speed? (Not noticeable enough for me)4) Too new for Verizon to recognize5) Read ""complaints"" about speed of fingerprint reader.  To me it is not significant.6) Size  A35 is taller (6.37"" vs 5.76""  )/wider( 3.07""vs 2.79"" ) ,  I like the smaller S-Series because so it does not stick out of  my back pocket like the A35.What is has that I wish my S-Series had1) Micro SD Slot2) Less that 1/2 the price.3) Battery almost 2x as big4) Android 14 is its first OS. Which means it will be supported longer than my S-Series (release with Android 13)  with another Android O/S update.Since this is an Unlocked version, Verizon doesn't sell a similar version (even a Verizon locked version) yet, and it has only been out since Mar/APRIL 2024, I had an issue with Verizon.The only issue I had was getting a physical 5G nano SIM installed for it from the local Verizon store.I used the old Verizon 3G SIM I had (from the phone I was replacing) in this new phone until I could get to the verizon store. No issues.When the Verizon ""tech"" tried to scan the phone, it would not come up in his database. Thus he couldn't link it to the new SIM in an automated way (and he did not know how else to do it).He said ""We usually have this issue with Unlocked phones.""I think it was just because it was so new.So, he set it up via eSIM.  He did some testing and found no issues.I ran it this way for a while without issue.I also got him to give me a new blank Verizon 5G SIM. (It was no good to me unless Verizon registered it anyway).I called Verizon customer support. Since I had a blank Verizon 5G SIM, they were able to void the eSIM and get my 5G physical SIM to work over the phone.So, no real ""issues"" with Verizon, just an inconvenience.NOTE:I did not set it up with face recognition or the fingerprint reader for security reasons.WIRELESS CHARGING RECEIVER ADAPTER from AMAZON:https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Charging-Receiver-Charger-Adapter/dp/B09T9192P1/ref=sr_1_7?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.XikiZ2djR8Rm8GopWoXVrA6AtYSRHayCogLn1kB5WU1S1MxZpSygtHxk2SoP8HhoTmeYF_C9UDcXTJbQfQvHkiFALl_olKSl3jH1Kr2lBa2mHnkXagvaC0d1QDHVq2ia76qe0msNIOLPW8CEfpderibezU531235JojJLrHVl0ezvGYDTYPDr9cO3-X6l09LEsoaOhkw0GzjX5EsJIKh71KnLblw7KQ1dHYPBzj199A.YtasrLm4IwzJ-ZHKuwzoNLE3v11As-gdgSzdTnxyzf4&dib_tag=se&keywords=wireless+charging+adapter&qid=1717338850&sr=8-7",0.8109,-0.030134680134680153,-0.7731338973577027,0.15386674422720548,0.0,2.7281765e-06,1,0.16592869927304163,1,Positive,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,171,114

"The build quality is solid, and premium feeling in the hand. It has some weight to it, but is still less than say an iPad Mini.Performance wise, I have been able to play some Guitar Hero 3 for Wii (using the right adapters of course) in Dolphin - surprisingly solid performance and now capable of jamming while on the road. Standard mobile games and most applications will not stretch the specs on this one, but emulators definitely will. I have paired this with an amazingly thin case and the Razer Kishi controller for the ultimate emulation and streaming beast on the go.My choice came down to price, as I was originally going to go with the Sony Xperia 1 III. That choice also lost me some options in the process such as the awesome 3.5mm jack and DAC combo, and the micro SD slot (I have multiple ranging from 128GB to 1TB for storage away from my server (away from civilization)). Sony is the only top end option for those points but at nearly double the price that I bought the OnePlus 9 Pro at. 256GB of storage will be a little thin for my uses but I can manage.TL;DR - for the price, this is the best top-end phone of 2021.

"I will only buy a Samsung phone for many years I was Moto person.  But they have horrible tech support and the phones are ONLY updated for two years.  NOT from date bought but date released which means many are out of date as far as updates go, again they and most other Android makers only update phones for two years if that..  I was going to buy a apple but I do not like all the limitations for them.Well I started deep research and found out that Samsung is the only company doing security updates for 5 years.  And on the models that have the KNOX security it is almost as good as it gets without being rip off by Apple's over price products.I first bought the A54 3 months ago for $400.00 and I believe it is one of the best phones for the money and it has the Knox well my wife needed a new phone and I bought the Samsung A14  for $199 it is excellent no it lacks the Knox security but is covered for 5 years of updates.  The only downside to the A14 is the finger print reader is in the on/off button.  That is a draw back unlike the A54 that it pops up on the front very easy to use.  Unlike the A14.  But that aside I love both of these phones and Samsung tech support is good not great but very good.  Just my thoughts.  I think anyone wanting to save money and get a great phone here they are.",0.9937,0.27644570707070704,-0.2534699323790135,0.06365974970151278,1.0,1.7000697e-06,1,0.4400481749232687,1,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,Positive,Negative,66,47

"Got the phone, transferred the Sim and SD card from s9+ turned on and worked without any problems. Used Samsung Smart Switch and Google play to transfer apps and files from old phone to the new phone. Had to re-setup all the MFAs I use for work, but was expecting that. Love the in screen fingerprint scanner. Much easier to use then the back scanner I used on the S9+. It will miss from time to time, but especially at work where I have to do MFA authorizations many times throughout the day when connecting to user's computers and servers to check settings or perform remote fixes it is so much easier to press my thumb to the front of the screen than having to pull off the wireless charger to scan from the back. Battery life is great. Old S9+ could barely make it through a normal 8 hour shift and sometimes it wouldn't. The S20 FE makes it through a 12 hour extended shift with more than normal MFA with 27% battery still left. Can't really speak to the camera as if I am wanting to take good pictures I will pull out the Canon Rebel. For quick snaps of serial numbers, model numbers and things like that it works fine. Hands free is much clearer than on the S9+ as I don't get crackling or distortions on the S20 FE.

"Excellent experience and a great introduction to Foldables. User experience is very smooth and fast. Navigating the interface felt intuitive. Multitasking is amazing on this device and features to activate them should be the standard in the industry. The leather back is quite nice it is soft and adds texture to grip the phone with a case. Camera quality is better than the quality on Samsung folds in my opinion, but the bump is outrageously large. If you get pass the look, it is understandable to hold the phone and use it like any other digital camera. Also it gives a nice ledge rest on your fingers while you use the front screen...

"Have owned an S3, S4, Note 4, and now S6.  Samsung makes an excellent product. The S6 was for my son who is at college studying to be an engineer.  He LOVES this phone.  The phone is fast, sleek, logical, intuitive and highly functional.  We are amazed at each successive generation for the improvements and innovation that bring the Samsung product along.  One benefit not often though of is that Samsung seems to develop and support software updates more frequently.  They roll out the updates to many other older generations of their lines too which means your phone stays much more functional and safe for the time you own it.  Some brands do not seem to roll out updates as Samsung does-it is not that there are issues but that they constantly innovate.  This fact along is reason enough to purchase a S6 but paired with the excellent aesthetics and quality build-you can't go wrong.**Please note-I do not recommend trading in your old cell phone through Amazon. The phone that this new S6 replaced was sent in it's original box, in perfect working order with excellent battery & original equipment cables having been protected by cases & screen protectors throughout it's 2 yrs of usage. It very clearly met the criteria listed for being in the top tier yet it was downgraded to a lower value. After it a long shipping voyage there, now they shipped it back (not yet received!) taking many weeks!  Amazon evidently uses vendors to evaluate trade ins-had I know it was a third party then I would never have bothered!  This is a money making venture but not for you the consumer. Don't make the mistake of factoring in a trade in for your purchase of a new phone.  If you do decide to flip the coin and try it-take photos of the phone, photos of serial numbers and photos of every single thing.  I do not recommend that you use Amazon trade in for your old phone.  This one was in perfect condition and only 2 years old top quality-premium phone still sold today!  Better to keep it as a spare of donate it & write it off your taxes.  Very frustrated and extremely dis-satisfied by the trade in experience-especially as it was through Amazon.  I honestly expect more and this will influence whether I purchase another phone through Amazon or if I go to my carrier who had an offer of $100 for trade in value on this phone. Lesson learned-it pays to shop around and factor in your trade in value with the purchase but I choose to be loyal to Amazon rather than my carrier.Some things we don't like are NO SD card!  Though you can readily use cloud services of many kinds to safeguard your info, many of us still prefer to have that SD card.  I also am not a huge fan of not being able to remove the battery myself.  This model moves towards the Apple method of doing things where any little thing you want done has to be done at a store, shipped in or can't be done!Screen:The Gorilla glass is excellent and top quality. The clarity and resolution of the screen is outstanding-just when I thought my Note 4 was the greatest, they go and improve within the few months between the time that it came out and the new S6.Conclusion:I highly recommend this phone.  We have two tablets, and have had five Samsung phones and been very happy with them all.  They work well together and the quality is outstanding.",0.999,0.32860901219992134,0.0007187663789927634,0.004039209796619373,0.0,4.4214576e-06,1,0.33319591569044205,1,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,139,113

I did a ton of research when I needed a new phone. I always get unlocked phones to use on any GSM carrier. I am currently using Cricket wireless and I get LTE everywhere. I was coming from an LG G5 RS988 which was a great phone but not with a cracked screen. I needed something with an awesome chipset and a great screen. Not too big though. This for the bill. The front mounted fingerprint scanner and hardware back and recent buttons are what really attracted me to this device. No need to lift the phone to unlock it and more screen real estate without soft nav buttons. This phone is still being updated with security patches from OnePlus and the open beta supports project treble. There's a ton of software development for this phone as well if you want a custom ROM or kernel. I'm running the most current OxygenOs release with a custom kernel and the battery life is amazing! The cameras take great pictures and the watermark is an awesome feature.

"For those that like a foldable phone, the mechanics are super solid.  I genuinely LOVE the fingerprint reader located on the side power button. It makes unlocking the phone a breeze and in my month or two of using it, it has been a flawless process. The phone itself is very attractive and eye catching (have gotten multiple comments on it at work). The folding mechanic in conjunction with Google Translate can make for a very helpful experience when travelling. The Samsung Galaxy/Android user experience was very nice, no complaints. Camera was pretty much on par with previous Pixel phones in my experience.The phone is generally much more sensitive to dirt/sand due to folding mechanics (be very careful at the beach!) While not horrible, the actual fold crease in the screen is a bit annoying especially if you watch a lot of media on your phone the way I do. Screen seems to have more glare than previous smartphone (I believe this is due to the foldable screen protector) and it always just looks a little lumpy in the middle of the screen when you have it fully open.Ability to add apps to home screen is very helpful (although it requires an additional app that doesn't come default with the phone) but, otherwise, the limited amount of dedicated widgets for the cover screen was a bit disappointing. The AI features while potentially fun, really didn't seem to use much of a functional purpose to me, but might appeal to a younger user.  It does get points for being much more comfortable in my pocket and being very compact.Ultimately, I think if you are not bothered by the fold in the screen because you don't watch movies on your phone regularly and you are looking for an ultra compact phone with all the bells and whistles, this is a great option for you.",0.9873,0.1853667953667954,0.00014261782579060023,0.0049268762823102925,1.0,2.6494472e-06,1,0.45396270556029894,-1,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,Positive,Neutral,77,55

"Firstly I was pretty skeptical of purchasing an unlocked phone never owning one before but so far this device has been nothing but first class performance. The only issue I have had so far is with getting this masterpiece to do wifi calling, but I have this same problem with my Galaxy S20 Plus and was able to figure out how to get it working and I have high hopes that the same will happen here. I have tried the moon zoom and it was spectacular. I love the size of this phone though I wish Samsung had at least made it the same size as the Galaxy S22 Ultra which is 6.9 inches, but however I can still work with 6.8 inches. I love the bigger screen phones because they are better for conducting business on the go and of course videos, movies and photography. Love the brightness of the screen and need I not mention the S Pen which I always wanted. Though it's true that this phone is pretty expensive, still, all in all it's worth every single penny for everything thing that has been put into it including hours of labor and time. I didn't want to upgrade my Galaxy S20 Plus this soon, but after seeing the moon zoom and the fact that this phone featured the popular S Pen, I have no other choice but to dive in, besides life is too short to not have the things we work hard for, so with that said I pampered myself to this device that I hope to have for many years to come. I seen in the reviews where someone stated that the phone will not charge past 85 percent. Go to settings, battery and device care followed by battery and then more battery setting and turn off the protect battery setting if you want your device to charge the entire 100 percent. However keep in mind that keeping this setting turned on increase the life of your battery when it only charges to 85 percent. Sound quality has also improved once again in this device and that is something that I love as well. I guess the even better part is the updates that is going to hopefully follow to put the icing on the cake because, as far as the hardware..... it's all there. Samsung has even stepped up their game and threw in McAfee on this one, so with that said, I stepped mine's up as well and bought the package deal from McAfee that will protect up to 10 devices. People, you ain't going to get better than this. This phone is super fast. I'm going to miss the memory card slot but just like the headphones port, I'll get over it quickly for all that this phone packs, I say so long memory card slot, welcome home Galaxy S23 Ultra.Update: 5/28/23.After having this phone longer, I've discovered more about it. The Bluetooth feature in this device is much faster than the one on my S20 Plus. My Galaxy Watch now connects instantly, where in my S20 Plus it took a few seconds to connect. I have been loving this phone so much that I have decided to replace the original plastic S Pen that came with it with the aluminum one to do my own part of keeping high-end products matched up with high-end products as I did with the case, going with the Otterbox Defender series pro case for this baby. I've heard people mention having dropped calls on Samsung phones, however I have not experienced that in this device this far into ownership. The photo of the Cellular Tower I took using the camera on this phone was taken from about a mile and some change away and I was zoomed to around 30mm out of 100, just to give you a better idea of what the camera on this device can do. I am very tickle with the benchmark results of this device, very, very beautiful results. Still waiting to see what it will do with a full moon not to mention the very popular ""Super Moon"". After using this phone for nearly two months now I still must say that it has been an amazing experience. I have also noticed where some are unfairly reviewing the phone, either you have a defective device or is not doing something right. The battery should be no less than 5 stars, and I personally would give it 10 stars if I could for being a perfect 10. I have gotten at least 4 days out of my phone off a single charge, I have also noticed where the fingerprint scanner got an unfair low rating, again if you use it right it will work right. Since setting this area of the phone up I have not once had any problems with the fingerprint scanner picking up my fingerprint, even when I have done it snappy it has never failed to work. So far on this device, I have not experienced any of the dropped calls that I hear about since the very moment I inserted my sim card into this phone. At last, I was able to take a few photos of the popular supermoon. Wasn't that clear of an evening here but I still must say that the camera on this phone did an awesome job capturing it at 230mm and around 7mp.",0.9993,0.200403040734366,0.046595656907584715,0.031148413368194128,0.0,3.1467537e-06,1,0.3253500368234021,1,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,209,174
"They (most reviewers) said it was overstated, but that was an overstatement.  The camera image and video quality is very poor throughout.

"I just received my White S6 128gb on Saturday & so far I have enjoy using it. I'm not totally loving the battery life because it really doesn't last very long. I had a HTC M8 before & with power saving on,  I was able to get at least 12 hrs of normal use (like surfing on social medias, texting, checking email,  YouTube). With the S6 with the same settings, if lucky,  I get 12 hrs with light use (barely using my phone except when I receive messages or phone calls).  We have a history of HTCs started to crap out on us after 2 years, so I decided trade in for the HTC, since I remember how much I loved the S3, for the S6. Plus my fiance loves his Note4, and wants me to get a Samsung. So far my pictures are way better than what I getting from my HTC, but I do miss my speakers; it is something to get use to. I really hope this phone will last me for a long time by I'm planning  to use it 2+ years, & I hope Samsung creates a bigger battery for the S6, I'll will definitely love my phone then.",0.9768,0.11406666666666668,0.07434392792713362,0.1354100221307042,1.0,2.2850193e-06,1,0.4715175573919669,0,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,Positive,Neutral,53,35

"I'm disappointed that only the international version has an FM tuner, and that this wasn't explained until I contacted Samsung tech support chat. On the other hand, it has a replaceable battery, microSD card slot, and headphone jack on a rugged Samsung phone in 2021. It is also made in veitnam instead of China. This is what sold me on it, the fm tuner would have just been a bonus. Finger print reader is just OK. Maybe it's just my fingers that get cut up at work, but the old AGM X2 had a larger sensor on the back of the phone that never complained that my finger wasn't all the way on the sensor. AGM X2 had a 6000mAh battery, and this XCover just doesn't hold a candle to it battery life wise with its 4000ish battery. But it's replaceable, so I plan on buying a spare or two.I also don't like the fad of putting the camera inside the screen, it's like a constant circle of dead pixels. The iPhone notch wasn't any better. Just give me my larger bezel back. Oh well, I'll probably get used to it eventually.

"This phone is honestly great. Unlocked for your phone carrier and you could also unlock the bootloader too and root, install custom roms etc. I bought this at the time since it was one of the last oneplus phones that gave customers access to msm tools which allows you to restore your phone if you somehow mess up installing custom roms. The phone is fast, amoled screen looks nice and crisp. The snapdragon 888 processor is fast but it does heat up. I've rooted the phone and simply underclock it so it actually stays nice and cool all the time and even extends the battery life.If you're deciding between an older flagship and a midrange phone, I think pretty much you're always going to get a better deal with an older flagship (betters specs) unless you need a specific feature from a budget phone like sd card or phone jack.My only real complaint about this phone is the in-display fingerprint reader.

"Looked at the iPhone 6s.  This is the phone to get.  It has the right size and the software has more options. Looked at the S6 Edge, but since I put my phones in an Otterbox case, it would have been a waste. After over six months, I am very happy with it.  I love just sitting in on the fast charger and having it ready to go in less than an hour. Nothing to plug-in. Waiting to see how the battery holds up, but so far, so good. It gets me though a day even with the bluetooth activity and connection to the Weather channel. I had a Droid Razr before . Also a great phone.  Lasted a long time.

"First things first, I have many Samsung devices in my household so in terms of quality they are usually some of the best. My primary phone is a Samsung Galaxy S22 and it's been so great I was expecting to keep stay with that phone for year but the opportunity to check this one out arose.Goods:This is a very high quality phone. The build is great, it's slim, has a satisfying hinge close, solid quality speakers, screens look great, and I can go on. It's obviously got all the new bells and whistles in there. Galaxy AI is the new thing with it. It includes translation features, summarizing websites, notes assist with formatting/decorating, and photo/drawing assists. They seem to work fine but honestly not game changing in terms of day to day use. The massive folding screen is cool. It's got a function where if it's like half open you can use the bottom part as a mousepad+other functions and the top part as your screen. Not all apps support it very well but most basic ones I've used work fine. I really don't have any faults with the features and the overall quality of the phone, it's great which it should be for being nearly 2k. That's where I get to my criticisms.Downsides:So it's hard for me to to give this a full 5 stars for a couple reasons. For the cost of this device I expect a little more. It's got many features and functions to work with an S pen but somehow does not come with one. Doesn't even come with a holder for one. It doesn't come with a power brick either, not a huge deal for me but for 2k? Even just a screen protector for the front screen would've been nice. Come on. Yes I am being picky and honestly if you are looking at a phone that costs this much you probably don't care to spend a little more on an S pen and case with holder but I just had to put it out there. Another point, as someone who isn't an artist or doesn't power use their phone I don't see myself getting the full use of a giant screen like this. I can see drawing and taking notes, which would be nice with an s pen... but there are videos which do look nice on the big screen.While my large ""downsides"" section seems to make it look like I don't like this phone, in reality I do because it's a great phone. I love that the single main screen is super functional as a regular phone then I can open it up for big screen movies or videos. I can't in good conscious give this phone any lower than a 4 since there are really no issues with the phone itself, just the value and what's included in the box.Overall, this phone isn't for everyone or even for most people I'd say but if you think that it would be a good fit for you then you will not be disappointed. I would definitely recommend this phone to people who could get good use out of a phone like this!",0.9987,0.27107163149350644,0.00019399879392752173,0.01687601779313075,0.0,6.794208e-07,1,0.32669176107162257,-1,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,136,85

"I've been a huge fan of buying 1-to-2-generation old refurbished Samsung flagship phones. This is my second of them and I know some other people who have done it too and it's a great deal. This phone was top-of-the-line about two years ago. It is still a huge upgrade for me, replacing my 4-year-old Galaxy S10e that i obtained similarly back then. Very cheap, I was able to get this one for $235 which is a steal, this is much better than new phones in the same price range.Things I like about this phone: it's relatively small, very fast, the display is super crisp. It's great at getting signal, and wireless networks and bluetooth pairing all work beautifully. I usually talk with a headset but phone calls without a headset are fine. The camera is great quality-wise.Things I dislike about this phone: I would prefer it to be smaller. Phones keep getting bigger. The Galaxy S10e was slightly bigger than I like, and this one got a little bigger AND heavier. It feels bulky in my pocket. Also I don't like the location of the camera, because it tends to make the cases for this phone be very thin near the edge of the phone, which tends to make them break in that spot. And this is a design flaw with the phone, not the case, because the way the phone is made there is an area around the cameras that bumps out in such a way that makes it so you can't make that part of the case thicker. iPhones did a better job of this design, allowing for a slightly thicker piece of case.And the other downside is the bloatware. Samsung is awful for the bloatware. there are some notifications that are very hard to turn off, like the one about ""Find Your Phone"". Samsung is constantly pressuring you to sign into their service, and it makes it very difficult to sign out. Two-factor authentication required to sign out? What a farce. This phone made me very frustrated at the people who designed it.Lastly, the other things I really dislike about this phone, which unfortunately follows industry trends. There is no 3.5mm jack. I used that heavily and I really miss that. It's a big downside because now I can't use corded headsets, which I prefer in part because you don't have to change them. AND this does not have a removable battery.The battery going is usually the reason I have to replace my phone, so lacking a replaceable battery limits the lifetime of the phone. Replacing the battery is affordable if I can do it myself, if I have to drive to a store and pay someone to open the phone up to replace the battery, it's not really worth it. So basically the lack of replaceable battery makes this phone shorter-lived for me...especially since the battery life is perhaps not quite as good as it could be. It's not terrible, but you really do need to turn power saving on from the start. I also recommend charging only to 80% to prolong the life, and then just charging more frequently. This device seems to run a little hot which tends to make batteries wear out fast, so definitely watch that.With these limitations, I think this phone is still a great buy. But it does have some design flaws that unfortunately Samsung has not addressed in their newer phones. The whole industry has been moving in the wrong direction IMHO, planned obsolescence, making their devices non-repairable. I hate it. And because of it I refuse to buy new products. Buying old products like this is my way of protesting the industry.

"I bought this A35 to replace an old Samsung S7 running on Tracfone.  I saw Tracfone sold the same A35 model but they could not activate this unlocked IMEI with a physical SIM that I had to buy or with the eSIM feature.  I gave up and decided I would change carriers and went to Mint Mobile next.  Mint has a somewhat deceiving compatibility check and initially showed it was compatible with their bands.  However, there is a tiny question mark to click on which shows it is not compatible with Mints 5G bands.  I'm not buying a new 5G phone just to have it at 4G so I returned it.What puzzles me is, last year I bought an unlocked US version A54 and it activates and works at 5G on both Tracfone and Mint.  The A35 has the same chipsets as the A54 but doesn't support the common US carrier bands.  I don't think this was a US version but I am not sure.",-0.79,-0.028512396694214872,-0.34526923122639097,0.0815244398487458,0.0,1.5664915e-06,1,-0.011750803082907815,1,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,40,31
"I had bought this phone to upgrade my wife's Android phone.  The hardware is great, especially the camera.  The battery lasts well over a day for her usage.  We don't use the facial recognition or fingerprint reader.When setting up the phone one of the first thing you're asked is to create a Samsung account.  I didn't want to do this, as we've got enough cloud accounts, and didn't want yet another 3rd party gathering information on our lives.  Unfortunately, the only way to automatically migrate your apps from your old phone to new is to use the Samsung Smart Switch app.  This surprised us... our older phones just used Google's cloud and restored beautifully.  I searched online for alternatives, but it appears you need a Samsung cloud account and this Samsung app to easily migrate apps, Samsung's ""skin"" software appears to have disabled the Google app backup/restore feature..  We had to manually install the apps instead.  Annoying, as migrating app data one at a time is tedious.I'd rate this phone 5 stars if it wasn't for the required Samsung cloud to migrate apps.

"I have had this phone for 5 days now and I figured I would review my experience with the phone so far. The phone its self is absolutely amazing. Best display on a smartphone to date, best camera on a smartphone, beefy tech specs, attractive design, etc. All of this should warrant a 5 star review right? Wrong. The battery life on this phone is absolutely terrible. I have done my research and went out of my way to remove bloatware, adjust phone settings to conserve power, every little trick I could find online and still the battery life is not good enough for me to say ""it is a reliable phone"".The sad thing is that I don't think it is Samsung's fault. I think it has more to do with the wireless carrier (in my case Verizon, but I hear same issues exist with AT&T). Basically, I will charge my phone up to 100% (fast charge is great and works as advertised), then I just watch my battery drain even when my phone is inactive laying on my desk top. When I look at the battery statistics, something called ""call standby"" drains the phone battery even when I am not using it. In fact, it is by far the biggest battery drain on the phone even over a 4k super amoled display with full brightness. What the heck is going on Verizon?I looked into it further and saw many other people having the same issue. I noticed that my phone is always sending and receiving information to the Verizon network even when I am not using the phone. What is being sent? Does this have something to do with the NSA? Seriously. Last night I charged my phone to 100% just before bed, I cleared all apps loaded on the RAM just to see how what the battery percentage would be like in the morning and just sitting there on my night stand my phone drained 43% of the battery.Honestly, if this issue is not fixed, I am going to reactivate my old galaxy s5. I never had this issue on my s5.

So I have gotten 3 phones in just one year.. and this phone is the one I got at last.. and battery is still going strong. Find myself in low battery I plug it in and after 20-25 mins it's done.. I have gotten with 40 percent of battery and still happy. Am.a heavy user and just 1 charge and good. With that 40 percent by the time I get home which is 6 hrs later I still have juice..what I dislike is the camera.. it's not bad by any means... But other phones even cheap can automatically focus.. while this phone that was worth 800. Can'tü´§ü´§speakers are nice and loud... Brightness isn't bright when it comes to very harsh sunlight 90+ in the heat in Florida. Not even medium brightness helps very dim. And full brightness it's ok but not as bright as let's say the iPhone 15. Reason I know a family has it not sure able the model. But it's brighter and actually can see the screen better from the brightness. But another thing I really love is the connection with devices... One car I owe refuses to lower the volume by phone. While this one at times it works and can lower and bump up the music.. finger print is a 6-10. Hyped up ... Maybe I haven't used it correctly. But use a screen protector and doesn't seem to scan. Had a privacy screen very thin. And it isn't your normal screen protector your thinking of. It's like wobbly flimsy. And wasn't able to scan. And it's hard to find screen protector with this phone.. and seriously don't waste your money.. if you want this phone go for the 12 plus. I was 1 month or weeks before the new one came outüò≠üò≠üò≠üòÇ but do I think its horrible no.. it does what it needs to do for heavy users . Never have I came across any bugs.. or virus. Am very impressed on how I use it and I have proof.. still 100 percent . And one million dollar tip... USE ORIGINAL CHARGING CABLE. No matter what it is. iPhone android.. you welcome. And yes I love the color of this phone. People have asked what it is and like how it looks. Multiple tasking is also great like that alot. And the cable and brick it came with is legit. It is the biggest reason I even wanted the phone.

"I'm own a Galaxy S5 and I too was skeptical when the Galaxy S6 was announced due to the sealed in battery and non expandable memory. Then I realized that while I owned the Galaxy S5 for a full year, I never even once replaced its battery. I also realized that I was only using 30 GB out of the 64 GB micro SD card I have had on my S5 for a year. Those two facts made the non replaceable battery and non expandable memory non issues for me.Now let's talk about the Galaxy S6.I was never bothered by the use of plastic on the previous models, but the new design lines are beautiful. The phone is a work of art. It feels lighter and thinner than the S5. The screen is the most beautiful on a smartphone. The new fingerprint sensor is a lot better and makes unlocking your phone much much faster and accurate. The speaker is louder than the GS5 and I like the fact that it's placed on the bottom right. I also like how the power button is now lower on the right side and that the volume rockers are two separate buttons. I haven't taken that many pictures with the rear camera, but it's a lot snappier and pictures are better than on the GS5. I love how much faster the camera starts and love that I can double tap the home button to launch the camera. . The front facing camera is amazing. No more bad selfies. I also like the fact that you can take a picture by touching the heart rate sensor. The whole phone is a lot faster and data transfer rates are also faster. Touchwiz is lighter and cleaner and Lollipop is a beautiful, fluid OS. Another great feature is fast charging. I was able to go from 0 to 100% battery in just a little over an hour. Who needs removable battery when you can recharge that quickly? The screen is so sharp, WOW!Anyway, this phone is a beast.

There are so many advancements I'll touch on just a few given I'm still learning a great deal about this phone.I have been using a Galaxy S22 for the past 2 years and have loved the size and features, particularly the excellent cameras. The Flip 6 unfolded is longer with a 6.7"" screen, and just a smidge wider. If you look really hard at the screen from the side, you can see a very slight bump where the crease is when folded open. However once something is on the screen, I do not notice it at all. The display is truly beautiful. The resolution of 425 ppi makes for a very sharp image on screen. Super easy to read text. The colors on the screen really pop. Given the longer aspect, watching a movie on the screen does not get much bigger than my S22 since the aspect is a wider format. Perhaps cinematic movies will make use of the full display. Speaking of displays, there is a half sized display on the back of the phone (front of the phone when folded closed). Clarity on this smaller screen is excellent as well. It seems to have full functionality as the inside screen. You will want a protective screen cover for this outer screen since it is likely to get scratched otherwise. That includes getting protection for the 2 protuding lenses as well. Note that no screen cover can go on the folded screen for obvious reasons.For cameras, I have been told many times that the color of the photos I have taken with my S22 is better than nearly all others. So I did a comparison with my new Flip 6. Since the resolution on the main camera is 50 MP, the sharpness and detail of the pictures is incredible. The colors are slightly different, but I found it to be slightly more realistic than my S22. You can also set some enhancement defaults to help bring out the best in your photos right from the start.I won't bother to talk about the transition of one phone to another as that is not unique to this phone. It was however quite seamless as I anticipated.The phone came with zero charge on it. I charged it with a super fast charger and it was impressive. Within 15 to 20 minutes, it has gone from 0 to 60 percent. (Sounds like car stats).So far I am liking this phone a great deal. Currently there is a fantastic deal on Amazon so don't wait long.",0.9959,0.25723079004329,0.0007302885428034367,0.04679508486924833,1.0,0.86287093,1,0.5947895850115297,1,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,121,69

"This is my fourth Samsung phone. This year, I experimented with AT&T prepaid, which offered me a free refurbished ZTE...the prepaid option itself has saved us hundreds of dollars, but the ZTE is absolute garbage. Slow, terrible photos, and it couldn't read my SD card. I was desperate to get back to a Samsung, but I'm on a very tight budget, so the  S9 is simply not an option. All I had to do was insert my SIM and it worked perfectly. I really missed Samsung, and I don't need all the fancy features of some of the newer models. I use my phone to track down the bus, listen to music, and keep track of emails. With Samsung, you don't need the latest and greatest to do the basics efficiently. Within half an hour of turning this on, I downloaded about 6 GB worth of music and apps, ran updates, all at the speed you can expect from Samsung. I purchased this specifically from Amazon Warehouse because they've always got great deals.Now, I completely overlooked the fact that THIS is the model that Samsung chose to forego the Micro SD card. I was really disappointed and considered returning the phone, but I'll keep it.

"I am an android phone user and have been using Samsung galaxy phones for the past decade. I started off with the Galaxy S3 moving to Galaxy S6, the Galaxy S8 Active ( my favorite so far) to the Galaxy Xcover Pro. I had to replace my S8 Active with a Xcover pro, because the S8 phone would not charge anymore in any way, and the Xcover pro was the closest match, even though it doesn't come close to the Galaxy S8 Active. Don't even know why Samsung has discontinued it.I purchased my Galaxy pro around a month ago on Amazon, which provided a 30 day return policy, however around 3 weeks ago, I started experiencing problems with my phone screen, the phone started restarting on its own, and I started seeing some white lines on my screen. Did not give it too much attention as I was very busy at work, and did not have any time to attend this issue.A couple days ago, the screen colors started fading, and the screen started acting up even more, tried calling samsung customer service yesterday but the hold times were over 2 hours, ended up giving up. This morning, I woke up to find the screen almost 90% faded, and the touch keys were not working, I was unable to use the phone at this point.I decided to take the phone to the nearest samsung electronics service center in Maywood NJ. The manager over there was very friendly, accepted to service the phone even though I had no appointment. Once I showed her the model, she told me that she wasnt sure if this model was serviced at this location, but still showed it to the Tech which then confirmed that there are no spare part available for this phone. I was then given the option to ship the phone to samsung and get it fixed under warranty, which would leave me without a phone for 7 business days!!! and that was my only option since I have no other phone to use ( Galaxy S8 wont charge). I refused and was then advised to call 1-800-SAMSUNGThis is when it gets even better, the service rep who picked up the phone was making it look like I was making this story up, and was trying to convince me that there was never a screen issue with this phone, and that this is the first time he hears this, I then asked to speak with a supervisor, which told me the same thing and was then transferred to case management. After two hours on the phone and 1 hour driving to get in and back from the service center, case management advised me to call ""U break it we fix it"" which is the Authorised repair facility for Samsung as mentioned by case management. I call their location in Westwood, and guess what?? They do not have any spare parts and I was then referred to the Service Center in Maywood that handles uncommon phones like mine. SO guess what, 3 hours later back to square one, I took a day off to resolve this issue.Bottom line is Samsung customer service is the worst!!! Will be duping this piece of trash in the garbage, and will purchase another phone with any other manufacturer that has an android platform.Thank you SAMSUNG",0.9537,0.09532226562499999,0.211957575833031,-0.02550895481167048,0.0,1.2064345e-06,-1,0.033638870440121496,-1,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Neutral,Negative,148,115
"This is hard to write.  The hardware is top notch!  great screen, super fast, super responsive. Long battery life, quick charging, fits in my wrench pocket on my carpenter pants.  I like that they provided a screen protector even though it wants to peel off.  It is fun for me to smash it back down and work the bubbles out.Now for the bad news.The software sucks.  Sucks, sucks, sucks!  I hate it, it frustrates the hell out of me.I should document all of my gipes but I don't want to waste my time.  Trust me, the software sucks.  Here is the one that gets me the most.Some numbnuts put the fingerprint reader right in the middle of the lower half of the screen.  Fine maybe - I don't know.  But they weren't smart enough to write the software such that you can't activate the button under the fingerprint reader once the screen unlocks.  So... you unlock the screen and unless you remove your finger within the 1 zillionth of a millisecond after unlock but before wake up you also press the button under your finger.  So you open up whatever app (I moved all of my apps away from that area) or you pause your music, or start it or whatever because coincidentally the start/stop button for amazon music is RIGHT THERE!  OMG it makes me so mad to unlock the screen and immediately also pause my music.  yeah yeah I know...  Use face unlock.  I do - but frequently that is less convenient.  I know it seems like a 1st world problem, but I'm telling you it is the tip of the software bug iceberg.  If I wasn't into this POS for $600 I'd throw it way.  Seems like I'm stuck with this until Verizon offers a trade in on anything other than OnePlus.Okay, one more since I brought up face unlock...  The button layout is terrible.  To face unlock you need to press the power button.  Well, the volume button is exactly opposite.  so you squeeze power and almost always also squeeze volume up and do you know what you get?  A screen shot of your lock screen.  Super useful.

"The Samsung Galaxy A35 is a solid mid-range phone that ticks most of the boxes for everyday users. It offers a decent set of features at a reasonable price, making it a tempting option for budget-conscious consumers.What I Liked:Long-lasting battery: The A35 boasts a battery that easily lasts a full day, even with moderate to heavy use.Vibrant display: The AMOLED display delivers vibrant colors and deep blacks, making it a joy to watch videos and browse photos.Reliable performance: While not a powerhouse, the A35 handles everyday tasks smoothly",0.8807,0.16777777777777775,0.0011219564756430461,0.003726025454699553,1.0,0.9353747,1,0.569814348127052,1,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,29,10
"The Good: The Samsung Galaxy S4 has Android 4.2.2, a fantastic camera, a powerful quad-core processor, and software solutions for just about every scenario; including working as a TV/DVR remote. It's comfortable in your hand and has NFC, a user-replaceable battery, and a microSD storage slot. It also has a little larger screen than it's predecessor.The Bad: Its screen is a bit dimmer than competitors' but not too much. You may not even notice it. I found the Galaxy S4's power button turned on at undesirable times. If you were a critic of the GS3's plastic construction, you'll be disappointed with this one as well. Not a game changer for me though.I think it offers a little more give if you drop it. A long list of software features could overwhelm and confuse the inexperienced user.The Ugly: Not a thing ugly about this phone!The bottom line: Its laundry list of features require time and effort to truly master, but the Galaxy S4 is the top choice for anyone looking for a big-screen, do-everything smartphone. Lastly, just in case you're wondering, an S Pen won't work on the GS4 due to the lack of Wacom digitizer, but the C-Pen and other capacitive styli should function perfectly fine.",-0.2707,-0.0003623188405796871,0.07789666069388712,0.006510954745202907,1.0,1.4839536e-06,1,0.25904954007887443,0,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,Positive,Negative,66,26

"Very nice phone with a few caveats. First I am a consumer user not a business enterprise.The phone is fast, very nice screen, quality build with Android 10, no carrier bloatware. The big thing for me is the replaceable battery. Every new smartphone I have had to buy is because the built battery would not hold a charge and was a pain to replace. (I know I have done it myself).Now for some issues with setup.  There is no user manual available.  I went to the Samsung site and not there.  Therefore you have to stumble through by yourself.Inserting the SIM and SD Card.  The phone has SIM 1 and SIM 2.  for Verizon use SIM 1.  The SIM card is installed under the SD Card.  The slots are under the battery.  Turning the phone on is intuitive, push the button on the side.  Turning the phone off is not intuitive, the button does not work.  The off button is on the upper right corner next to the settings button, both visible after swiping down.  Transferring data and apps from your old phone is a snap, follow the prompts.Since this a Global phone when you turn it on it automatically selects the best carrier, GMS or CDMA.  What this means when you turn it on the first time it will connect but maybe not to Verizon.  Here is what you have to do.Go to:SettingsConnectionsMobile NetworkNetwork ModeManualNetwork OperatorsChoose VerizonNow you are all set and on the Verizon network. If you try to activate on line with the EMIE it tells you it is invalid however the phone is on the network and works fine.  I called Verizon and the only reason this happens is that the global phone is not yet in their EMIE database yet it will work fine (Verizon sells the same phone with a slightly different sub-model number).  The only thing you will notice is that on line under ""My Devices""  you will see your phone number but no picture or model of your phone.Some have questioned say that the phone does not support WIFI calling, it does in fact support WIFI calling, to activate you have to enter emergency contact information.  I know this correct because I have it set up for WI-FI calling.

"Have had this phone for a about a month now. Works great and takes perfectly fine photos, BTW (better than what I had from Samsung four years ago). It's truly rugged, and has a snappy response to the apps and functions. The mono-speaker is just fine as a speakerphone, too, almost too loud for my 70-year-old ears. Battery requires just one charge in the early morning and keeps going all day (YouTube vids, music, exercise app, timer, weather, solitaire/checkers/chess... and all the other power-hungry apps I use), especially with the Android 10 features helping to monitor and manage power usage. Will order a replacement battery when they are available in the U.S., which means I can keep my phone running in tip-top shape for years! Thank, you Samsung for bringing back the replaceable battery, on this phone at least! Is it the ultimate smartphone in 2020?

"I bought this to finally replace my hand-me-down Samsung Galaxy S6 Active that was well beyond it's useful lifespan. This is by far the best phone I've ever owned. The battery life is phenomenal.

The phone arrived early.  When I took it to Verizon to activate it they said they couldn't and I had to return the phone.

"I have not had a problem with the phone.  First week with it, the only thing I can stress is remember the R when purchasing accessories.  I don't recall if I picked the case due to it being suggested or if I found a case separately.  What I can say is the case I have doesn't cover the cameras as well as it would, and the power button doesn't sit well in the fitting on the case.  I reviewed my orders and saw the case was for a OnePlus 12 and not a OnePlus 12R.  That being said, it was probably my fault and I ordered a new 12R case and will eat the loss on the first case.  Not a big deal.  Battery drains significantly faster than my previous phone, but it was a powerhouse (Ulefone Power Armor 18T), so my basis for comparison is quite a bit larger/longer lasting.

"Edit (7/30/2023): This will be the last update I write about the S20 FE, as I plan on getting a new phone in the near future.After 3 years with this phone, I can't say my feelings have changed very much. The only reason I'm writing this is to warn anyone thinking about getting this as a budget phone at some point in the future. The glue holding the back panel has loosened to the point where it is lifting off the phone. There is no bulging battery, as far as I can tell. The cheap glue that they used to put the S20 FE together just isn't holding together anymore. They tout having software/security updates for however many years, but what good is that if the phone falls apart before you get to that point?To anyone reading this in the future: no, this phone isn't worth $499 (the price amazon has it as I'm writing this) new in 2023. The chip is still okay and it has that precious SD slot that phone manufacturers don't want to include nowadays so people buy the expensive, higher storage models. If you really, really want one to use as a budget phone, look for a refurbished one. I've found ones being sold for under $150. Who knows? Maybe the phone refurbishers used better glue to put the phone back together.I haven't decided which phone to get next. All I know is that it won't be a Samsung._________________________________Edit (8/18/2021): I've dropped my rating from 4 stars to 3 stars.It's been a little less than a year, and the issues mentioned below have started to affect daily use in a way that turns this from a great phone to an okay phone not worth your time. Okay, maybe not daily use, per se. But enough that it's starting to effect my initial thoughts on it.The amount of times this phone has turned on in my pocket because of ghost touches is insane. Every time I take it out of my pocket, it's opened a random app and input a few letters on the keyboard. And this is after adjusting the settings to stop these sorts of things. I turned off double tap to turn on (despite wanting that feature) and turned on accidental touch protection (which did absolutely nothing). I even made it so that the phone needed face recognition or a fingerprint to unlock every time I close it. But it just keeps happening. No software update really fixed the screen, as suspected. This is a pure hardware mess up.Here's the cold, honest truth: the screen on the S20 FE is terrible. Worse than my old S7. Worse than even a budget android phone's screen. It's beyond comprehension. The virtual proximity sensor is also worthless. I almost want to give it the classic ""angry Amazon customer 1-star"" review, but I'll refrain. There's still good here with the chip, customizability, and great battery life, but that stuff can only get you so far.Here's my advice: don't bother with this phone. You can get a midrange smartphone for the same (or even a lower) price, with better specs. It's still not the worst thing out there and I'm not tossing it in the trash just yet, but it's definitely the last Samsung product I'll be buying. So disappointing, but I couldn't keep this review a 4-star in good conscience._________________________________I decided on the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE for my smartphone upgrade for a lot of reasons. One, and most obviously, was the price. At $599 ( the price on Amazon when I purchased it), it was an unbeatable deal. Another was the specs: Snapdragon 865 and 6gb of RAM was perfect for my needs. My old Galaxy S7 looked practically primitive when set against the S20 FE. And so, I decided to give a midrange phone a try.At first glance, the S20 FE seemed too good to be true. The screen, while not 4K, still looks great with the 120Hz refresh rate enabled. The rear cameras look incredibly good, nice and crisp. I've done everything from web browsing and gaming to word processing and photography, all with minimal issue. Battery life is solid, but not the best in the market right now. You'll still be able to get a couple of days out of the S20 FE on 120Hz. Also, you can't beat the customizability of Android. With the option to install launchers/widgets plus a wealth of storage (and SD card support), you get a lot of choice with the S20 FE. The size, while much larger than I was used to, still fits in the hand really well. I would recommend getting a case and screen protector for this one though, as I have seen people shatter the screen with a single drop.But, if you've been reading up on the S20 FE at all, then you know that there are problems. First off, the virtual proximity sensor on the phone is spotty at best. Testing it out myself, I had to be right on top of the sensor for it to detect my face. And for phone calls, that means a few more accidental muted/ended calls than usual. The face recognition and fingerprint scanner are also not great. I'd say it works about 85% of the time, but when it doesn't, do you ever feel it. Adding on, the front-facing camera is pretty lackluster. Not bad, but it's not flagship levels by any stretch. You'll need to be in absolutely optimal lighting to get a decent picture out of it. So if you're looking for a phone to take selfies indoors with, I'd look elsewhere.From what I've seen, the standout complaint with the S20 FE is the touchscreen. And yes, my phone (ordered in early November) has the issue too. Pretty horrendous ghosting when testing it in the touchscreen test app. There's undeniably a hardware issue with the S20 FE. There have been updates since the phone released, but none have fixed it entirely; merely a band-aid on a bloody gash. The real question is: does it affect everyday use? Will you notice it every moment you use the S20 FE? The answer to both is no, at least for me. While I'm sure it does affect certain tasks (most notably those that involve fast touches or 3+ fingers), I really haven't noticed it in actual use. Pinching/zooming with your fingers close together will cause the screen to jitter, but that's about all I've seen. If that worries you enough to pass on the S20 FE, I don't blame you.It really is a shame that I can't give the S20 FE a perfect 5 stars, because it does deserve it in some aspects. But with these hardware issues, there's always the worry that time will make them worse. It's a genuine worry, I get that. But even with the problems, the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE is a pretty great phone. It really does feel like a flagship phone, but with a massive price cut and a few downgrades. Only time will tell if the problems the phone has will get worse, but for right now, I'm more than happy with it.",0.9968,0.13197688240721023,0.18211956555565845,0.02014572023779948,1.0,1.7970807e-06,1,0.4758634236116239,1,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,Positive,Neutral,341,206

"I've been using touchscreen phones about as long as anyone else. Many years. This screen is a little weird. Sometimes it won't track my finger completely, when I'm scrolling text. It's really disconcerting.The fingerprint reader doesn't work as well as older Samsung phones where it was on the back of the phone. Those worked almost always... maybe once every couple days it would need a second read.This one, probably 10-20 times per day it won't read my fingerprint right, and I have to do it a second, third, or fourth time. Occasionally it will even refuse to read so many times in a row I have to draw my pattern to unlock.Final problem: when I'm taking pictures with it, sometimes the camera app will ""freeze"" for 10-15 seconds at a time. It will seem like it's working, but just won't take a picture, no matter how many times I jam that take-a-picture button on the screen.

"I am a longtime samsung user, and I have been very happy with all the various items I've owned, after having the note 10+ for a few years I decided it was time for an upgrade. I had many options available to me but after hearing about the processor this phone has + the amazing camera I decided to take a chance with this. Boy I'm glad I did, setup was a breeze, navigation is simple, the phone feels solid, it's fast and feels great to the touch. I was disappointed that no charger came with it and no option for SD card. However there is plenty of space with the 500+GB. Also I purchased a 45w charger and it works great, charges fast. I will say this, unless you only want the phone for basic use the battery does drain a bit quicker than other samsung phones I've owned. Now onto the camera, as a photographer I am always looking for options other than a bulky camera, so when I heard the camera had up to 100x zoom I was enthralled. The picture quality is amazing but does suffer a bit with longer range zoom. The night view works great for taking pictures in low light environments.

"Some great potential here, but for a $1,000 flagship phone it is a huge disappointment.  Others have summarized the good points so I am going to focus on the bad:1.  Despite false advertising, this phone is not dual SIM in the USA at least.  An update has been promised since April ""next update"" but every update it is the same, no dual SIM.2.  The curved edge is critical to control this phone - scrolling, back and forward, etc.  Very cool and it works great except that it is impossible to hold the phone securely without activating the edge controls.  This means you have to hold the phone in the palm of your hand without touching the sides - not an easy trick and it makes it easy to drop the phone.3.  Because of the edge control issue, cases are poorly made for this phone.  I have tried three including the official OnePlus case, and all have the same issue - the edge protector ridge interferes with the swiping needed for edge control functions.4.  We have a documented issue where messages SMS that messages that are actually sent show up as unsent.  This problem reappears from time to time and OnePlus tech supports only answer is to totally reset the phone from firmware boot ROM (losing all apps and app data).  I just ignore the "" message not sent"" errors now but that is unacceptable in a flagship.4. Battery life is really so so.  I got a lot more life on my Moto z4.  Maybe the issue is the impressive 120hz display which looks amazing.  But battery life is just too short... In heavy use it doesn't last more than 6-7 hours.  Again, not bad for a mid-range but a flagship must do better.",0.9762,0.18196969696969698,0.04827018184191534,0.240170533818171,0.0,1.6115964e-06,1,0.3495160034608858,1,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,79,51

"Purchased this phone for the gorella glass front and back, sd card slot, large battery, 4 OS upgrades and 5 years of security updates, and the duel sim capability. I'm not a gammer and don't want to pay for all that high speed stuff. Needed a basic rugged phone that will last me 5 years or more. I use security system apps, email, text, and internet with some camera use, but no great expectations on the camera. Does everything I need at a price point below what I thought I would pay. Only drawback is the phone is somewhat larger than anticipated and a little heavier. Not a big deal though.

"Does everything I need, call, text, chat, work related apps. The processor is not so powerful so HD videos can be stuttering sometimes.

"Over the first few weeks of buying the Galaxy A15 5G, I became aware my phone would not ring or vibrate when three family members on my Favorites list called. The phone worked fine with other family members and friends on my Favorite list. All settings were the same. I called my carrier and it was not their problem. I then called Samsung support. I spent 65 minutes trying to translate a heavy East Asian accent. To make matters worse, he shared a room with, I'm guessing, 10 - 25 people. Between the accent and the talking in the background, it was very difficult to understand each other on both ends. I was asked at least four times the reason I was calling. Duh. At the end of our conversation it was left up to me to use the phone and see if the problem was resolved, and if not, to call back. Huh!? The solution? I have to keep both the Do Not Disturb and the Sleep features turned off in order for the phone to ring for those three people!!!

"You think you upgrade these days with the ""faster"" processors. Better cameras. New operating systems but it's all over compensating malware garbage. New phone but a million updates which make is slower and less responsive. Like every phone. It's fast right out the box. After the million updates it gets slower and less responsive. Even if you turn on high performance and I'm not using this phone to play games. I'm using it to get work done. So simple stuff really. Apparently it seems impossible to remove the google home screen news widget on the far left side. All things google don't want to work well. Makes me want to get my 4 year old phone back out just to do basic stuff that works right. Going onto Google maps looking for tow trucks. First location wants to bug out and throw all my settings backwards like metric. Then when I try to view reviews, websites, etc looking for tow trucks it wants to crash. Show me nothing. This is running off home wifi. When I go to phone data it won't work at all. When something is time sensitive like looking up a tow truck for my vehicle sitting on the side of the road I don't need problems. Btw I'm not blaming this phone. One plus is legit. I'm blaming Google and Android snapdragon processor. It just updated to the newest version this morning. 13.1 I believe. They are never going to stop making all this new super fast hardware slow with all this new software malware. So it doesn't matter if you get this phone or a S23 cause it's the same instituted malware filled snapdragon processor and Android operating system and they will continue to max out its hardware with resource consuming software that way its never really an upgrade it's just a constant battle to stay with the times and draining your income.",0.972,0.08367388167388166,-0.4910470970431087,-0.28822588048923237,0.0,2.751161e-06,1,0.18234337932893313,1,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,90,66

"Switched from an iphone 8 plus  to the S23 (vanilla) due to the pricing vs iphone 14($799). Got this at $599 on prime day. Amazon's competitor also had a sale earlier in the year.  It is new, and when i registered with samsung said the warranty is good for a year. That means that this is really a new phone.  It is hard to tell these days which vendor is selling new, and which ones are used (climate pledge friendly...renewed :) .It is impossible to search for NEW .  That means that it is the US version phone (one sim slot, and one esim). I have not verified  esim.The audio through the bose soundlink is a little different from the apple sound. I am tinkering with the synthesizer(hard to find online examples). I cleared up the echo noises, but still need to work on the bass.  There is about a 30gb memory hogged up by samsung setup and bloatware.  Still having glitches with whatsapp history through the smartswitch  cable transfer.The camera is better than the iphone 8plus,  but not sure about it compared to more up to date phones. at 30 x  and a distance of 8 feet away,  the image is less detailed than if you are 3 feet away with normal zoom 1x.

"This phone is absolutely amazing! I have had iPhones for almost 10 years and this phone made me change my mind about iOS. My favorite feature so far is just how big the screen is and its functionality. You can set it up so that you are running three apps at the same time so you won't miss any action. While I love leaving it unfolded and using it that way, I am loving the front screen more and more. Glide texting is super smooth and the screen quality is unreal.

I was able to connect my Galaxy watch with no problems and they're working very well together.Setting the phone up was as easy as installing my SIM card.

( hold power button and volume Button at the same time) I worked with the Samsung tech support and they remotely went thru the phone did a factory reset and down loaded all the updates.

It will work only from certain angles, within a narrow band of skin moisture level (not too moist, not too dry), and with the button freshly wiped off. If you just washed your hands, too bad. My Lg V20 from 2016 didn't have this problem, but anti-consumer practices are one of the only remaining avenues for continued unsustainable ""endless"" profit growth. So, something has to suck. At least it's not coated in glass, made to break, and incapable of producing audio without a blue tooth compression layer for twice the price. It's as good as a Galaxy thing is going to get, and probably the last one with a removable, user replaceable battery, and headphone jack.",0.5694,0.013095238095238111,-0.3294060696179435,0.1493776784925651,0.0,3.087191e-06,1,0.20035284773727846,1,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,53,23

"Pros:-Screen is beautiful, a slightly bigger resolution from the previous generation of phones.  Do I really need to say the 120Hz is absolutely stunning?!-Speakers are LOUD, honestly did not expect the level they produce, they are by no means audiophile but they do a good job.-Responsiveness to touch is next level, I've used Apple's and Samsung's flagships, and I really enjoy the  smoothness of transitions between applications, faster than the competitors I have tried.-Oxygen OS is by far one of my favorites of the phone, it's lightweight and not bogged down by anything.-Games run very smooth!-Battery life is pretty amazing, 4500mah last a LONG timeCons-Some people may be turned off that by default Netflix comes installed on the phone(Though the HDR on it is AMAZING LOOKING)-Transitioning from an Apple or Samsung may leave some software features to desire, possibly UI issues you do not like.

"Just ordered my phone it came super quick at a discount from Amazon. For $635 , the phone is quick the cameras look really cool on the back but I'm not a fan of how clear they look the picture is fuzzy and is always halfway zoomed in. Coming from lg Google phone from 2017 the samsung ui and ecosystem is mediocre at best, it feels really slippery and unfufilling like every app you open is opened on accident like you just slipped into this app. Counter intuitive power off process(its not the same as to power on wtf ). Bixby sucks to say the least, a lot of wireless half baked features that are impractical. But the phone seems reliable enough, I know how to maximize battery life like first changing the wallpaper to a black and white version, limiting 5g/network(I like how you can easily enable 5g if needed, but who really needs that much power?), and of course keeping no apps running in the background, and putting the phone on do not disturb mode so it doesn't vibrate itself to oblivion, which is weird because the phone forces a lot of notifications even after you turn them off or minimize them. I expected a little cleaner software, honestly would have preferred a brand new s9+, but I couldn't find anything that wasn't refurbished. I turned the 120 Hz refresh rate off and boom the battery is lasting a couple days on the regular love 4500 MA battery. I like the glasstic back, but be warned there is a slippery feel to it so go to eBay and grab a quick 10 buck case to be safe. Overall I'm happy with the device. The expandable storage is very nice and I bought another 128 gigs for 30 bucks at target so I have all the memory I need and more! Just wish I could switch to the Google version of software but keep the Samsung hardware, because those pixels are looking weak! Watching the iphone 12 commercial made me shrug and grateful I had this phone, the price, the value, and the vibe of my mint cloud samsung 20 fe is one that is pretty much unmatched! The box is the phone and charger, the speakers sound is a little above average. The fingerprint reader is solid and practical.

"Samsung hit the nail on the head with this one. This phone has everything I need and more. The camera is top notch. I find myself leaving my DSLR at home, unless for special occasions. The screen is super clear even in direct sunlight and collects very few fingerprints (its like sorcery). The screen refresh rate also lends itself well to make the phone feel snappy and smooth. It's honestly heaven in my hands. The fast charging is a must, but fast wireless charging is even better. In glass finger print sensor is fast and accurate, you just have to get used to where it is (way better than face ID. However, the battery life is a little short (for heavy loads), but fast charging more for makes up for it. I considered getting the Ultra, but this phone exceeded my expectations in every way.

"I have to say that at first I was very happy with this phone. Until I found out that the 5MP color filter camera lens is just a placebo. There is a feature that we all pay for as part of this $900 (plus) price tag that we are not getting.One feature, and the only feature that uses this lens is the Photochrom feature. I have come to find that after some public complaints about this photo feature they have disabled it and now the camera lens is just sitting there having no purpose and we are paying for this hardware in the cost of the phone.I certainly will be searching for others that are complaining about this and join in with them in whatever solutions they have come up with. But it is in my best interest to not pay for things I do not receive.I'm sure this feature has an added cost of possibly hundreds of dollars and if we are being denied the use of it we should be compensated by OnePlus for having removed it. They should refund us for the feature and they should reduce the ongoing cost of the phone accordingly.In fact they are still advertising the feature even though it doesn't exist on their web page. In the specifications for this phone it states a 5MP color filter camera lens. It doesn't state a 5MP unused camera lens. It is supposed to be present specifically for the Photochrom photo filter feature that is no longer present.There are other quirks that I can mention about this phone but compared to being charged for things I cannot use is bad enough.Amazon has been very good about everything though. They have been very helpful. The first one I received had an issue where there was no response to touch on the screen and they promptly replaced it for me. Great job Amazon.

"I came from a Galaxy Note 10+ and before that Note 9. This phone has superior hardware and software. I had it for about a month and had zero issues. I do wish it had a stylus like the Note series but its a small sacrifice for a superb product with a very affordable price tag.

"I bought this phone because I am sick and tired of the recent trend of smartphone designs such as the notch, or removing the headphones port. This phone is still quite powerful even at almost 2 years old now, has absolutely brilliant battery (100% SOT estimated at 11 hours, mixed usage estimated at 35 hours), and most importantly, still doesn't have a notch, and still has a headphone port. It's sad that so many phone manufacturers feel the need to follow these trends of thinner phones with no bezel to the detriment of both removing useful features and also making ugly design choices like the notch.One negative I would say is the phone is too thin and slippery. You will need a case.

"Update:I'm still very happy with my purchase of this Samsung phone. Today I was using it to take pictures of ants in my patio area. The picture came out stove crystal clear... And when I zoom in you can see every single details of the ants. I decided to use a picture as part of my review for this phone. Again loving this phone and the pictures are amazing.Loving the feel, look and style.Set-up was easy.  There is a slot for a SIM card (although not required to use cell phone) it made set-up so easy for me. I installed my Cricket SIM card, got it connected the network & WiFi and got it going.  The phone eventually prompted me (asked me)  to switch over the to internal eSIM card which would give me greater functionality and I said yes.  Set-up completed.  I'm definitely enjoying my phone and my daughter loves the stylist.  Also Samsung's costumers service was amazing....during the initial set-up I forgot my Samsung account password - with one phone call and in less than 3 mins  a customer service agent talked me through a simple work around.  Even my husband was impressed with the quick response and time to resolution.I will update my review over time.

"Everything about the device is as you would expect (pretty great) except for one thing...it's bent.Not a big bend mind you, but a very very slight one that even the technician I ended up bringing it to did not see it at first. One area of the screenlooked a little off to me but I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me and pushed through. I noticed the bend( which slightly warped part of the screen) about a week in but ignored it because it could only be seen under certain conditions and because i believed it to be harmless. However within a few weeks I noticed that the touch detection when I'm typing often messes up, especially when I'm using swipe. Not only that but after applying a screen protector the issue becomes very obvious as it's never able to properly adhere to the warped area of the screen. I contacted Amazon about the problem and was told there was nothing that could be done because my complaint  was outside their ""satisfactory window"". Now I'm left with a device with a factory defect that I have to pay out of pocket to fix. Now I understand why my friends refuse to buy certain tech items from Amazon.Other aspects of the phone are pretty great safe for the fingerprint reader which is a bit hit or miss but I'm not sure if it's meant to be that way or just a result of the aforementioned bend.",0.9424,0.07115575396825398,0.014485141086302722,0.08799092859098356,0.0,7.623635e-07,1,0.30229036942986676,1,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,51,45

"In the past, I've really liked most of the OnePlus hardware, so this was a first bad experience with the brand for me.I experienced a lot of bugs and problems right out of the box with the OnePlus 9:  Phone running very hot while totally idle; short battery life; LTE signal half as strong as my OnePlus 6T (and lots of dropouts).I'm an experience software engineer and I spent hours trying to get the updater to work correctly.  It kept failing to download any full or incremental updates, crashing and exhibiting UI bugs.  It eventually managed to pull and install one large OTA update, rebooted.  I expected Android 12 or 13 afterwards, nope, still android 11, but now the phone partially thinks its a Global/EU model, despite the IMEI indicating a US region.It automatically started a new, smaller incremental OTA update, which soft-bricked the phone.  Yay.  I was able to recover it from fastboot, but only by manually flashing an OOS12 image OnePlus support gave me.  After getting it running again, it refused to update anymore, despite being one Android version, 10 months and ~6 incremental updates behind the current version.What happend?  Well, OnePlus has started merging OxygenOS and ColorOS codebases, which has been a bit of a disaster and resulted in a lot of the development community and users losing confidence in the last year or so.One of the most recent incremental OTA updates OnePlus pushed out around month ago bricked thousands of devices.  OnePlus pulled the update down a week or two later, but not after a lot of 9/9pro users suddenly lost access to their devices.  I'd recommend staying away from anything newer than an 8T until OOS is in a better state.",0.7577,0.11408249158249159,-0.14842179350164653,-0.05792578940592108,0.0,7.672986e-07,1,0.23791938228193427,1,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,88,47

"This is the OnePlus 8 pro with the 128GB storage accounting for the lower price. To me it isn't worth the extra money for more storage. To someone else it might be with the money for that upgrade. This is my 4th OnePlus device. Definitely the best. Right off I'm impressed with the 5G signal I get from the T-Mobile network. With just a bar or 2 signal strength it's like full strength 4G. No problem at all sending or receiving pictures with that weak signal.The other thing to mention is how much fun the camera is to play with (if you have time). I've taken a few hours one day to go through different features: slow-mo, time lapse, color filter, panarama, 48 megapixel, and 12 megapixel. If you don't have time to play with settings in camera it will still simply take a great shot.The bigger battery is nice. A normal day for me at work would be that I listen to music on Bluetooth headphones for about 6 hours, normal check or send a few messages, gander through news headlines at lunch and still have over 60% battery at the end of day.The software from OnePlus is really good because it allows you to set different things for your own taste.

"The wifes phone being 4 years old wasn't cutting the mustard to say. Battery was shot so it was time to retire the note 20.  I opted to get her this model.  I own the 12 she didn't want the giantic screen. So the 12r was the same size as her old note.Without me going after a day or two. Actually a whole week, she flat said the battery lasts all day, pictures are 10x better and it charges in like two seconds. And everything is just faster.  She has been super impressed with it.Owning now the 12 (me) and 12r (her). You honestly can't go wrong.If you asked me whats the biggest difference is of the two the 12 camera is far better. BUT the 12R can hold it's own and takes amazing shots. The detail and saturation is wonderfull. She even took some video at our son track meet. Said I can't belive how clear the video is and you can here all the sounds. And on a personal side note here the 12r is superrrr easy when it comes to shots and video recording. Can I tell the speed difference in the two nope they are both just as fast.If this is what the one plus has to offer and these hold up ill stick with one plus phones.And the os system is little different but my wife is not a tech person at all.

"Overall a good phone.5G on T-Mobile only, if even. Not on AT&T.Camera(s) use EIS - image stabilization in software. The issue is that EIS is only in the included camera software. Using other apps to capture pics/videos do not get any image stabilization. E.g. Open Camera and dash-cam apps. This is a step back from my older phones (OnePlus 6, OnePlus 7 Pro).Good wide-lens camera, no optical zoom camera.Battery life is good, especially after Android 13 update. I get two days with moderate use.Battery gets warm during charging - not good for its life. I have to pay attention (use AccuBattery) and disconnect the charger at 80%. The phone has a optimized charging feature, but no way of stopping the charging before 100% and avoiding overheating.

"I like the phone.  It's the 3rd oneplus that I've had.  It's a good phone.  The only two big downsides I had for this phone when comparing to Apple and Samsung is that 1) the facial recognition is pretty poor.  it's just random when it decides to work or not, and if it's dark or anything at all around your face you can pretty much forget it.  2) the camera quality is pretty bad.

"This was a replacement for my beloved 6T that was damaged by some chemical leaking on it. While it certainly has some great new capabilities (especially the camera and 5G) I just don't love it like I did the old one. The wireless connection is a little finicky. Its size and the center camera make it less comfortable to use, and although I guess it's faster than the 6T I find myself waiting for pages to load when I open a new browser. Also, I'm a little worried about the screen. There are a couple of tiny nicks on the rounded edge, you can't see them unless the light is just right and I didn't notice them sliding my fingers up and down until my fingernail snagged one once. I don't know whether they were there when the phone arrived, but it's never been dropped and I don't know what could have caused them.

Toting 5 lenses you'd think it would be amazing, but it's a big let down, at least to me.

I loved my Galaxy S9 Plus and replaced it with S24 Plus.  S24 Plus is lighter with a slightly larger screen and has a lot more features people talk about here.

"My review will not sway most but if you are curious about OnePlus...take the step.  My son convinced me many years ago to try it. I really like the brand but be warned it is hard to go back to slow charging so OnePlus has a real niche. When my 9pro suffered a smashed screen, I went back to my old Samsung s22 while I considered my options.  That S22 helped me decide on OnePlus again.  I rely on phone hotspot and field a lot of calls each day for my job. Even when new my S22 would need some top off.

"Previous phone was a Samsung Galaxy Note 8 that I've had since it came to market. It started having issues and I was actually still looking into the note versions as I love the s-pen. Learned about the s23 ultra and watched many YouTube videos before purchasing. I opted for lavender and the color is gorgeous. I opted for flexpay which made this expense doable. I got used to the expansive size really quickly.ConsI absolutely hate not having a standard headphone jack. Using a dongle socks big time and Bluetooth devices takes planning.My old note volume buttons were on the left and were convenient for thumb navigation. These buttons being on the right are awkward.The pen is now also on the left and is awkward as wellProsRemoved xfinity Sim from the note 8 and put it in the new s23 ultra was a simple maneuver.Battery life is amazing.

"This is the first time I've splurged and bought a genuine Samsung Galaxy. I expected to be delighted, and I was at first. The phone lived up to the hype I'd read in reviews. Bright , colorful screen, good cameras, efficient design. But by the time I finished setting it up, I realized the battery was draining super fast. I can't use the phone for more than 3 or 4 hours before the battery drains. I called Samsung, and a very helpful technician diagnosed by remote control, concluding nothing was wrong in software or settings, suggesting the battery must be defective.That where the helpfulness ended. Neither Samsung nor Amazon will replace the phone. Samsung washes their hands of responsibility short of directing me to a location an hour away where a technician might be able to repair the phone. Of course, repair is unacceptable. I ordered a new, perfect phone, and that's what I deserve to have. There's supposed to be a 14-day replacement policy, according to Samsung, but I have to get that from Amazon. Amazon will not replace the phone, saying only, ""we don't have that option in our system."" They want me to mail it back and have it ""evaluated by a technician"" for possible refund of replacement. Imagine my shock that they won't just send me a new phone.I called Samsung back, and they refuse to help in any way. They aren't even listening to me. I just spent 20 minutes telling a customer care rep the whole story (for the tenth time) and even though I specified repeatedly that I bought the phone from Amazon, he ended the call by telling me one of the reasons he couldn't help me is that he doesn't know from whom I bought the phone. Needless to say, I will never buy another Samsung product. I can also say I'm dismayed and angry that Amazon doesn't have my back. I've spent hours on the phone today trying to have a defective phone replaced, and I've got nothing to show for it, other than a defective phone that won't hold a charge.",0.9399,0.14936868686868696,0.09810314131813103,-0.08939168288860788,0.0,1.265668e-06,1,0.2997116301380225,-1,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,88,74

"This review will mostly be for people with current flagships looking to get into the foldable market, Iphone user for 10 years recently swtiched from a iphone 14 pro max to the Galaxy 23 ultra earlier this year and couldnt have been happier, but ive always had an itch to try out a foldable, so when i seen one plus coming out with one that was more on the normal side of a cover screen and incredible specs i thought id try it out, first impressions, build quality is crazy nice, feels great, lightweight very snappy open and close, and having never used a foldable before, the inner screen is insane, you will never notice the crease and its so hard to feel so major props to one plus for that, mostly everything you see on the youtube reviews is true so ill skip most of that, but the question that stands is it worth swtiching from a flagship, and the answer is no. Cover screen which you'll probably be using at least 60% of the time is just way to small still compared to the s23 ultra or an iphone pro max, software just isnt there yet either very laggy compared to other flagships, lots of apps dont work on the cover screen, but surprisingly work on the inner screen? Also apps that have either face id unlock or biometrics on Samsung and Apple dont exist on the one plus which is VERY frustrating, having to type in a password for an app everytime is annoying it doesnt even let you save it on there regardless if its with biometrics or not, and this isnt all apps its just some, just like some apps not fitting the cover screen or inner, just a few i ran across in my case, while we're on that note though, i will say one plus has the quickest biometrics ever, truly incredible, lastly their software ""phone clone"" sucks its absolutely nothing compared to apples or Samsungs and when switching brands like that it makes it so much easier and more convincing to do so and it was just so annoying swtiching all my stuff and settings over manually, so in conclusion its a great phone, incredible build quality, beautiful screens, amazing cameras, speakers are the best out there, switching from another foldable, probably worth, going from a flagship, probably not. while its a great phone, you're still giving up quite a few things, id love for foldables to be on par with flagships but we're just not there yet.",0.9956,0.16851666666666668,0.00030389166024512304,0.08696708497636485,1.0,2.2484114e-06,1,0.46448427024495664,-1,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,Positive,Neutral,107,72
"I moved over from iphone, and haven't looked back. The folding feature is ACTUALLY useful on a daily basis for either more comfortable use, taking pictures, or multi-tasking. The outside screen is especially nice for photos.No issues with the hinge, 90% of the time I forget the crease is there.I hate how large most phones are, but small phones are difficult to use, so this is a perfect middle ground of being compact but also having a good size screen.I don't have any issues with the durability, but I never drop phones and haven't even broken a screen protector before, so someone with a more haphazard use pattern for their phone will probably be at risk of scratching/damaging the soft inner screen.The facial detection is not great for me, but I have an unusual face so even iphones struggle.

"I really didn't want to get this phone but was forced to by ATT. This is the best se.i-ruggedized phone they will now allow on the network. I had to replace my Doogee 96s pro as it isn't on ATTs approved list even though it technically supported VoLTE completely on the network.Problems I have with the Galaxy is that it really doesn't seem to be a ruggedized phone. It has little protection from drops and the removable back cover is super thin and flimsy. There are no covers for the ports. Even though they are internally sealed water can get in them and cause issues. The first thing I had to do was buy a good case and screen protector to make up for some of these shortcomings.  Then, the processor isn't the best and it shows some. No huge issues but some things aren't as instantaneous as I'm used to on better ruggedized phones. The ram is sorely lacking and so is internal memory.  For less money my Doigee had a better processor and twice the memory.  This is a huge mistake on Samsung's part in my opinion.The cameras are the minimum I would accept in a smart phone and really lacking compared to other higher end ruggedized phones.  The resolution of both is half of the Doogee and the doogee wide angle is way better. On top of that this phone offers NO dedicated camera like the FAIRS and IR night vision other higher end ruggedized phones add.The one positive is that this does out shine the Kyocera phones ATT offers as ruggedized phones.",0.9864,0.17436540731995276,-0.4160477352951507,0.09283773451082311,0.0,2.2406434e-06,1,0.26250823531129297,1,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,61,53

"I had just about given up on finding a suitable replacement for my dying OnePlus 7 Pro (battery health is 70% and the USB-C port and various radios are acting up) when I finally stumbled onto the 12 series.I first tried the 12R but I hated the camera and, to be honest, I still don't like the point-and-shoot performance of this one vs the 7 Pro with the GCam app, but I love the optical zoom lens and I'll figure out a way to make the rest of the cam cluster work for me. It seems to suffer mostly indoors with the main lens. And there's a weird push toward a lack in depth-of-field in digital imaging sensors or post-processjng (I don't know which) these days that I'm not loving too much. I don't shoot video hardly at all and a 32MP selfie cam just seems like overkill to me but, camera business aside, the phone is like a laptop you can hold and use anywhere with one hand.I'm a OnePlus guy but the last few series just didn't seem worth an upgrade and now this thing is just ridiculously powerful and anything else you can imagine in a phone. It has more customization than I can really force myself to dig into and the basic stuff is easy to get to.I don't care what ColorOS folks say‚ÄîOxygenOS is more than anyone needs. I don't need color notification icons on my lock screen. Give me a break. If I need thousands of wallpapers and stuff to choose from, the Zedge app is free and exhaustive.And I'm not much on style, to be honest, but the backplate on this (green) thing is the most gorgeous device surface I've ever seen. I really didn't think the blue backing on the 7 Pro could be beaten. Fuh-gettaboutit. I wish I could bring myself to use the thing without a case, it's that attractive.This thing (the 512GB/16GB version) has as much storage as my laptop and twice as much RAM. It charges from 0-100% wired (CHARGER INCLUDED IN THE-BOX HERE‚ÄîSAMSUNG, GOOGLE, SONY!) in a half-hour and wireless in an hour AND the charge seems to last forever. Sometimes it seems like it takes an hour or two for the indicator to come down off of 100%. The old, nagging ""Where's the charger?"" feeling is really nice to be over but admittedly not completely banished from my head yet. It honestly feels like I only need to charge it in my car (SUPERVOOC 80w Car Charger only $20 here) for a few minutes a day and never at home. I'm seriously considering turning on the ""charge only to 80%"" battery life saving thingy-ma-bob/feature/setting.The performance is just breathtaking. I honestly don't think I'm going to bother replacing my 6-year-old Dell Inspiron when it finally gives up the ghost. As good a value as it is compared to other brands' flagships, $900 is not what I originally set out to spend on a new phone. No complaints, though. I understand the effects of post-COVID Tech economics and I'll just have to sacrifice somewhere else. Hopefully it'll hold up for another 5 years or so like the 7 Pro did.OnePlus really knocked it out of the park with this one. :)",0.9935,0.1723297792742237,-0.5939418314340552,0.16610355437335,1.0,1.0759959e-06,1,0.39114179688705936,-1,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,Positive,Negative,135,92
"One of the reasons I purchased this was for the 200mp camera. Although zooming in ultra close on a picture still has some jpeg compression artifacts, the overall image quality is great. It also has a raw mode which allows storage of picture files without compression.The other visual features are also impressive, video mode allows you to shoot in a variety of resolutions and frame rates, including up to 8k.Sound quality is impressive for a panel phone, and when watching videos with stereo audio information, the sound is actually reproduced by two speakers, one at the bottom, and the earpiece speaker, which adds more engagement when watching music or other videos.The phone sound quality is great, and is significantly better than most of the other phones I have used in the past.I have had a few minor issues with the face recognition, although if I add more variations (with sunglasses, or hats, etc.) I will probably have fewer issues. The display embedded fingerprint scanner is taking a little getting used to, but maybe re-registering the finger prints may help reduce those issues. The fact that fi get print scanning is possible on the display screen (as opposed to a dedicated scanner on the ba k or side of the phone) is another interesting feature, and is raki g me a little bit to get used to.I have only had older, reconditioned or renewed phones in the past, and have always been at least two to three years  behind the latest technology when purchasing a new phone. My last phone was at least 5 to 6 years since it was released. This is my first brand new, flagship phone, and although a bit pricey (for being an early adopter) I am pleased with the overall performance and features of the device. I am still learning about it, and finding new, neat little features that are not always a big selling point, but add to the 'wow' factor.I am very pleased with this device, and have protected it with an OtterBox defender case and a gel type screen protector, and in the month I have had it, I have enjoyed every aspect of it.",0.9942,0.17226717081368245,0.00120579965699244,0.027885301279078595,1.0,1.5159039e-06,1,0.4565085410933837,-1,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,Positive,Neutral,96,70

First and foremost, it is a PHONE.I am very disappointed. I have always had a Samsung, back when they had the S9! But I am seriously considering an iPhone because this should be an easy fix for Samsung and they will not address it.

"This phone was purchased on December 09, 2015 from Amazon and it was delivered on December 11, 2015.  I chose the 128GB version  because Samsung chose not to give the purchaser the ability to add a micro SD card.Over the years I have had many cell phones. Sony, Casio and Motorola and now my second Samsung.  My first Samsung (S5) was returned within days due to a factory problem.I ordered a Otterbox Commuter case when I purchased my S6 and it works great and is still small enough to fit in my pocket when I go out.Pros:**The phone is a comfortable size for my hand  (2.78 inches, 0.27 inches, 5.65 inches)  and has a good size screen and the resolution is fantastic. Everything looks incredibly sharp and vibrant on this phone.**Easy to use UI that is not very different from any other android phone and very easy to use.**The camera takes the best pictures of any cell phone I have every owned and has some great features if you take pictures constantly you will really like this camera**The availability of the Samsung wireless charger which I have and love.**I use my phone as a hotspot for my tablet all day long and so far have had no problem with the battery running down before the end of the day.Cons:**No SD card slot therefore you can not expand your memory beyond 16GB, 32GB or the 128GB phone you purchased.  If you save a lot of items to your phone you may run out of memory quicker that you think.  Some of us choose NOT to send our personal information to the cloud and would like the ability to save everything to our phone with out having to spend an extra couple of hundred dollars to get the extra memory space.**The battery is not removable.  I like to hold on to my phone as long as possible before purchasing a new one.  The limiting factor seems to be the battery life.  On previous phones I could just go to Amazon and find a new OEM battey for my phone an drop it in but, with this phone that is not a available option.The single biggest CON I have for this phone is that on February 1, 2015 (just 52 days after getting it) my new S6 lost all google services.  No google search, google play store, google apps or any other other items associated with google worked at all.  At the end of three days of researching and numerous phone calls (called my carrier, Google, Samsung)  my S6 was able to be fixed by the third Samsung representative at the local Best Buy.  Just in case this happens to anyone else I will include the steps she had to take to fix my phone.1: Log out of G-Mail.2: Update firmware (the Samsung rep has to do this).3: Go to application manager and clear data for all Google apps.4: Factory reset the phone.After much checking on line and with the forums it seems that according to the forums about fifteen to twenty percent of the Samsung S5 and S6 phone have this problem.  The problem is fixable but, really annoying.One more thing if you have a vehicle with bluetooth make sure to check that your vehicle supports your new phone model.Over all the phone works great and does what it was designed to do.  I'm not sure if I would purchase another Samsung phone or not and only time will tell if it woks great in the long haul or if I go back to Motorola.",0.9893,0.17882969910747692,0.007572328943037054,0.00676390781781766,0.0,1.0091644e-06,1,0.3117809921475341,1,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,165,98

"I bought this phone because after 3 years, my A32 needed daily recharge with moderate use. With this new phone, I barely get through the day. And that with some power saving settings. I probably going to keep this phone because of the hassle of trying something else  but disappointing is an understatement.Two other less important flaws: While the cam makes slightly sharper low light pictures than my A 32 did, don't try to make a pic of moon light landscape, it will have strong red bias.The application screen has only the first word of the app description, other than my old A 32 - what did they think.On the plus side :  Significant increase in memory capacity. Good audio quality both incoming and outgoing, nice sensitive screen. And as with all Samsung phones, you will get several OS updates.Bottom line :  If long battery life is important to you, look for something else.

"I am a nerd. I own almost every foldable and phone out there. This foldable is by far the best phone that I have ever had with the exception that it is not dust protected. That is the only reason that I have it accepting Wi-Fi Hotspot from my daily driver S23 Ultra because I do need something that can withstand the elements. Update: Had to factory reset due to constant random resetting during WiFi calls and other tasks. Also found brick dead twice. After reset, no issues, yet. I'll give it a few more days. Update 2: Even after the factory reset, and a few hopeful days using everything else I like about the phone, it started to randomly reboot. This is a deal breaker. Edit Dec 25: I updated the software; crossing fingers that there's no more random reboots. Last edit: 1 star. When only WiFi is on the phone, no data carrier, loss of WiFi signal, causes phone to sporadically reset/restart, no matter what you're doing, even if on a WiFi meeting.

"Buying Samsung products is not inexpensive. With cell phones, however, one expects quality - especially as pricey as their phones are.My pro: the phone feels sturdy and comfortable in hand.My Cons:  1.  The secondary sim is an e-sim, which is not accommodated by all cell service providers.  2.  Most user choices are removed with this phone and unable to be changed in settings. Example - If you use an eSim with a physical sim, the physical sim settings are primary OVER eSim settings. This is even when the eSim is designated as the primary sim. All eSim settings are treated as secondary.  3.  Google accounts on the phone cannot be selected as primary or secondary. The phone forces the selection on users whether or not you want them that way. Example - I have a personal (for purposes of android) and work based email that each use Google. The physical sim attached to my work email / account is treated as primary OVER my personal account. Well, geez, it's my phone that I spent an enormous amount of money on.  4.  While different ringtones and notification settings are selected for each sim, AGAIN, they settings for the physical sim supersede those for the eSim.  5.  Many apps on your phone will default to the Samsung selected settings are unable to be changed.  6.  Privacy controls are NOT user editable.  Most privacy issues must be waved for use of the phone.There are many more gripes or dislikes about this phone. Bottom line, user control or preferences are removed. Further, if you use this phone to travel, wherein most users may opt to use a physical sim purchased in the respective country of travel, then expect that all settings for that physical sim will override ANY setting used for the eSim, EVEN WHEN the eSim is selected as primary.  NOT OKAY!!Samsung has already removed so many standard features from their phones such as the sd card, earphone jacks, and other things.  This is all done (seemingly) to compete with Apple.  What Samsung hasn't grasped is that Android users are not trying to be Apple users. Users selected or stayed with Android for a reason. Second, while Apple seemingly goes to great lengths to protect users privacy concerns, Samsung causes users to wave them, especially if the user wants to take advantage of their bloatware or apps.  For all these sacrifices, Samsung could have retained two things -  the use of TWO physical sim cards versus an eSim and physical and user control over their data.",0.9246,0.11646341463414635,0.008872345932875447,0.119770202788958,0.0,0.7500917,1,0.4171139478999492,1,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Negative,Positive,Positive,Negative,134,80

"I think Samsung outdid themselves, beautiful phone, got it one day early. the camera is great, the battery life is amazing, unless you are playing or some screen intensive task. The phone CLEARLY lives up to its hype and expectations, it truly goes above and beyond of what the S20+ was... I jumped from an S7 Edge to the S21+ and let me tell you, it was a huge jump, I can feel it with every swipe. I got a Spigen case armor so the phone is a little chunky now but I rather its like that than it breaks on the frs fall. The down sides of the phone: doesnt come with a charger, doesnt come with headphone jack or headphones, doesnt come with MicroSD card slot. All of those features I knew it didnt come with, its part of the market trend.

"I never buy the latest thing. Too expensive.But this was on sale for Prime Day and a very good deal. I was upgrading from a Samsung S10e with a battery that was starting to get really low on charged time and some apps were getting glitchy and kept crashing.Since this was on sale, I decided it was time to upgrade on a four and half year old phone. Saved $180 on Prime Day. Much cheaper than if I bought it from my service provider. I can only compare it to my previous phones but this is a very noticeable improvement in quality and operation.It works well, quicker and a little smoother operating than the S10e. In switching sim card to this phone, there were no glitches for the service provider, Consumer Cellular. I play a lot of games. and the apps are running without crashing anymore and it works well. Battery is solid not great, but a definite upgrade from my previous Samsung. Display is sharper and a bigger screen which means a better viewing experience for my old eyes. Setting up the fingerprint security has improved greatly since I last bought. Much quicker and easier.

I bought it on Amazon because it was $50 cheaper than at the Verizon store. I think I made a huge mistake. Everyone I know that likes this phone bought it through Verizon.

"I think this phone is better than some offerings I've seen and YES this works on some U.S carriers. I tried it on Mint which uses Tmobile and got 315 MBs in Pocatello, Idaho. U.S mobile you can use either Tmobile or Verizon and it worked for me using a sim card. However, if you ask for support in message they will say they don't. I have an activated Verizon-based SIM I use in my Samsung Z-FLIP 4 that I swapped to the 12R to see if it works it does and I get good speeds just not Tmobile speeds so yes it works but you won't have tech support for it not to mention  U.S mobile tech is kinda sketchy anyways. Cricket you can pretty much forget about as they want to sell you proprietary devices as well as the Big Three Verizon, Tmobile, and ATT. I think on the other MVNO's the sim will work without tech support E-sims are out for now.If you go purely by specs and forget about wireless charging it is one of the better phones that has just ok cameras. The one thing I think tech reviewers have ignored but is a major part of a user is ECO-SYSTEM. Gemini makes me scream for Bixby or even Alexa the AI is so biased and untruthful. The messaging sucks.There is no theme store or font, etc. In the photo above you see a copy of a theme from Samsung that it brought over when it copied my phone. This phone has some nice features such as a nice screen I leave it in Vivid mode. Samsung forces you to buy the Ultra to get this type of screen. For me, the fast charging is cool , but seems kind of bull you have to get the 12 at a much higher price to get wireless.

I love the digital processor to take photos.  I wish the night mode photos were a little better but it's not bad.

"I will never, ever even consider buying another one of these garbage can phones ever again. In 6 months it has proven to be the worst phone I've owned in almost 20 years of owning cell phones. And realistically, the hardware is fine, it's the garbage can operating system that truly raises the bar on awfulness. The very first system update from about 5 or 6 months ago rendered the phone unable to connect to any network so I had to factory reset the phone and restore everything from backup, so it was a complete waste of time. After that I've been avoiding any repeat of a system update because I shudder to imagine whatever deleterious effect it will have now. And then today it decided to spontaneously restart and I lost network connections yet again, although the system has not been updated. I can't recommend staying away from this useless garbage enough. I've already told my friends and family to stay away from and avoid One+ like the plague. Now excuse me while I go get a new phone.",-0.7476,-0.06108815426997247,-0.9179871100912561,-0.8296764908719368,0.0,6.274526e-07,-1,-0.5080501611115084,1,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Neutral,Negative,37,38
"Pros:1) powerful / fast2) a good camera3) the selfie cam is better than the S223) swipe music controls for any music app4) customizable swipe controls to open your favorite apps when the screen is off5) ability to sign into WiFi from the tray instead of going to settings every time6) ability to connect to Bluetooth from the tray7) Zen modeCons:1) the camera is lacking for a flagship. The macro lense never takes quite crisp enough pictures. The main cameras zoom is grainy and pixelated. The main cameras video doesn't have good stabilization software2) trying to change media output is a pain compared to other phones, leaving you swiping the tray down twice, clicking a menu, clicking media output, and finally able to change it3) you can't change the shortcuts on the lock screen for some reason4) it is hard to disable the Google feed screen which I personally find useless. You have to disable the entire Google app. This was an issue on the N100 as well.5) after the last system update their ""red cable club"" app, is no longer in the app menu and cannot be uninstalled or disabled, and thus it is requesting updates when I will NEVER use it.6) after the same update, the Shelf (a secondary tray essentially) which was useful at first due to the pedometer and ability to add extra widgets like Wundergrounds weather, suddenly you can't use any custom widgets and the remaining options all suck, so it's an entire tray with one useful app... Aka, as good as useless.7) No MicroSD slot for the sole purpose of trying to force you to pay more for the next level sub-model. This is becoming a common practice, but it remains a BS one. It would be like a new TV not coming with any inputs, to try and force you to buy the higher model that has a built in Xbox console. You upgrade and get the Xbox and streaming apps, but you better hope you never want a blu-ray player or PS2. In this case it makes it a complete pain in the ass to transfer videos and photos or to clean them up on a larger screen, as the cable connection on phones has always been clunky compared to swapping a MicroSD.1+ OxygenOS is a love hate thing.

"After my Pixel 3a got accidentally water logged when my kid's water bottle spilled in the car, I hemmed and hawed a lot over what phone to get.  I loved my pixel but most of the models were currently out of stock and I didn't really want to keep waiting for the new releases, so I did my research and landed on this phone.  So I will do my review relative to the pixel 3a I previously owned:1. The photo quality is comparable to or maybe better than the pixel 3a in my opinion (I'm not really an expert here)- the pictures look crisp and detailed which is important to me as mostly I take my kids pictures with my phone.2.  The battery life of this phone is much better.  It can last me the whole day.  At 10 pm I still have 30% battery and I was on my phone a lot- mostly browsing but did watch a little youtube also.3. Screen size is bigger on this phone- if you are looking to put it in a pocket this may be a bit big.  Since I carry it in my purse I don't mind, and I kind of enjoy the big screen for my youtube habit.  Picture quality when watching video seems superior also.4. Bloatware apps- annoying.  The pixel definitely felt way cleaner out of the gate.  On this phone I had to delete a lot of apps and then disable or hide away in folders others that can't be deleted.  In the end it's not a dealbreaker for me, but it created some pain in the initial setup of the phone.5.  This phone has facial recognition, but it hasn't been working that great for me.  I will probably try to go in and redo it and see if it improves at all.  It would be nice if it worked- but mostly I am using the fingerprint sensor.  I actually preferred the physical fingerprint sensor on the back of the pixel because it worked consistently, and the one built into the screen on this phone seems a bit finnicky.  Overall this one has more ""advanced"" unlock features but I preferred the reliability on the pixel.I know this comparison is only so good because Pixel already has a 4a and soon a 5a, but maybe it will help someone.  Overall I am happy because I got a nice camera, great battery life, and nice video quality on a mid range phone.  The Amazon renewed phone had no defects at all that I could tell.  I don't think the charger with it was original, but it was certainly worth the savings for the renewed price.One more tip- I hated the Samsung keyboard for some reason.  So I downloaded the google Gboard on it which made me much happier.",0.9972,0.24033719548425428,0.12390594788969844,0.07956492271634619,1.0,2.203099e-06,1,0.49157289559847545,1,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,Positive,Neutral,109,78
"I bought a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra U. S. Version unlocked and brand new at the significantly reduced price of $969 when it originally sold for $1200.00.  The current top of the line Samsung phone is the S24 Ultra, but there are minimal differences between the S23 Ultra and the S24 Ultra and the $969 that I paid is $330 less than the $1299 price of a new S24 Ultra.  Even with some S24 Ultras selling on sale for $1149, I still saved $180.  Here are some of the minimal differences between the S23 Ultra and the S24 Ultra.  1-The S24 Ultra has AI capability, but it will be coming in software updates to the S23 Ultra and Samsung plans to start charging for it in the future anyway so It's no big deal.  2-For the S24 Ultra, Samsung dispensed with the curved edges of the display found on the S23 Ultra, leaving a flat front (Samsung claims it has 47% less bezel on the sides). That new screen is also brighter with a maximum of 2,600 nits (the S23 Ultra maxed out at 1,750 nits) and thus easier to see in bright daylight. The S24 Ultra's screen is also made of Corning's newest and toughest material, Gorilla Glass Armor, while the S23 has Corning's Gorilla Glass Victus 2.  3-As for cameras, the S24 Ultra inherits most of its predecessor's lenses and sensors but does use a 50-megapixel 5x optical telephoto camera in place of the 10-megapixel 10x optical camera in the S23 Ultra. While the new camera has a shorter optical length, its higher megapixel count should mean photos taken with it are sharper than those shot with the S23's 10x optical camera.  To get to 10x optical length, the S24 Ultra shoots with its 5x optical camera and crop zooms in.  4-The S24 Ultra is powered by a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, which is faster than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 in the S23 Ultra. Configurations have also been simplified in the new premium phone: you can only get 12GB of RAM and 256GB, 512GB or 1TB of storage (no 8GB RAM option, as there was in the S23 Ultra). The rest of the hardware remains relatively unchanged, although the S24 Ultra should get a minor battery efficiency boost thanks to its newer chipset.  5-Samsung expanded how long it's pledging to support its newest phones. The S24 Ultra comes with Android 14 and will get seven years of Android software and security patches, up from four years in the S23 Ultra (which comes with Android 13). For sustainability, the S24 Ultra has more recycled parts, including cobalt in its battery and rare earth elements in its speakers.  I took all of these minor differences into account and I felt that they weren't worth the $330 difference.  I will look for similar deals on new models that were just replaced with newer models in the future.  I would also advise anyone buying any new cellphone to buy an unlocked U. S. model so you aren't tied to any one cellphone carrier while you are paying off the phone.",0.9812,0.11920339761248852,0.11766375782977401,0.08834244060310192,1.0,0.7076827,1,0.573441760687537,-1,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,171,70

"I'll just begin by saying this is the best device on the planet. Obviously, it's bro is due very soon. However, it will remain at the top of any list this year and beyond. I do not purchase devices based on cameras or camera performance. So, my review pertains to its strength based on its purpose, and performance, as a phone. I understand that may not be a popular position, and it doesn't mean that I won't mention camera functionality. Here's my short. Its display is brilliant. Colors are excellently saturated, and it produces a three dimensional picture. Sometimes, I think it's more entertaining watching videos, and movies, on my devices. I can't say that it's a result of its 120-hertz refresh rate. Honestly, many 60-hertz displays can easily challenge the 8 Pro. I believe that the One Plus engineers are invaluable in this industry. It does have a new motion processor that is fun to use. This is different from the refresh rate. I appreciate it, and I'm not aware of any other phone that exists with that technology. I may be wrong. A few apps support this processing, such as Netflix, Prime and YouTube. It definitely sets itself apart from other devices on the market. Dolby Atmos audio speaker performance is great. I wish that manufacturers would revert back to front firing speakers. Thinking about those Pixel 2XL days. However, stereo separation is great from it's ear and downfiring speakers. Phone performance is great. I have no issues with calls or its 5G performance. I have to say that their Oxygen OS software is a step above stock Droid. Its Snapdragon chip is very good. Gaming is also good with very little video or audio lag. I Iike it's gaming processing. What I mean is it shuts down many other functions while it processes your choice of games. At times, it may get warm when gaming or watching videos. As with any other device, you can take proper steps to allow to cool, or not.Camera and video performance are good to excellent for those of you that appreciate camera capabilities. In my opinion, there aren't many devices on the market that are bad camera performers. Unless, you're a cameraphile, the average consumer will be just fine. If you've never owned a One Plus device, you will be pleasantly surprised with their performance. It's been fun. I highly recommend this device.",0.9967,0.24249098124098117,0.002526997791082952,0.07554224009512112,1.0,3.4561438e-06,1,0.47389481075299195,1,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,Positive,Neutral,110,72

"I am very pleased with my OnePlus 10 Pro.  I was originally trying to decide between it vs a flagship Pixel or iPhone.  I listed out the pros and cons of each.  I was concerned about the Pixel's modem/connectivity issues.  I was concerned about paying a premium to Apple to be part of their proprietary world.  The OnePlus is everything I could ask for.  It is a real powerhouse.  It did take me a bit of effort to customize it to my personal tastes, but now it is exactly the way I prefer.

Literally one of the worst phones I have ever owned. I was promised a phone capable of gaming many hours and all this phone does is over heat after 20 min of gameplay. On top of that it SUDDENTLY stops warp charging and drops data to zero bars after reset. You need to reset it a couple times for your data to start putting in again.

I am absolutely in amazement to this phone and the quality and the features it has along with the color and the price everything I'm so happy that I actually went through with purchasing this cell phone through this company. I was very hesitant after reading the reviews if you're like me you read reviews and you search and you compare before you purchase anything on Amazon but in this case I went ahead and decided to purchase even with the hesitation and I figured I could return if anything were to not workout.So delivery and shipping were fast although they did leave this package in the cold and since I live in Alaska that was not a very smart decision as far as mailing wise so I would suggest the seller to put a signature on cell phones so that they actually have to drop off the merchandise at the door with a signature they never did that in my case I don't know if that was supposed to be like that because it did save delivery signature on it but they never did that in this case so my phone could potentially could have been damaged by being in negative 10¬∞ weather since I live in Alaska and it's the middle of December 2021.However needless to say I knew that it was coming so I waited for the mail and I was able to get it out of the mailbox within an hour of it being delivered so my phone works just fine when I received this phone it was at 13% charged so I just went ahead and I charged the remainder of it while it was off and then when I was at 100% with the charger that came with it then I turned it on for the first time.One of my concerns were that it was not going to be unlocked truly even though a lot of sites or websites or pages stay that they are unlocked cell phones in most cases they are not luckily in this case going through this company with this OnePlus T-Mobile cell it was unlocked because as soon as I answered my SIM card the settings automatically reset and was compatible with my cell phone company that I go through for my telephone service. I believe I go through AT&t but it's GCI so general communications Incorporated so if anybody is wondering it will be compatible and it will work do not lose the silver little key that it comes with because that is how you take your sim card in and out of the phone you put that little key and you press it into the hole and it will eject onto the side of the phone and that is where you place your sim card into.Now the OnePlus 8 have a glass plated backing on it to where it appears to be a pink and yellow color or ombre color to it but it person and in reality when you receive the phone and open it yourself and look at it it's like it's glass it's more of a reflective than it is a solid color or an ombre color.I love it but it was not as it what I thought it would be but I love it even more so I cannot describe the appearance of this phone now I've always used Android cell phones I have never used or purchased a iPhone myself so coming from a Samsung phone or an LG phone or a Nokia phone this is very impressive. The OnePlus 8 has 128 GB I believe it has wireless charging capabilities it has an amazing 90 liquid hurts display screen on this type of cell phone and the capturing image on the photos are immaculate quality. I love that this style and this updated Windows Android 11 operating system has the perfect fingerprint authentication lock screen so that no one can access your phone without having your actual fingerprint pressed onto the phone it works instantaneously there's other phones that I've had before that were never as accurate as getting the correct imprint of my finger but this phone is amazing at this technology nowadays.I've had this phone for up to almost a week and it last me all day long on the charge now this was I believe a refurbished phone it was not a brand new phone at that so lasting all day long with the way I use my phone 24/7 throughout the day is pretty good for me I used to have to charge my phone constantly through the day throughout the day with this I do not I just charged this at night when I'm sleeping and in the morning it's at 100% and by the end of the night when I go to sleep it's at about 20% still. My recommendation is to not purchase a brand new phone go ahead and get the refurbished version if you if you can afford the new phone go for it it's all you but if you're trying to save a little bit go for the refurbished phone that's unlocked I believe this goes works and is compatible with CDMA and GSM technology and also has 5G and lower on this style phone. So everything was validated I'm going to see an update this review as time goes on before my 30 days if anything is to happen I still can return it I have about 3 weeks left on my return policy or I believe it was 90 days policy it might have been I need a check on that but if it's a 30-day window or whether it's a 90-day window on refurbished cell phones I still have that time frame to be able to replace this spell if anything was to happen or the battery does not charge correctly or if I notice anything that's not correct or the amount of money that I purchased this with I should be able to return or get my money fulfilled if it's not my satisfaction or if it's not up to my standards that is what I love about Amazon and I'm very happy with the seller go for it buy one you'll be happy you won't be upset or disappointed I hope this review helps somebody make a decision for a new cell phone with the one plus any version is good with the one plus I'm sure this is my first OnePlus cell phone and I will never buy another Samsung again it is not worth enough to purchase another Samsung for such an over evaluated price compared to the OnePlus which is drastically half the price in reduction to the cell phones this is my opinion and my suggestion stands.

"I bought this phone specifically because of its advertised cameras. But the cameras - all of them - produce fuzzy images that are of much poorer quality than the camera on my old LG V20 produced.

"After software update, no cell service. Did all troubleshooting steps found online, including factory reset and new sim. Now i can't even access my email without two factor authentication.

I bought the Galaxy A54 in January /24 and it has been the best phone I've had so far. I got the purple one and it looks exactly like the photo online.

"Pros:No more space in the hinge between the screens. Less worried about putting the phone in my back pocket now. It can definitely handle more weight on it since it folds completely flat now but I still try to keep my phone in the front pocket. Just helpful to know it can handle more pressure like when it's in my bag.Very bright screen, noticeable brighter than the fold 4 both inside screen and outside as well.Cons:Not much better in terms so hardware. The ultra s23 still has the better camera.There is still the crease you can see, especially from side angle. Works well if you're the only one looking at the inside screen but multiple people makes this an eyesore.Battery life is similar to the Fold 4 so no major improvements there.",0.9437,0.18606770833333333,0.030382298026812693,0.05129279120347233,1.0,1.8798196e-06,1,0.4587778110547444,-1,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,Positive,Neutral,32,16
"Captain's Log: Day 2It's not really day 2, but I'm just going to have to number by entry because I'm not going to go counting days on the calendar.So. I've had this phone since 26 July. It's now 8 August, and I have still not switched my phone number over to this one from my old phone. I want to love it. SO MUCH. I do not love it. That boils down to two reasons: screen size and stylus.The screen is narrower than I want it to be, especially at the price. My old phone (and I do mean OLD) is maybe a couple of millimeters wider, but man do those count when you're trying to read tiny text. I'm using a Note 8, which for those counting is like 12 generations old at this point, and grandma is still kicking - and she's also WELL smaller than a great many of the more current models across a variety of brands. That means that you are very likely going to have a BIGGER size difference to contend with. If you need it to be smaller, this may be your phone. If you don't want to sacrifice screen size, this is most certainly NOT IT for you.I'm coming from a Note, and you will pry that pen from my cold, dead hands. For those who aren't familiar, I mean a pen that lives inside the phone and pops out when you push the end, not another device to keep up with separately. (Google the Note series if you need a visual here.) Yes, I see the logistical issues with the flip situation, and no, I don't care. If they can fold an entire touch screen they can fold a pencil.So my favorite thing about this phone so far is.... drumroll please... updated apps. My elderly phone is not getting updates anymore, so I'm therefore not on the newest version of a great many apps. I cannot tell a lie: NYT games is a big one. The interface is so much better on the newer app and that's 90% of what I use the new phone to do. Would this be true of pretty much any new phone? Yes. Take that as you will.The dip remains annoying but if I were otherwise a fan it would be no big deal. The touch interface is annoying me, but in all fairness that's probably because I'm switching back and forth and therefore the muscle memory is confused all the time.I'm playing with the camera, and the jury is still out in that regard. I like what I like, and what I like most of all is predictability. Anybody who takes a lot of photos or is a serious hobby will tell you the same thing, if they're self-aware enough to realize that this is a fundamental part of photography. If my camera doesn't act the same every single time, then every shot is to some extent a shot in the dark, and I'm not okay with that. The more things a camera does for you, the less predictable it is - generally speaking, I mean. If it always does the exact same things in the exact same ways, that's fine, but this thing is trying to be smart and that means it's like wrestling another living being that has its own Opinions and Goals (which may not align with my own) rather than using a tool over which I have complete control. All that said, though, the end results are GOOD when I'm not trying any funny stuff. Maybe once this being and I manage to learn each other's quirks, we'll be the best of friends. Maybe I'll hurl it off a bridge. Only time will tell. I know that doesn't help you make your decisions right this minute, but unless you're the sort who owns a DSLR and actually manually adjusts settings as a matter of course, I would suspect you'll be fine with this camera. It produces good output without having to fiddle with it.Until next time, y'all.Captain's Log: Day 1It's my plan to play around with the phone, use it, and come back with updates as I have more input. There's no way anybody can sit down and ""review"" a phone or computer or anything like that as far as I'm concerned. I mean, the techie sorts can do the techie things (not me, but my spouse is, so you'll get some of that eventually), but it's still only theoretical until you integrate a new device into your everyday life and usage patterns.Anyway. Day one (well 2 really since I got it yesterday). Barely out of the box. Comes with nothing but a charging cable. No brick. Anybody getting this phone has plenty of places to plug in and/or has a preference for bricks or multiports or whatever, so I'm fine with this. I mean I actually could use a freaking brick but only because I can't currently find any of the three dozen that are someplace in this house. We've got plenty of those Anker multiport situations, though. Oh - it comes with a quick start guide, but I've seen more instructions on the back of frozen french fries, so you'll need access to the Goog or whatever you use to answer your questions. I got my first smart phone many years ago and it came with a literal novel-sized book, so this would have to come with an encyclopedia set and 99% of it would be irrelevant to me anyway, so I'm also fine with this. There's a web site but we all know we're just going to google our questions and start pushing buttons to see what happens.This is narrower than I expected in the hand. I'm not mad about that. The screen interface is WILD. I mean the touch feel - it's different than the glass on my last phone. Jury is out on how I feel about it but preliminary indications are good. The lenses stick out a good bit, and that has me considering some of those little lens protectors.It charges up very quickly, though that will also be a function of your charging setup. I used my own cords and such. Mine are longer and nicer.It's been in use less than 24 hours and already there's a little dip in the screen where it folds. I already do not like this but I'm not sure there's any way around it if you're going to fold a literal screen in half, at least with currently available technology.There's a little guide that comes up automatically when you turn it on for the first time. Next update will address the setup process and probably the camera since I'll probably want to fiddle with that fairly immediately.",0.9978,0.10494873238775676,0.018180483152150373,0.04430638305246126,0.0,8.060383e-07,1,0.30931948637581197,1,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,277,196

"I needed to upgrade to Android 13 for work, and figured my best bet was something slated to go until 14 as well so I picked this out as a fairly cheap option. Since then I have had waves of negative experiences with the software on the phone, and today capped it off with something that defies logic.When first setting the phone up, I was informed my PIN was too weak, and now needed to be 8 digits long. Alright, a bit weird but I can handle it. Then it maxed out at 3 fingerprints instead of my previous phone's 5, which has caused me minor grief because I've found that the fingers I chose to forego, index and thumb on my left hand, I actually used a fair bit more than I realized.Next up was the One+ UI, a disaster of an interface that took me hours to figure out how to bypass in favor of my typical layout. This comes packaged with an obscene amount of bloatware, and there's a hardware-based warranty void if you attempt to root to remove any of those apps, which I will never use and only take up space on the device. Fine, whatever, I'll adapt.Then it decided it wasn't going to connect to my PC with a transfer protocol, choosing only to charge itself from the connection. This was the first major issue with the phone, as I frequently moved files between my PC and previous phone and now am unable to do so directly, making file management a pain. There was one option I had left to work around this, a thumb drive with USB-A on one side and USB-C on the other, so I could connect it to my PC, drop desired files onto it, then connect it to the phone and offload them. A pain, but a workaround for the time being.And then it decided it didn't want to do mobile data after disconnecting from a Wi-Fi signal, requiring a full reboot to register that, yes, I do in fact pay a significant amount extra on my mobile plan for unlimited data and it should be using that. This would reproduce every time I disconnected from a Wi-Fi signal, until finally I opened the developer options and forced it to keep mobile data on even when on Wi-Fi.And then today I noticed the thing that finally bothered me enough to say something. I was transferring an album to the phone and happened to check the notifications pane, and it said it was charging the connected USB device. Let me repeat that: it was CHARGING A FLASH DRIVE. The drive was concerningly warm, and there was no way to disable it as the USB settings were apparently controlled by said flash drive. I checked online for any sort of solution or workaround, and found that this has apparently been the case since at least 2017 and Samsung has done nothing about it. This absurd misunderstanding of basic hardware is so far beyond what any QA should have caught, and if it's been part and parcel of Samsung devices for SEVEN YEARS then I'm done with Samsung's ecosystem. Y'all can keep your bloatware and atrocious programming; see how many customers it wins you.Editing this review on account of new developments; I now have grounds to take off the last pity star I was willing to give. The phone has started refusing to recognize its mobile data as an option every time it connects to Wi-Fi. I went so far as to order a new SIM card to see if that was the issue, but the symptoms have started to recognize on the new card as well. Given that I use this phone for work on the go, this is absolutely unacceptable.

"The phone itself is pretty decent but because it's not a flagship phone it feels cheap and I worry that if I ever drop it, it will break. But my previous phone, S6, was rugged, thin and capable of being dropped without worry. I bought two of these on prime day, one of them had been opened before because there was a sticker removed from the box and there was a very small scratch on the screen. I really don't want to deal with replacing it so I kept it. The phone does not come with a charger! It says it in the description so be sure you buy a USB-C with the right wattage.As far as the bloatware and spyware goes, it comes with a lot of it. You will need to download a program called ""platform tools"" to get rid of it. There are a lot of youtube videos and instructions available on how to use it and what to remove. But if you do this, you will have a quality phone that doesn't do creepy things without your consent. The battery was draining pretty quickly before I did this as well, so you must do this part. This is a requirement for almost any phone you get.I spent 4 days without needing to charge my phone with light use. It was about 30%. So the battery is pretty reasonable. Get a screen protector, USB-C charger with appropriate wattage and if you must, a protective case.

Great phone features. Horrible battery. Has to be charged every 4-5 hours. Samsung made the battery much smaller on the S6 and it can't be swapped out with a fresh one like the S5.

"Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already.",0.993,0.23987351190476186,0.0037592074598353786,-0.06096765117134062,0.0,0.7909568,1,0.42380312334412334,1,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Negative,Positive,Positive,Negative,71,60
"I took extra care of this phone and loved the pictures it took,but the battery wouldn't last all day, it would keep shutting off and then after a few weeks the screen stopped working even though there was no damage or scratches.I had no way to contact or follow up on very important things.",0.8281,0.20400000000000001,-0.33224319955191106,0.17175768420749105,0.0,2.3802124e-06,1,0.267373837838288,-1,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,12,11
"I got my first OP5 directly from the OnePlus website expecting a Nexus/Pixel style experience based on hype and very bad information provided by tech sites like XDA that seem to be more interested in selling (certain) phones than in providing readers with accurate and useful information.The headphone jack on my OP5 was completely unusable after just 3 months--even the slightest phone movement would result in noise.  A month later the rest of my OP5 stopped working as well.  So after 4 months, my brand new OP5 was already little more than a very expensive paperweight.OnePlus customer service is so bad it's almost surreal.  For three days I couldn't get anybody at OnePlus to even acknowledge that their phone had a manufacturer's warranty.  Different customer service people just kept insisting that the 15 day return period had passed so there was nothing they could do for me.  There was an RMA option on the OnePlus website but it never seemed to be working.  On the fourth day, someone finally admitted that there was, in fact, a warranty and I began the OnePlus RMA process.  This resulted in being without the OP5 for 6 weeks.  The authorized warranty repair center in Texas stated that the motherboard, headphone jack, and USB port were all defective on my phone but rather than sending me a new phone they replaced everything.  Unfortunately, when I finally got the phone back I quickly discovered that the repair center hadn't reconnected the screen properly and there were now flickering vertical green lines running through the display.OnePlus customer service had no interest in repairing my phone after I got it back in an unusable state from their repair center so I filed an insurance claim and paid $150 deductible just so I would actually have a working phone.  I was sent a brand new replacement OP5 the next day.  The headphone jack on the replacement OP5 was defective out of the box--any standard headphone plug would immediately fall out of the jack.In 20+ years of owning various phones, the OP5 is the only one I have ever owned that had a defective motherboard, USB port or headphone jack.  I ended up with two brand new OP5 phones with defective headphone jacks after never previously owning any phone in any price range with that problem.OnePlus cut a lot of corners to get flagship specs into a lower cost phone and the end result is a phone that doesn't feel like a flagship or for that matter a $600 phone.  The OP5 feels like cheap Chinese junk.  The hardware specs are definitely impressive but a $150 Samsung J3 has far superior build quality.Then there's Oxygen which is frequently mischaracterized as being very close to stock Android.  It is true that Oxygen doesn't have a heavy-handed skin like Samsung and Xiaomi phones but Oxygen is only superficially similar to stock Android.  Oxygen is filled with so much code that doesn't meet basic Android standards that there are frequent problems with third-party apps (any app not written specifically for Oxygen).  One month an Oxygen update broke third-party camera apps.  This month an Oxygen update reportedly broke custom launchers.  A popular app can stop working properly after a Play Store update or an Oxygen update.  Oxygen requires never-ending bug fixes since it doesn't conform to Android coding standards.  The OnePlus version of Oreo, for instance, contains a lot of Nougat code that shouldn't be there.  When an app from the Play Store thinks you are running Oreo but your phone is actually running a Frankenstein blend of Oreo and Nougat that is inevitably going to lead to problems which is the reason Oxygen receives bug fixes every month.The OP5 was only on the market for 4 months and making a unified ROM with the 5T appears to be impossible so many developers abandoned the OP5 after Nougat.  Much of the development that's left is artificially sustained by OnePlus.  Developers who want a free OP6 maintain development for the OP5.  But if you follow Telegram, Google+, and tech sites you find that most of the developers still supporting the OP5 don't actually use it.  Even the XDA writer who claimed the OP5 was one of his favorite phones ever stopped using his after the 5T and Pixel 2XL came out.  Unfortunately, most of his readers don't have the same luxury.  And even though that XDA writer praised Oxygen as being like stock Android only better (seriously?) when he dusts off his OP5 it's actually running LOS, not Oxygen.  I wonder why that might be?If you plan to use TWRP and stay encrypted consider yourself warned--OnePlus regularly screws up the decryption keys.  TWRP will be working fine then one day it can't decrypt your data.  You can't simply boot back into the system like on other phones because of the way OnePlus implements encryption.  Your only option is to format the data on your phone which wipes everything and then start over from scratch.  OnePlus has screwed up decryption for TWRP users 3 or 4 times since the fall.Another potentially useful tidbit for flashers that tech writers never seem to mention--Oxygen is so heavily modded that a kernel made for Oxygen will not boot up any other type of Android ROM.  That means custom kernel developers need to make two separate kernels--one for OOS based ROMs and another for Android-based ROMs.  Most DEVs don't want the hassle so there are only a few kernels that can be flashed with non-OOS ROMs and only one where the DEV will actually provide support.Then there's spyware.  Last year a programmer found that Oxygen included a secret data collecting program that users were never told about or allowed to opt out of.  It wasn't harvesting the kind of data that Google, Apple, and Microsoft collects.  OnePlus collected enough data to clone your phone.  When caught OnePlus promised to remove the spyware.  They waited until the next monthly update and instead of removing it changed the name of the spyware program so phone owners wouldn't know what to disable.  When caught again OnePlus finally removed the spyware.Then a program was found on OnePlus phones that allowed anyone with physical access to a OnePlus phone to hack it.  OnePlus claimed it was just a Qualcuum diagnostic program that had been left by accident.  There actually was such a program but Qualcuum said the one found on OnePlus phones wasn't theirs.Then an open beta build for the OP3 was found to have a clipboard app that secretly transmitted data to servers in China.  OnePlus claimed it was an accident, denied that it was spyware anyway and instead characterized the data harvesting as a ""feature"" intended for Chinese customers even though OnePlus sells virtually no phones in China.  There's no point because OnePlus phone designs are copied from Oppo which is a huge phone brand in China.The OP5 is definitely a fast phone.  It's not as smooth as a Pixel but not that far off--as long as you are running Oxygen.  Custom ROMs don't run as quickly or smoothly as Oxygen because they are still stuck using OnePlus firmware with its non-standard coding.  Battery life is generally excellent but a background service can start acting up (especially after an Oxygen update) that causes excessive battery drain.  The only remedy is a complete factory reset of the phone and clean install of apps (not from a Google cloud backup).  I had to factory reset my OP5 more times in 5 months than my Nexus 6P and Pixel XL combined over a period of two and a half years.  The OP5 also charges quickly but uses a proprietary technology called Dash Charge that only works with the official OnePlus cable and charger.  Call quality and Bluetooth audio are both inferior to my outdated Nexus 6P.Because of its poor software, the OP5 takes surprisingly lousy pictures despite having impressive camera hardware.  Many OP5 owners were using the ported Google Pixel camera app instead of the stock camera app.  Since the Oreo update, however, the OP5 needs to be rooted to use the Pixel Camera app because bypassing the non-standard OnePlus camera HALs is currently necessary.I would never consider buying another OnePlus phone.  Unless your primary focus is on hardware specs you can definitely find something better.",-0.3437,0.08792783274926133,-0.924123764374749,-0.15349482102785794,1.0,0.8501333,1,0.21667750673917574,1,Negative,Positive,Negative,Negative,Positive,Positive,Positive,Negative,428,249

"I needed to replace my Galaxy A30s international model phone after about 4 years; as one of the budget phones in the Galaxy line, the A30s offered dual sim capability, but I had to buy an international model with no US warranty to get that flexibility. Shame on Samsung US for not offering that phone!The A54 5g phone for the US offers both eSIM and physical SIM capability, so we can travel abroad without have to physically remove our US SIM. We use Consumer Cellular, which resells AT&T (and used to resell T-Mobile). The A54 5g is priced a bit higher than the A30 series, but still far less than the top end domestic offerings. Who needs to pay $1,000 for a phone? Every few years? Really?My wife bought the A54 5g when it was introduced on the Consumer Cellular website; it was a great introductory buy at $300. I bought this for a bit more, and only within the last few months. Still, there isn't a better (my opinion) mid range phone available on the market (well, the US market, at least).We live in an almost dead zone, about 2 miles away in opposite directions from cell towers (and the digital coverage at our house is about 1 bar). Still, this phone makes and receives calls very well; we augment that by using WiFI calling through our Xfinity router. Call coverage is good.I preferred the A30s fingerprint reader, under the screen on the front, compared to on the side of this phone. ALso, unless you autolock the screen within about 5-10 seconds of last use, and happen to toss it into your pocket, you may find that the screen is so sensitive in your pocket that you will inadvertantly open the screen and exercise home screen icons, including the phone. Imagine my surprise when I got a call back from the 9-1-1 operator asking what my emergency was. Oops, pocket dial, my bad. So I've taken to a minimal active screen time and making sure the screen is black before I put the phone in my pocket. Other than that, no issues.

"Being an iPhone user since the beginning of time I have honestly never really used any other type of phone. I needed a second one so I decided to give the Samsung Galaxy a try as I heard good things, saw good reviews and it looked awesome. Wow!  This phone does not disappoint.  Picture is crisp, sound is clear, and camera is tight. I was a little eerie about a split screen but it works perfect. And the size is great for watching movies when traveling. My favorite feature though has to be dual app viewing. I didn‚Äôt realize how much I needed this until I started using it. Overall this is an awesome phone. If you need to step away from the I universe or you want to be a part of both like me, this is a great phone to have.

"Going from a much more traditional approx. $200.00 Android phone to the Samsung Galaxy Flip 6 SHOULD be considered a major upgrade, and I was not disappointed. I was very attracted to the significant uptick in photographic quality and honestly was not thinking in terms of the other features, but mostly those are wining me over too.Up front I'm gonna say this, and I may be in the minority here, but I have absolutely zero idea what the cover screen is for. Literally. I can't fathom why it's there. It offers no additional functionality, and mostly seems to be there to look impressive, but to unlock its full capacity (which apparently CAN be done) you have to jump thru a few hoops via online tutorials, and then what have you got? A tiny little screen on the flip side of a much larger and much better screen. So there... that's my one gripe.So, let's talk about the big screen. It's sizable and bright, it has excellent refresh rate, so it moves relatively seamlessly. Scrolling is effortless, and gameplay (of which I do NOT do much...) seems to work very nicely, without lag. There is a slightly noticeable bump in the center at the fold, but that's endemic to the nature of the beast, and it's something you learn rapidly to not be phased by.  It's ultra-widescreen, so viewing in landscape mode pretty much any movie is enjoyable. Go ahead and put on Lawrence of Arabia, it fits!!! And THAT'S a wiiiide screen movie.Video is also a particular joy here. The camera shoots at 4K (I believe that can be adjusted downward if need be) and offers a good, crisp image. The photos attached to the review of water splashing onto rocks are still-frames from the video. Nearly the equal to my Nikon D3400 camera. Low light video looks pretty sharp as well, with minimal grain and excellent blacks. Oh, and this is kind of a weird thing, the sound recording is surprisingly sharp. I don't recall ever having a phone capable of capturing even remotely decent sound, dooming some videos I'd hope to cherish for a long time.I am enjoying a resurgence in flying R/C vehicles and I can tell you this phone has greatly improved the quality of app-connection for wi-fi based drone apps. Of the seven drones I had that would not work on my previous phone only one has not been greatly improved by switching to the Flip 6.I won't lie, there is one other mini-gripe, and that's the AI photo-to art generator. Impressively awkwardly un-recognizable toon versions of myself are cute, and, let's face it, an upgrade from the source image, but if I posted approximately 80 % of them, I've tried no one would have a clue who it was supposed to be. In a couple of them I came out looking surprisingly like a curly haired Mr. Incredible.I didn't expect to love this guy, but it's really grown on me. I love that it folds up and fits neatly in my shirt pocket, I love that it feels rugged and capable, and I love that it works so well.Oh yeah, it also makes and receives phone calls. This is a seldom-mentioned aspect of the Flip 6.I really do love this new phone, and I expect to use it a great deal in my artistic ventures. and THAT is the best compliment I can give it.",0.9991,0.28152410232461594,0.11966080824540182,0.10289153182182653,1.0,1.643033e-06,1,0.5004540122035475,-1,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,Positive,Neutral,143,112

"This is a great phone.  I had no issues getting it connected to Verizon's network.  I took the phone to a local Verizon store on May 1st 2022 (not a Verizon reseller) and the sales woman who helped me there was great.  I saw other reviewers that said they had issues getting it connected to Verizon's network.  The phone has 2 sim card slots one for CDMA and one for GSM.  You need to make sure the Verizon sim card is in the appropriate sim slot in order to get the phone to connect.  The GSM slot (AT&T's network) was actually easier to get to as it was on top, and we had to try both slots to figure out which one was the correct CDMA slot.

"My iPhoneX died a few days ago due to water damage (I was sanitizing it). I've heard so many positive things about this phone and this company on Youtube. It has this great display, great camera, great battery and the best android OS. I am having issues with all of them!In almost every app, whenever I touched the scream, it would constantly count as a press even if I am just scrolling. Camera is good but cannot compete with the iPhone 11 pro. Battery is decent. With normal usage without playing game, it could last more than a day. If I unplug the charger before sleep, it would drain 10% battery over night. I think my iPhone drops less than 10% over night. An iPhone could achieve this battery life with smaller battery. The OxygenOS is okay but not perfect. I constantly have difficulty with the wifi. It would connect, then disconnect, and use my LTE. Or just drop the wifi completely while the circular is off. If I reconnect, it would sometime still drop off automatically. I tried this with another modem, same issue. The last thing I want to say is the fingerprint scanner. I understand that it requires a strong bright light for this to work under the screen. However, it is very disturbing at night or using this phone in a car at night. It would make you blind for a second. I mean if this phone is priced at $599 or $499, I would be okay with this phone. The iPhone 11 256GB starts at $849.Pros: Charing is fast.

"Coming from a Note 9 that is 5 years old I find that even though it doesn't have wireless charging and an S pen that this is a great replacement for said phone. Although I suppose upgrading from any phone that is 5 years old to one that is less than a year old would probably result in a good experience one does have to make sure to get a phone that will meet your needs. I watched multiple reviews online and read ones as well and decided that I don't really need wireless charging or an S pen for the price one has to pay to get phones with those features. Ordered a set of magnetic adapters for the cable which will make connecting and disconnecting the phone to charge much easier than having to insert it. This should help to over come the ease of wireless charging and wired charging is faster anyway even if not as convenient. The one thing that most reviews failed to mention, and perhaps it is because it has become so common on Samsung phones, is adaptive charging. This ability allows one to pick from 3 different behaviors the phone will have in relation to charging when left on the charger which is significant for over night charging. This is a feature which my old phone did not have. Based on what I researched online the worst thing you can do to shorten your battery life is leave your phone on the charger overnight if it does not have adaptive charging. When I had my note 4 I did not know this and use to leave it on the charger overnight all the time. Although with the Note 4 you could just replace the battery when it went bad by just removing it. I followed the advice of not leaving the phone on the charger overnight with my Note 9 and I guess it must have extended the life of the battery considering it has not swollen in 5 years of use. Even if it does not hold the charge as long as I would like. As far as speed I find this phone to be plenty fast for doing everyday things which is all I really want the phone for besides playing some low end games. The front finger print reader is fast enough for me, coming from a phone with the reader on the back, and has no problem unlocking my banking app as well as the password software I use. I had read that someone else couldn't use the front reader with their banking app so this was of concern for me. Have no problem using it with Mint, which uses T-Mobile towers, simply shut down phone installed sim card and SD card rebooted and was making phone calls in no time.  For me this works great as a replacement for my Note 9 and should get plenty of years of use out of it.",0.9593,0.06783154121863802,0.059658682786724704,0.06019409212182003,1.0,1.1768882e-06,1,0.44956935614505333,1,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,Positive,Negative,116,101
"I've had this phone a day so I obviously haven't had it long enough to give a full, educated review of it. I'm writing this review because I will most likely be returning it.First off, I'm coming from an iPhone SE and you could easily hide that phone inside this one. I knew it was big, but this might be too big.Coming from iPhone where everything is intuitive, I am struggling to do even basic stuff on this phone like see the weather without having to just look it up in a browser. A lot of this stuff is to be expected and I don't knock off points for not knowing the UI. It just feels like it could be a little easier for new Android users to figure things out. The absence of a home button will take a lot of getting used to.The fingerprint scanner works great. So great that I had my wife try to open my phone using her print, which it didn't work. It's just sometimes I can barely touch the scanner and it will open. I think this is great. I haven't set up face recognition as it's a feature I just can't see messing with.I thought that it being an Android phone, using Google apps would be seamless. But I'm having to log into each Gmail account and re-log any time I log out, even though on the computer, I'm logged into all of my Google accounts and can switch between them easily. Same with YouTube. So far, this phone is acting like it's day one every time I want to switch to another account.Battery life has been good so far. It had 50% when it arrived and it's down to 42% after almost 24 hours. But battery life on all new phones is miraculous, though. A year from now, it will struggle to make it 4 hours of heavy use without needed topped up. But topping up isn't something Samsung thought about as you don't even get a charger included. I won't be able to charge this phone until my I order or go buy a charger. I didn't see this when I bought it, so I'm to blame for that ignorance, but when I read it was to cut down on e-waste, I knew that was a load of bull. It's the same reason my wife's Kia didn't come with a spare tire: everything is a-la-cart these days. My old device, packaging, charger and phone case are now waste, but you're concerned about ONLY the charger? I can't reuse my charger. Because Apple has to be a special snowflake and use lightning. Which they are doing away with I believe, so I would have had to buy a new charger even with Apple because everyone is moving to this new format of giving you most of the things you need, but not everything.The phone is good I guess. It looks amazing. You set the resolution between 720, 1080, or 1440 to save on battery. It's snappy and fast. Calls are clear but I was on Wi-Fi at the time so who knows what it sounds like out in the wild. Plenty of customization options ofc. I like that it has a reboot option instead of power off only like the SE had. The problem is, unless I'm doing it wrong, the button combo to power it down, is the same as taking a screenshot. I've taken quite a few needless screenshots while trying to master the timing to get to the power down/reboot option to pop up. Supposedly you can take screenshots by waving your palm across the face, but even after enabling this feature (which is off by default and in your s-pen settings), I haven't been able to make it work even once.I'd say this phone is powerful enough for desktop gaming and probably has a lot of content available for it, but this charger thing that everyone is moving to needs to be pushed back against.Having customers buy a charger from a 3rd party doesn't cut down on waste, it just fattens their profit margin.",0.9946,0.12041593883699142,-0.13354387676375556,0.12867843467418538,0.0,1.0910262e-06,1,0.3014502268248039,1,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,160,151

"I've been using the OnePlus phones for years until they merged with OPPO.  I decided to try the Samsung S23 Ultra.  I was afraid it would be a bloated mess with Bixby and all sorts of Samsung apps.  It turns out that the phone is an amazingingly well engineered device that easily allows you to get rid of most of the Samsung apps.  The phone is light years better in T Mobile 5G performance and speed over the Oneplus 9 Pro.  The S23 hardware is solid.  The audio and video quality is excellent+, the networking is excellent+, the battery is way better than the OP9P, and NONE of my apps have had any problems working, the software is excellent too.  Its as if Android app developers test first on the Samsung phones to make sure they work (Just like Apple test theirs phones and apps)  With the OP9P, I would occasionally have the apps just refuse to work, not sure why.  Even Bluetooth worked perfectly on the S23Ultra.Overall, I am super happy with Samsung and am glad to be back to their phones after a 10 year detour to other brands.",0.9864,0.3603174603174603,0.0005401310862613862,0.02044707704648263,0.0,1.1144786e-06,1,0.3382436832755364,1,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,56,35
"The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 improves upon that of its predecessor. Its refined, sharper, and lighter. The model design is a little bit longer and following the design choice of the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. However there is so things it could improve of on the future. The first thing is the phone isn't the smartest software wise with autocorrect. I am hoping with the next One UI update it receives an adequate update. But the biggest fix for the future would be, the design. Don't get me wrong its absolutely stunning in pink and screen quality however, the body design makes it difficult to hold.

Returned. Bought it thinking that it would surpass the 500 dollar TCL I bought in March. That phone is now 340.00 which is closer to the correct price. Didn't take long for the Samsung to start freezing and become slow to respond. So now I have two phones that kinda suck for a total of 1k. One can't be returned and with price drop means I'd be lucky to get a hundred bucks in resale. So returned this one and will live with flaws of the TCL. Maybe I'm expecting too much for the price. 300 bucks should get a decent phone. So for 200 more than I want to spend freezing and glitches this early is not good news. Haven't tried iphone yet. I really don't need a great camera with a million pixels and 4 different lenses. I have a dslr for photos.

"I originally got a Zflip 5 and liked the compactness and versatility, hence I decided to give the fold a try!Pros:- the beautiful, large screen is perfect for multi-tasking, for example: texting somebody about a vacation destination and taking quick screenshots and sending it right to them on the other side of your screen- The external cameras are an amazing improvement from last year, likely because Samsung tuned their auto-ai-whatever image processing.- the foldable screen makes it it's own stand! YouTube even has a built in mode that turns the bottom half into the video controls!- The springs don't drag it open or close like my flip, so I can stand it at almost any angle!- materials make it feel premium! Samsung put a lot of effort into perfecting the foldable feeeling of quality. I also own an S24 ultra and they feel almost identical in terms of trust I have in the physical design and materials. Extremely well machined!- using the outside screen doesn't feel terrible and cramped as I had expected. It's a lot like when I got my flip and thought it was weirdly tall, but I got used to it.- ecosystem integration is finally to a point I can recommend people get everything Samsung, like the watch, ring, and tablets! Copy and paste works, if I need to open a message on my phone from my watch, I can immediately just open my phone, copy an OTP, etc.Ehhh:- Battery life is middling, it will last you all day, BUT with low-medium use. I am in a job where I use it around 4 hours a day and it struggles to be at even 20% at the end of my day.- Samsung bloatware is Mostly removable, I miss my pixel phones with completely uninstallable to no bloatware. I hate that we have non-uninstallabke bloatware like AR camera or Bixby (Google assistant FTW)Cons:- app support is getting closer to being more widespread but still not where it needs to be, some apps have issues with both the external and internal display ratios, whether it be too skinny to display things, or too wide to display things properly.- front/internal camera is terrible, it is taking a picture through the screen, but it is simply unacceptably bad- Brightness of the screen is not enough for outdoor use. I went to a local restaurant today and noticed I could barely see the screen with extra brightness enabled in overcast weather.Overall 8.5/10TL:DRPhysical design is impeccable, however software support and battery life hold it back from being what Samsung envisions: the perfect compact phone. 8.5/10",0.9758,0.08263888888888889,0.002098889952486971,0.0817056654081949,0.0,1.0295286e-06,1,0.3060349248254476,1,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,111,73

I especially love the fast charging, less than 1 hour it will be fully charged.the fingerprint sensor however is not functioning very well.",0.8768,0.44190476190476197,0.00313463342950393,0.10724843734932898,1.0,0.85789305,1,0.6124258403429349,1,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,10,4
"I switch between iPhones and Android phones from time to time.  I love the easy customization of Android system and seamless synchronization with PC Windows and my Google suite (I am a heavy PC and Google app user).  And my smart home is Google based which works better with Android. But I hate the fact that Android phone/system gets sluggish after a while.  I hate everything about iPhone but I do think iPhone/iOS has better optimization and provides a smoother experience.OnePlus 11 5G is a great Android phone and I have yet to find any main shortcomings. It is slick, fast, powerful and has a lot of features.  It accepts both fingerprint and facial recognition, which is very convenient.  The screen looks amazing. The color is vivid. The camera is top-notch. Since it's Android, it supports all kinds of audio codecs. I am able to listen to music at either LDAC or aptX quality on my bluetooth headphones while iPhone will restrict me to AAC.  I am also a business person who travels often in different parts of the world and needs to switch sim card.  The dual sim card slots make my life a lot easier.  There are several useful features built in the operating system such as split screen, floating screen etc., making working on my phone a lot easier.The fast charging is great. A full charge can last a whole day without any issue. This is amazing considering that I am a heavy phone user. However, I wish it was equipped with wireless charging.  This may be the only shortcoming I found so far.Overall I am very happy with this phone so far.  Great job, OnePlus!  I just hope that OnePlus won't be banned by the US government again one day like what they did to Huawei since OnePlus is also a Chinese company.",0.9963,0.23442460317460315,-0.004189494495441259,0.006837565004157942,1.0,7.9295785e-07,1,0.46191049523445266,1,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,Positive,Neutral,85,58
"Had this phone for nearly a year and it was sticking and giving problems from 2 months in,the screen also glitches and so i decided to monitor it but idk, the screen also crack even doa I had on a tempered glass and since then it made it worst and the glitches got worst as well..the pen also doesn't connect and the phone takes a while to recognise it, noticed this from day 1 however I never use it so it never bothered me but just a side noteNot too sure if my phone was new but I am hoping it was and would continue to monitor it",-0.8753,-0.25272727272727274,-0.563840075210102,0.2160210206376667,0.0,1.3322656e-06,1,-0.0679778564334464,1,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,18,23
"Don't get me wrong, as a low end phone this is great. It has vivid color and high resolution on the camera, but it wasn't a huge leap forward from my LG or Motorola phones from a few years ago. For that reason, I'm not blown away like a lot of other people. It doesn't play 4k resolution video and there's really nothing new about it that's special. I wish I had spent more on something a little better. It works well enough and has all the space I need so I'll probably hold onto it for as long as it works.",0.851,0.11858861726508785,0.023305529381566936,0.08760015644156516,1.0,6.081704e-06,1,0.44007148354177633,-1,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,Positive,Negative,24,19

"I bought this when the battery started going on my old phone.  Overall, I'm pretty happy with it, but I have noticed an issue now and then where if I even hover over the screen, it acts like I pressed down.
