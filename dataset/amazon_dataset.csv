1,OnePlus Nord N30,forest,5,"I bought this phone at the recommendation of a friend who is very happy with theirs. I'm someone who isn't picky about my technology... I just want it to be straightforward, reliable and affordable. I'd honestly just get a flip phone if it wasn't so hard to get by in today's day & age without it being the expectation now that everyone has a smart device, on them at all times.Well... this phone fits the bill and then some! First of all, the battery life is honestly baffling. I'm not joking, I drove 20 minutes with GMaps GPS running and arrived still at 100%. I was so confused, not a single percentage point? I just wanted something that didn't obnoxiously guzzle battery and got so much more! Not sure how long this level of performance will last with the limited knowledge I have on how to maintain it, but sufficed to say this is really amazing so far.As far as everything else goes, I upgrade my phone so infrequently that I really don't know how it compares to what else is out there... even if you showed me ""the specs."" I'm sure it isn't the absolute best around, but what I can tell you is this: the call clarity is great, both handheld and speaker. Bluetooth connects quickly and stays connected. I can have a lot of apps and Internet tabs open and switch between them and not be waiting for stuff to load (don't worry, I clear them when I'm done). Oh and the camera quality is so clear! Long story short, everything that needs to work works, it works well, and it's pretty easy for a less tech savvy person like myself to figure out.The price point is what initially sold me. I paid only $250 for this phone and I feel like it was an excellent value. Most other devices I've seen online average nearly twice that cost, or are a similar/lower price but poor quality. Not sure what you'd get out of the more expensive ones, but I'm more than happy with what I've got here.TL;DR: if you ""just need a phone that works,"" get this one! You won't be disappointed.","May 19, 2024"
2,OnePlus Nord N30,Drew,5,"I have this phone for a few months now and for the price, this is a great phone. I was looking for something that wasn't one of the mainstream brands like Samsung, Apple, etc. I like the features (decent storage, can use external storage, large screen, comes unlocked, good battery life with quick charging, various widgets, so many settings, and more) and the lack of ""bloatware"" that comes with the phone.There are 2 things that I don't like about the phone compared to my last one (Google Pixel 3).1, that I was aware of from other reviews, is the camera is not the best. Sometime you need some really good light for the picture to come out decent, otherwise pictures can be rather dark. I find myself editing them often to brighten them up. That and it lacks the crispness that you can get with phones like the Google Pixel and others. Besides that, it has some cool camera options, like professional mode (which if I learned how to use that I'm sure my images would come out a bit brighter), macro, others, and some of the editing tools are pretty cool.And 2, something that bugs me enough to note it here, is the responsiveness of the screen. I don't think it is an app issue as it has happened with multiple apps, but sometimes while swiping in a direction, it doesn't always respond the way I want it to. For example, I use Spotify very frequently, and it's where I get annoyed at this issue the most. In Spotify, when you are viewing a song you can swipe from right to left to change a song, or swipe down to get out of the song view, taking you back to a menu screen. So many times, it does not register my swipe to the left, instead it registers it as a downswipe, exiting the screen I was on. And like I said, this happens with other apps too, where I'm trying to swipe across, but instead it registers as a downswipe exiting the screen I was on.Other than the 2 issues I have with this phone, it's honestly great for the price. I'm disappointed with the camera sometimes, but that is coming from my previous phone's camera being so crisp and bright, and I also knew about it based on the other reviews I read. And the swiping issue can be annoying, but it is tolerable.Overall decent phone.","July 26, 2024"
3,OnePlus Nord N30,forest,4,"I like that this phone has a good battery life and charges superfast. The display is crisp and clear -- again something I like. The speakers allow me to listen to a lecture while driving if put on my shoulder. The one thing I dislike, and it is probably a part of the OS, is that I cannot delete portions of a message thread; the only option is to delete the entire thread. Also, I am used to a quick and easy way to add contact info to an incoming text. I go round and round trying to figure out how to do this with this OS. This is definitely an improvement to my Samsung and Motorola phones. No real bloatware. The automated ""clean app"" bing from T Mobile did not work despite multiple bings. That's OK just as long as I can do it manually. This is my second Nord OnePlus phone. It won't be my last. I already have the extension tablet with keyboard -- I like that I can ""cast"" my phone to that bigger work/viewing surface -- and I have the Pro2 earbuds. For a brand that I never heard of before seeing them on Mint Mobile, I am pleasantly surprised at the usability. and innovations. Their red cable recharger even speed recharges my Samsung work phone. It's hard not to follow what they are doing...","January 2, 2024"
4,OnePlus Nord N30,Amazon Customer,5,"Short version: I got this for my mom since she had a habit of buying the cheapest Samsung phones and then calling me repeatedly because they had weird issues. This fixed those issues.This phone has a somewhat mediocre camera, a solid processor, plenty of RAM for regular usage, a good screen, lots of storage, and Oxygen OS is a very nice simple android experience for a very comparatively cheap price. the chassis feels kinda cheap but you should stick it in a case anyway so who cares.The only real catch with this is that it only gets one major Android upgrade, period- vs I think the 3-4 upgrades the bigboy OnePlus models get. That's the only issue and it's a notable one depending on what kind of user you are so pay attention to it. The actual phone bits of the phone are all great.","August 10, 2024"
5,OnePlus Nord N30,C Jack,5,"I have a Samsung s22 Ultra. I've been having battery and connectivity issues, not being able to use roaming data, spotty 5G where I should have it, etc. Went from a regular SIM to an ESIM and nothing got better, so I decided to try an inexpensive backup.Got this phone based on reviews. The biggest negative I could find online about it was regarding haptic feedback, which I always turn off because haptics irritate me... so that's a non-issue. There were also a few comments about the OxygenOS, but I use Nova Launcher on all my devices so this is a non-issue.So far so good. Once I received a physical SIM from my phone company, and got it installed... I immediately had excellent connectivity on my network, around town and when traveling.The pluses are the headphone jack, microSD card slot, battery capacity, and of course the price. The package includes a VERY FAST charger, which is amazing. Also, it was very easy to mirror my Samsung to this phone via USB-C to USB-C... only had to install a few particular apps. It runs all the apps as you would expect, like Spotify having connectivity on all your devices. Bluetooth connected perfectly to my vehicle, my Yamaha guitar amp, and laptop another devices for transferring files etc.As for negatives, the camera was a big downgrade from the Samsung, it's nowhere near the quality. And it's a little slower running some apps. I expected both of these things to be the case.Honestly, phones are like guitars. If you're buying an Apple (don't) or a Samsung or a Gibson or a Fender, you're paying a big chunk of money for the name... when there are very excellent options out there that a fraction of the price.I still have my Samsung for concert videos, games, wifi etc. But after a couple of weeks of using the One Plus N30, I've come to the conclusion that if you're spending over $500 on your phone then you're kind of throwing money away.","May 27, 2024"
6,OnePlus Nord N30,Fabricated,5,This is a great phone.  I had a Pixel 5a die(my fault) and thought I would upgrade to a Pixel 8 pro.  The 8 pro was more than twice the cost of this phone and glitchy.  It crashed the OS constantly so I decided to return it and get the N30 delivered the same day.  It's not the most sleek phone and the camera isn't quite the same quality as a flagship phone but I am super happy with it.  A great value and easy set up.  I wasn't sure what Oxygen OS was but it is just android.  Highly recommend for those who aren't trying to spend $1400 on a new iphone.,"August 7, 2024"
7,OnePlus Nord N30,John,3,"I've been following OnePlus 's products since the beginning, just never had an opportunity to get one. It's a fantastic, smooth, and FAST experience. It's a quick phone, yet great battery life. It has massive camera lenses that poke out a little, which I'm not very keen on but they look very cool. Fingerprint scanner is on the right side which is fine, but the scanner is very sensitive. It will often unlock itself by accident just because I simply slid the correct finger over the sensor not-knowingly; not a big deal but present. The display is amazing, clear, bright, and responsive. The UI is also very customizable, it's pretty cool, The phone comes with a pre installed screen protector too. Theres this cool feature the phone has where you can also designate up to 4gb of onboard flash memory to RAM so you effectively have 12gb of RAM which is gnarly, this is the only phone I've seen that can do that.Update and revision: so my unit bent, and it did indeed have a case, a very sturdy one. The phone bent just above the finger-print reader and just before the volume rocker, and bowed it significantly. The screen didn't crack but it was visibly warped. It seems this unit may be fast but it can't handle the simplest of pressure, and I suspect there probably isn't any metal reinforcement on the chassis either; straight plastic and glass. The back panel is also prone to being scratched and scraped by literally anything that's semi hard. Sand, dust, just being slid across a table it seems. Not a big fan of paying almost 350 bucks for a phone that warps in under 8 months. I switched to a Razr flip because at least that's designed to bend.","February 28, 2024"
8,OnePlus Nord N30,John,4,"I'm conflicted even writing this but here goes.... This thing is impressive for the price paid.I am a HUGE Samsung fan. I HATE Apple. I always spend the most money for the newest phone with as much memory as offered. My thought being it will last until the next time I need a phone. It will remain relevant, the tech won't be obsolete, and presumably I'm buying a quality product.That mentality has served me well... Until it didn't. My S22 Ultra is having connectivity problems. We'll it really isn't that old and I owe $700+ on it still. So I was in a tough spot, fixing it means a bill probably North of $300(maybe more) and then I would still owe the money on top of it. I didn't thi k either option was right. Paying it off seemed too expensive. Fixing it seemed silly, and ultimately too expensive.So in the short term I went and found the cheapest phone I could stomach. A Motorola something or other for $150. It had 4G of RAM which caused Microsoft Teams to not even start on my phone. It just instantly crashed. So for awhile I just used that as my Hotspot for my Samsung (which had its drawbacks for sure).That isn't working. Alright I can still return this Motorola. What else for a little more money might be better? A refurb? Nope... Still $300+ in anything I would accept. I read. I researched. I finally come to the One Plus. Lots of nice things are said about the phone and fresh of my recent ""cheap phone"" experience, let's just say I was dubious.It goes on sale for $230. Alright for $230 I'll bite.I got to tell you... For a $230 it's hard to gripe. Is it perfect? NOPE. is it a flagship Samsung phone. NOPE. For $230,I give it some grace. RAM 8G which is so so, it supports virtual RAM up to 16G. Not as good as real RAM but MORE than serviceable. 128G of memory alright that's not great but guess what... It supports an SD card. Boom. Doesn't matter. The OS is largely free of anything I hate. It's functional. Some quirks here and there... But I adjusted pretty darn quick. The quick charge battery may be worth it alone. This thing just amazes me how quickly it charges. Is it good for the batteries longevity? I doubt it. However at $230, I don't really care. I am a POWER USER, a 5,000ma battery is good. Still not good enough for me. I figure I'd need a 10,000ma battery maybe a little more to meet my demands. The fast charge though, it gets lower than I like, blast it with the supercharger, 20 minutes later and I'm back in the game. The finger print scanner, I didn't think that it would be natural or useful where it is on the side. Not true. Dang thing works flawlessly always.True downsides. The camera... It surely isn't a Samsung. Now, I'll give it props, in full light and still photos it's adequate. Not great, but it does the job. In the dark though... Oi oi oi.... Hot garbage. The screen gets bright, it really does, but it needs to be brighter, by... Shoot I don't know: 25-35%. It's manageable though. I honestly think those are my only gripes.Its responsive and plenty fast at running the things I need it to do. I'm kind of shaken up about it because I'm not sure at this point I'll maintain my same theory about phone ownership. At $230 for.... 70% of the goodness let's say, I have a hard time thinking that $1400 for a new phone makes a lot of sense. Bravo One Plus. This is impressive.","December 1, 2023"
9,OnePlus Nord N30,Lucian Burns,5,"First off, I'm not a power user, so I can't speak to processor speed, ability to game, or any of that. 3/4 or more of the time I use it as strictly a phone, I don't even have data or WiFi turned on because I don't need it. This replaced a Moto Stylus that was losing battery capacity and was old enough to not warrant replacing the battery, which isn't easy anymore.Battery life is better than the Stylus when it was new, and that's saying something.  If I'm just around the house, not using mobile data or WiFi, in a couple of days the battery may drop to 80% or so...which is pretty good because I'm in an area with lousy cell coverage, with the phone varying between towers in two different time zones. That's a battery eater, but this phone handles it well. It also seems to connect easier and with a better signal than the Stylus in the same areas. Granted the Stylus is 4g and this is 5g, but at my house there are no 5g signals, so everything here is 4g LTE.Camera? Again I'm not a professional photographer, but the camera seems to be every bit as good as the one on the Stylus, which people rate highly. The pictures I've taken have come out well and I'm happy with the camera.I rate the audio quality, of both the handset and external speaker on phone calls as better than the Stylus. The media audio has a 200% setting that is way overdrive in volume, I have some hearing loss and it's way too loud for me.Changeover was easier than I've ever had. Most of my apps transferred with their settings and passwords, and yesterday when I went to set up Bluetooth for my cheap radio in my old truck, I was shocked to find that somehow it had set up itself.... I had phone functions and BT Audio (aka Sirius) without having to pair and enter numbers. The phone also pops up to tell me about apps running in the background that are wasting battery, and gives the option to optimize them for battery life which is great.All told, I don't have many complaints. The method to power off is not instinctive, but it does prevent accidental turn offs.All in all, if you're a normal person looking for a phone first and internet toy second, I think you'll be happy.","July 30, 2024"
10,OnePlus Nord N30,Drew,5,"I bought this after my dad bought one and I helped him set it up and saw how amazing it performed. My dad returned his to get a new iphone because he wanted to stay with his familiar apple.. So a month later. I bought one, and let me tell ya somethin'. Don't think of it as ""cheap""... This bad boy performs like nothing else.. I don't care about load time for apps or how long it takes to turn on/restart. That's highly irrelevant. Overall use and performance is what matters. This thing is a powerhouse! 8core, 8gb ram... Expandable to 1tb sd card... Yeah. this thing has mass power.. I've used apps known to heat up and over heat phones as my performance test and this thing didn't get warm in the slightest. I also love that you can allocate unused space out of your 128gb to help the ram perform cleaner and more efficiently...I absolutely love this phone.. I love how it feels in the hands. has more freedom to customize than most ""android"" based OS's. you can actually delete apps you don't want and disable ones that don't delete..I'm very happy with this purchase and with its specs. I'm sure itll last years.. unless I break it for some reason.. I'm not the most careful person..","August 19, 2024"
11,OnePlus Nord N30,forest,4,"Bought this for my mom as a gift. She had a Motorola Rev 6 5g for some years. This phone with case is a bit larger than her previous one. Still operates like an android with some subtle differences. The knowledge gap is easy to get caught up on.The display is very nice, the sound is impressive, the camera has many options that will serve it's purpose. Picture quality is nice. I'm not a professional photographer and I'm sure there are better cameras on higher priced devices. The speed and smoothness of the operating specs don't lie. It's exact hat you are paying for and does the job well. What I'm most impressed with is the power supply it comes with. The supplied charger and cord fast charge this phone for. 40% to full in no time at all. From what I've been told, the battery last all of her work shift.","August 28, 2024"
12,OnePlus Nord N30,Drew,4,"I'm happy to get away from the Samsung craziness. The phone is sturdy, battery life is great, the Oxygen o/s needs a little help - for example, I can't do voice input on anything because there is no option on the keyboard to set it - at least on mine.  There are no annoying updates every week. The keyboard itself has larger buttons for my big fingers to input text. The apps are fast.  I would buy this phone again, or the next version when it becomes necessary as I habitually drive over these things with a tractor :)","August 21, 2024"
13,OnePlus Nord N30,Francisco Hernandez,4,"I love the Nord phones, I don't have to spend a lot of money to get great performance,I started with the Nord100, moved to the Nord 200 , when it was time for a new phone,I got the N30 .

18,OnePlus Nord N30,Marc Hanan,5,I have had the IPhones and moved to androids. Then found that there was always some little annoying thing or some thing not up to par w/ last few phones I've purchased. Found the OnePlus N30 5G shortly after it was released in North America.

21,OnePlus Nord N30,forest,5,"I'm not one to go for flagship phones.  I need a phone that will have a good battery-life, decent storage, and can take nice pictures when I want it to for personal use.I've had this phone for a while and have had no issues with it.  No need to reboot it every now and again for no reason.  Face recognition is reliable.  Fingerprint scanner is reliable.  Battery will last 2 days with infrequent usage, and lasts a surprisingly long time if you need to use power saver mode.Phone signal/data seems to be pretty solid compared to other phones (with the same provider).  Wifi is solid.  Bluetooth is solid.Camera takes really nice photos for my personal use.  The night/low light feature is a pleasant function and a lot of the Ai tools are neat.I don't play many games, but some of the ones that I've looked at can be kind of resource heavy and don't seem to be an issue with this phone.Speakers are sufficiently loud and clear.The microphone is surprisingly clear as well, to where I've even used it for recording music.This is a solid all-around phone for someone who just needs a general tool in their pocket.  Many of the features that you want without breaking the bank.  Worth spending a little more for this phone compared to a cheaper budget phone.","May 20, 2024"

26,OnePlus Nord N30,Me me,4,"Pros: the processing system is very good compared to my old phone. I also use it for work for scanning items and it's fast. Always thought Walmart just had a very wonky app but it was my old phone being slow. Speaker is loud so that's cool.Cons: I use straight talk and it was annoying trying to switch phones. Couldn't just plug up my old Sim, had to buy a new one. I keep accidentally taking screenshots when I just want to turn the screen off or restart my phone.  And the phone is very big for my hand.The cons aren't too bad and this phone is worth it if you want a good phone and don't believe in spending a rent payment buying one.

It's fast, it has every feature I can imagine, the pictures turn out great, the screen size is perfect. It has great sound quality built right in. I have zero complaints!The dual SIM card is perfect for those that want an all in one for business and pleasure, and the fact that I can convert memory to ram really puts this thing over the top. 8g of RAM standard is already nuts for a phone and then I can have up to 16g total with conversion. I could literally run a major PC game on this bad boy!","June 24, 2024"
30,OnePlus Nord N30,Ivan Doc Rodriguez,4,"I wanted a phone that no one I knows have. Yes I'm that person! Lol. So I was torn between this and Google Pixel 6/7. Somewhere while doing my research I came across an article that mentionedsomething  negative about the Pixel. Can't remember now what it was, but it persuaded me to go with the OneNord. I love this phone. It's solid but not too heavy. It's fast from switching from apps, tabs, and fast when charging. My only 2 complaints are 1). It seems like my Wi-Fi is constantly disconnecting on it's on and I have to constantly reconnect. Even though it's set to manually reconnect and my Internet works fine. It has to because I work from home. 2). Is that when I hold phone with my shoulder (when I'm cooking), my cheeks hits the buttons which is so annoying. (Yes I have ear buds but I lose them or have to remember where I last saw them). But the screen should lock so that it doesn't do that. Instead I have to manually lock it myself. Not a deal breaker there but the wi- fi disconnecting does have me want to look at my warranty info. If it weren't for that this phone is a keeper for me. I'm an Android woman and I don't need a lot of bells and whistles even though I'm sure this phone can do a lot. I just need to find where I put the manual..lol","December 7, 2023"
31,OnePlus Nord N30,forest,5,"I bought this phone because physically it has features I want but there is also the OS OxygenOS so this is my thoughts on both.I wanted an unlocked phone that works with TracFone. I wanted NFC, minimum of 128gb storage plus the ability to use my micro sd, 5g though 5g was not a deal breaker. As I looked I became aware a 3.5 headphone jack is rarely available on most new phones and I use that daily and it's available on the N30.I had no problems activating the phone and transferring my TracFone service, I used a TracFone sim and the menu available on the TracFone website. The phone functions well everything I was looking for. It does have one physical drawback in my mind and that is the location of the volume keys. The power is on the right and volume on the left and it's easy trying to change the volume to press the power at the same time. In OxygenOS the power button and volume down key activate the power menu to restart or power off and it's easy to press both unintentionally. The battery I'm happy with only charging once a day with the supplied charging block and cable. It will quick charge in about 20 minutes. Overall I am please with the device. The sound is wonderful, the camera good but the interface is different then I previously had. I work from home and use wifi calling without an issue.The OxygenOS is the other part, I have adjusted to most of the differences but it's not what I view as my OS of choice. An example the phone would go to sleep while I was looking at it, I looked for a setting to keep focus while I was looking at the screen but for the life of me I couldn't find an obvious named setting. I continued looking and I have changed so focus stays on but trying so many things I can't tell you which setting changed it. I use Niagra launcher and it makes a change in OS less dramatic. There are two apps I have been unable to uninstall, “Red Cable Club” and the “OneplusClock” I prefer the Google clock I’ve been using for years.I would buy this phone again, it has all the features I was looking for and some of those are being eliminated in new phones.","October 12, 2023"
32,OnePlus Nord N30,Drew,5,"I bought this phone as a cheaper replacement for a Samsung device that succumbed to wear and tear as I use my phone to play video games competitively at a high level. Despite being about 400 dollars cheaper than my Samsung purchase, this phone has been better in every regard. It's faster, easier to use, and doesn't get hot easily when running games on high settings. The biometric features have also been more consistent and functional than my previous phone. If you're someone that values solid performance and a convenient, easy to use interface, I recommend this phone 100%. Charges incredibly fast too. I've had it for 6 months now and it is essentially in the same condition it arrived in, and I hope to see it continue to last.Note: Gaming is primarily all I use this device for, so I cannot attest to it's capacity for more demanding endeavors.","June 6, 2024"
33,OnePlus Nord N30,D Johnson,4,"Don't get me wrong, as a low end phone this is great. It has vivid color and high resolution on the camera, but it wasn't a huge leap forward from my LG or Motorola phones from a few years ago. For that reason, I'm not blown away like a lot of other people. It doesn't play 4k resolution video and there's really nothing new about it that's special. I wish I had spent more on something a little better. It works well enough and has all the space I need so I'll probably hold onto it for as long as it works.","April 28, 2024"
34,OnePlus Nord N30,Joseph,5,"Update:I no longer close myself out of apps (except just now, bc this phone has a twisted sense of humor). Like any new setup, it just took a little getting used to. For example, I added a screen protector, not realizing it came with one already on it. I don't expect to upgrade for quite a while, but when I do, I probably won't even bother looking at other brands. OnePlus is the way to go - the Nord n30 feels and acts like a much more expensive device than it is.Original:I had never heard of the OnePlus brand until recently, but they seem to have a very good reputation. The Nord n30 kept topping the list of best lower-cost phones, so I took a chance and I'm so glad. My old phone was glitching a lot, basically acting like it was on the verge of total failure. I wanted to get something of reasonable quality, and fortunately, Amazon lets you pay in installments with no interest. That makes a big difference when money is tight, and at the holidays in particular.It's thin and light, and the screen is about as big as it can get without being ridiculous. That's perfect if you're 40+ and don't see as well anymore. The downside is that if you happen to have small hands, it may take some getting used to - it's just the slightest bit of a reach. The display is bright and beautiful, and it's super quick with no lagging. If you watch videos or listen to music you'll notice that the sound quality is amazing, particularly with earphones.I take a lot of photos, so the camera was important too. This one is very nice and I've gotten some excellent pics of the cat (and really, what else are cameras for?). I tested it on notoriously difficult holiday lights at night, and it did very well. Looking forward to landscapes and snow scenes. And more cat. The only thing that bugs me is I keep accidentally minimizing apps by swiping too close to the bottom where the functions are. That's something you have to acclimate to, but hopefully I'll get there soon.Overall this is an excellent choice if you want a high quality phone that doesn't cost half a month's rent.","December 1, 2023"

36,OnePlus Nord N30,Wayward Canadian,5,"This phone is the BEST budget phone for me because I value the extremely long battery life, reallllly fast-charging & exceptional stereo speakers.  The CPU is a Qualcomm® Snapdragon™ 695 which allows me to multi-task at a good speed.  The biggest downside on this phone is the camera; it will take good photos in the daytime.  But, it does not take good photos of dimly lit situations which is OK with me because I NEVER use a smartphone to take important celebration photos which should always be taken with a Canon or Nikon camera.","June 29, 2024"

38,OnePlus Nord N30,Surfer90094,4,"I replaced my broken OnePlus 6, which was an older premium higher class OnePlus phone.  I paid a lot less for this phone.  I will say that spec-wise it is about equivalent and it has much faster internet access and 5G which I did not have before.  I am very satisfied with the phone except for one aspect.  The OnePlus 6 had a little slider on it.  When you go to bed, you just slide it up to vibrate only, or one more to the totally silent position.  On this phone you have to go sign in, then swipe up, then swipe down twice to get to the Do Not Disturb button and then click it.  So I have set up a schedule so it does this automatically, but I wish I did not have to do this.  This does not solve the problem if I go to a movie and don't want to not annoy others.  So overall for the money, a great phone.","January 22, 2024"
39,OnePlus Nord N30,brookhal,5,"First the performance, you won't get top tier performance out of the box, you have to tweak with some of the settings to get the best performance after setting it up. Once you do like I did, you get gaming, media, utilities at super fast speeds and fluidity. The screen goes up to 120hz which is basically a computer monitor in your pocket and the 6.7 inches of screen real estate was quite a shock of an upgrade coming from years of owning small expensive iPhones. Not to mention the transfer from an iPhone to OnePlus was super seamless, I had all my photos, messages, and passwords transfered without issue through the set-up screen. Which further shows how much thought and quality the Nord N30 5G truly is. The theme for this phone is called Oxygen OS which reminds me of the iPhone themes that you could only get by jailbreaking the phone and paying through a 3rd party software, they included a new interface, icons, and sounds that would cost money included with the proud ownship of this phone. Another surprising feature that is included is a thin screen protector that is always protecting the phone, so you don't have to buy another one if you want to buy I recommend it so that you can protect the screen protector because it is very thin and can scratch with regular use. The screen itself is incredible as well, I mentioned the 120hz screen but to see the colors and brightness even on lowish settings at night it is very bright for a screen, my old iPhone could not do that. On top of which, if you have a sedan or a more modern car that has a touch screen console, you will find that android auto is far better than apple carplay. The compatibility with the Nord N30 and your car is so great, the interface that you get with Android auto is much superior than carplay, so much so that carplay looks like child's play when in comparison. Overall a 300$ underdog of a device, that offers premium features like no other. OnePlus has does done a huge favor for people that aren't looking to spend 999$ on a new device. Ty for the incredible phone.","October 12, 2023"

One thing though. It does not have speed dial 😲... WTH!!!!  Won't buy another one for another 7 years hopefully.... PeaceAlso OnePlus Nord N30 phone need more options... Such as reminder alerts & some sort of 🚨 flashing of a alert reminder. There is NOTHING to let you know that you have a message, alert, missed call, voice mail, notification if you step away from your phone for a few minutes then come back to it... You have to remember to check it for missed whatever... I don't like that about this phone... People drive as myself & sometime  you have to step away from the phone for a minute or two. No indication of missed anything. Upgrade that & this would be a top tier phone in my opinion 😡... I almost want to return this phone cause of this missing important feature... My old phone had that feature setting... Alert/notification every 2,5,10 minutes until you answer or respond to the alert/notification... LG Stylo Plus...

45,OnePlus Nord N30,Pedro J Torres,3,If you don't need your phone to do things quickly and you don't mind photos that are low to mid quality then this is fine. If you're used to an older flagship phone you'll probably be disappointed. The battery life is pretty good but this phone's fingerprint reader is right in the wrong spot if you're left handed so that most of the time putting it into my left pocket it will be unlocked and running simply because my finger touches the sensor but it is just the natural spot for my finger to lay. Overall the phone gets things done but it's just  not impressive in any category.,"July 24, 2024"

47,OnePlus Nord N30,Dee Nice,5,"I wasn't sure about the N30, but now I am. Great device! I've had a variety of not so great androids, with some good ones like the galaxy S2, and pixel 3. This N30 replaces my OnePlus 9 5G that's just about 3 years old and the battery wears out quickly. 3 or 4 years is normally my upgrade window. To the phone: The N30's processing ability (695 Snapdragon) is on par or better than the 9's (888 Octocore), frame refresh rate is very good, pictures look good and the speakers also work very well. Games and videos stream smoothly, and how about the external memory capability? Not many devices support that feature anymore. I've had the phone for 3 days now and recharge only once a day, takes 30-40 or so minutes. The bottom line though is this phone performs really well. I added a nice protective case with a 256 GB micro SD card and I'm at a mere $310 including tax. My 9 5G was $700 alone. Absolutely awesome value at this price point. The money-saving value gives me the satisfaction equivalent of what a $1,200 flagship phone would provide. The Nord N30, I found a winner.","April 12, 2024"

57,OnePlus Nord N30,James Richardson,4,"The good part. I purchased this phone after I spent a lot of time comparing this phone with other budget android phones and some expensive ones. The OnePlus Nord N30 came out on top with better specs every time. When I received the phone I was happy with it.Now here's the bad part, Most video reviews claim the phone has a pre installed screen protector which by the way it tends to collect a lot of fingerprints and dust particles. When I decided to replace the screen protector I discovered that the phone had just a piece of sticky plastic film on the screen, not a real screen protector. I found this to ve very misleading and disappointing so I called Amazon customer service to report this issue and the they contacted the manufacturer.As you know a plastic film on the phone cannot protect your screen.However, this is a great option for a budget phone and I would highly recommend purchasing this one.","October 16, 2023"
58,OnePlus Nord N30,LMA Vista,3,First off for $250 this phone's a steal. I came from a Motorola one ace for $350 2 years ago and it does everything that phone did and little bit more.my only major gripe is for some reason this phone only supports super fast charging on its own proprietary standardand that is the only way you'll get fast charging. I mean why reinvent the wheel power delivery is been around for a long time now and supports at least six different voltages and at least three of them cross over into oneplus's proprietary standard so the phone could definitely charge on them about half as fast but insted they lock it so it can't. I can't in good conscience rate it anymore than three stars if they're too terrified to support universal charging standards that seems kind of ridiculous and a blemish and otherwise nearly perfect budget product. The main reason why it's important is if you have a laptop steam deck or another device that uses USB c power delivery you only need to carry one charger with you this phone will still charge slowly off of Power delivery but it seems to be hard locked at 5 volt meaning you'll only get around 10-15 watts of charge which would take hours for this phone to charge. Also being able to reuse charges from other manufacturers cuts down on a lot of e-waste that's unnecessary the first R is Reuse.,"December 30, 2023"

61,OnePlus Nord N30,forest,5,"I was somewhat sceptical about buying this phone. I'm glad I did. My previous phone was a Samsung S8, it was old. I wasn't really happy with Samung or the Samsung S8, I know being an older phone, it was prolly good in its day, but just not anymore. I wanted good processor speed, all the ram, and internal storage. When I found the N30 Nord, it had most everything I was looking for, and priced right. My only question was, will it work with Verizon, and the answer is yes, I had no issues switching phones. I do have the prepaid plan. If you go to the OnePlus website, it specifically has Verizon listed. Overall, this phone was far more than I expected and then some. To be honest, the reviews were correct about the camera, it could be better, but it still does ok, and I'm happy with ok. It doesn't not have wireless charging, but it does only take about 35 minutes to recharge with the 50w charger. Not sure if it's 100% as sturdy as I would like, I just expected something a bit heavier. But just in to be safe, I put a case on it as soon as I got it. Those were my only Cons. The Pros by far out way the cons. It doesn't get warm under high usage. The ram is expandable to 16gb using internal memory. 128gb storage. And I really like the layout. Just like anything new, it will take a bit to get used to some of the changes. Easy change over from old phone to new phone, you'll be prompted when setting up your new phone.

The support over time should improve camera qualities. If looking for a camera at similar prices, A54 or Pixel 6a are betterBattery - great usage out the box. One hour phone call along with installing apps for another 1.5 hours only brought battery down 13 percent. This is a full day and a half batteryCharging - the reason I bought this phone. For this price range, you will not find better and more secure charging. 20-30 mins and you  are setSnapdragon 695 5G - mid range master. Power consumption is stable and a proven processor.

65,OnePlus Nord N30,JW,5,"I love this phone.  Zero doubt.  The 50w charging from OnePlus that comes with it is insane.  At 7:15 this morning of writing this, I went from 19% (and that was left over from yesterday morning) to 90% by 7:50.  It is nuts.  Also, the camera are awesome.  I know there are some YouTube videos that talk about rating it lower due to not having an IP rating or a lower geekbench score, so yeah, if you are a HARD CORE gamer, you might want to maybe pass, and if you are so accident prone that you need an IP rating then, same, you might want to move on.  But for the price point, you can expand the memory in the SIM tray, you get a 3.5mm jack, and can expand the RAM virtually up another 8gb to 16gb.....you cannot beat it.  At all.  Plus it feels like OnePlus is getting back to the good old days of OnePlus with this one.Yeah, the back is a fingerprint magnet....no doubt, but put a case on it and you are good.  Who cares.Speaking of fingerprints....having the fingerprint sensor on the side is a natural feel and you will love it.Only thing I would recommend....if you want to spend about 70 more bucks, you can buy a refurb OnePlus 10 Pro which is insane better as far as flagships goes, but again with this one you get the expandable storage, 3.5mm, 50w charger....totally worth it.","November 7, 2023"

73,OnePlus Nord N30,Eddy,3,"This is a smartphone for less than $300 and you get exactly what you pay for. Some pros: the battery is amazing. It will last all day on heavy use. The processor is quick enough for email, web browsing, video and music use, and some basic games.Cons: the screen is very finicky. Often tapping a back button will somehow result in a double-tap. Scrolling down a page doesn't feel like a smooth glide but more clunky. The cellular reception on phone calls is quite poor. When indoors and on a call, often times you will be able to hear a caller but they are unable to hear you. The camera is also about mid-range quality.All in all, if you're not trying to spend $1000+ on a phone, this will fulfill your needs. If you need something with better quality and performance, the Nord series isn't for you. Please take this 3-star review as a badge of honor.

75,OnePlus Nord N30,James Geszvain,4,"I'll try to keep the review short and sweet. For $300, this is a great phone for the price. Coming from a $1k+ flagship (I broke the screen and was quoted $350+ for replacement) there are some drawbacks but that is to be expected.Positives; the specs are amazing, the battery lasts about 8 hours using it all day and charges fast, actually comes with a charger (unlike some trillion dollar companies), and it has headphone jack + expandable storage. I don't think there is much room to complain at this price point but I will still go over my least favorite aspects on this phone.The OnePlus UI/operating system is clunky, I prefer other Android phones. The power button is on the exact opposite side of the volume button, thus I have accidentally screenshotted dozens of times trying to power off the screen. Comes with all the Google bloatware you can think of. Camera quality is decent but definitely on the lower end, especially with competition from other cheap phones like Pixel. Would prefer a brighter screen. Main speaker on the bottom right... same spot I usually hold my phone so it muffles it a lot.

76,OnePlus Nord N30,Jin,5,"I was vacillating between purchasing a used Samsung or Google phone but came upon this OnePlus Nord N30 5G. I purchased 4 month old phone on a Amazon special for $237.00 and am absolutely thrilled with it! The price point for used phones all came with refurbished batteries and the reviews came mixed. The 5000mh on the OnePlus is one of the highlights of the phone. I do not game on my phone or use it for photos/video's. The photo's are okay, but the video is only 1080p. However, if you want the android experience with a cheap price, you cannot go wrong. The OxygenOS is close to vanilla and you are able to either uninstall or disable any of the OnePlus apps which is a huge plus.Another nice feature is the fingerprint sensor, it is quite responsive and located on the side of the phone, which is much more convenient than under the screen. It makes you realize how expensive it is for all the bells and whistles that come with the major players like Samsung and Android. The only thing I don't like is just one update eligibly for the Android OS. But, for $237, I'll look past it. I connected a Samsung Galaxy watch so I can enjoy the Samsung Pay without the Samsung pricey phone. Highly recommend for the budget consumer!","October 27, 2023"

The battery charges quickly and lasts two days for me with moderate usage (I'm not watching a lot of YouTube videos or keeping the screen on for hours on end, though). The fingerprint sensor has been accurate. With the high resolution option, the scrolling and motion on the phone look great. The 128GB storage space is adequate for my usage and the processing speeds on this phone have made multitasking easy. The phone has a nice, clean look and I was able to find a nice selection of phone cases for this model phone. My only gripe with this great device is the photo/video quality. Colors are often washed out and the images aren't sharp and clear as my Samsung S23 Ultra. For that reason alone, this phone can't be my main driver. It's perfect for my business lines or a backup phone, though. If you don't care about photo/video quality, there aren't many complaints you'd be able to make about this device. It's honestly great, for the price. OnePlus has earned my respect.","November 22, 2023"
85,OnePlus Nord N30,S Patil,4,"I like the phone.  It's the 3rd oneplus that I've had.  It's a good phone.  The only two big downsides I had for this phone when comparing to Apple and Samsung is that 1) the facial recognition is pretty poor.  it's just random when it decides to work or not, and if it's dark or anything at all around your face you can pretty much forget it.  2) the camera quality is pretty bad.  Luckily for me, I don't take a lot of photos so it doesn't bother me that much, but I would really have liked something that would at least look similar to an iphone's capability 10 years ago.","October 11, 2023"

91,OnePlus Nord N30,forest,5,Had several budget or so called mid range phones. Ive had the best luck with motos. But wanted something different and wanted the bug screen. Decided to take a chance. Ive been blow away. Battery insane. Fast charging boom!  Speakers are super loud. So far anything I've thrown it this phone it's handled with ease.  It worth noting the 108mp camera was not on by default. Turned that on and honestly it take pretty good pictures. Videos are good too. 5g on this thing Flys like s space shuttle. Running it cricket net work (att) zero issues.  Very very impressed with this phone.  The 120 refresh scolling is lag free. And I'm digging the oxygen os system. It's a nice spin on andriod.  Would definitely recommend this. It's a Big screen almost 6.8  with a knock off otter box case it 6.9 all day long.  Very very pleased with my first one plus,"November 22, 2023"
92,OnePlus Nord N30,Drew,5,"So overall the phone is amazing, finger print works great like my Motorola. Pretty fast, Great size, I prefer bigger phones. NFC which is a positive. One plus is a great brand. I been using Motorola for years and I think one plus is similar. After android 14 no more os updates in this phone which is what made me not want this phone as well. You really can't tell it's a mid range phone. But unfortunately I returned it due to the only having one os update. One issue is customer service. It's a stupid ups pick up, I been waiting two weeks for my refund and still says return started. I tracked the phone and it was delivered to warehouse two days after ups picked up. Idk if it's Amazon or the seller but it's horrible, I don't think all ordered a phone through amazing again. I just preordered my pixel 8 pro and it's amazing. Anyone interested make sure your set on phone because return/refund is a hot mess. But for someone who doesn't care about how many os updates this is a great phone for you.","October 11, 2023"
93,OnePlus Nord N30,ja,2,"Likes:  the battery life seems very good, even if running many apps.  the big charging brick and gimmicky red cord charge really well, including other phonesDislike:  the phone takes a long time to boot up and to power down.  the method of turning the phone off - simultaneously holding the POWER ON and VOLUME UP is a disaster!  Half the time only the volume button responds, the rest of the time the shutoff screen appears then disappears!  Most disappointing:  I don't think I am going to be able to get it to work with Tracfone.  I have been with Tracfone's tech support for five hours over two days and they have not been able to sort it out.  I get 2 or 3 bars on the display but an unable to make or receive calls.","July 28, 2024"
94,OnePlus Nord N30,B,3,"They (most reviewers) said it was overstated, but that was an overstatement.  The camera image and video quality is very poor throughout.

Seriously cut the corners extrmemely hard on the camera.

Everything is buttery smooth, fast and just works great. Pics are great too, although I never had an issue with any of my OnePlus phones pictures. Great battery life and love the fast charging, especially compared to the turtle slow and very picky charging of my Pixel phone.

97,OnePlus Nord N30,jerome,3,"Does everything I need, call, text, chat, work related apps. The processor is not so powerful so HD videos can be stuttering sometimes. Good enough cell signal domestically and internationally.The reason for only 3 star is the terrible button layout. The fingerprint reader is on the power button on the right side of the phone. Directly across the phone are the volume up and down buttons. So whenever I need to turn off the screen, I would squeeze the phone to press the power button, and often press the volume buttons at the same time, which the phone would register to take a screenshot, or prompt you to shutdown the device. It's annoying enough for a 3 star which would otherwise be a 5 for the price and provided features.","January 30, 2024"

Additionally, OnePlus devices usually offer impressive camera systems with multiple lenses for versatile photography.When reviewing a specific model like the OnePlus Nord N30 5G, it's essential to consider its display quality, processing power, camera capabilities, battery life, software features, and overall user experience.

99,OnePlus Nord N30,Nathan,4,I am satisfied with the One Plus N5. For the money it is better than the other prepaid phone I had. There's no problem watching video or listening to music. It holds everything I need especially since I can add a micro card up to 1TB. I just wish it would let you make the 1TB storage space as your phone memory. I hope they integrate this into the phone soon. It's the only draw back.,"December 24, 2023"
100,OnePlus Nord N30,Yalal Besereni,5,"I'm not the most demanding of technical wizardry, but this phone meets all my needs. It replaces a Moto G7 Plus with a dead battery. The aspect ratio is narrower but longer, thus the details on the screen are smaller, but everything works fine, i.e., it is very responsive, fingerprint reader is fine, the screen is sharp enough with good color, and most importantly the phone and texting works fine with good sound. There is one minor annoyance with the Oxygen OS which is that whenever you choose to close all open apps, one app remains on the screen for you to swipe off every time. No biggie, and not a deal breaker. Recommended.","February 14, 2024"
101,OnePlus 1216GB RAM512GBDualSIMUnlocked,Emmanuel,5,"I've been waiting to get the 12 for a while now coming from a 9 PRO.  I went with this one for the new camera setup which I do NOT regret.  Great wide angle to zoom and macro.  Hi Res photos print well on 3x2 ft canvas.  The phone itself is speedy and battery actually lasts through the day. Screen resolution is fantastic even at reduced DPI which I use for battery conservation.  Wireless charging works flawlessly through a thick case, audio quality is perfectly clear both directions.

102,OnePlus 1216GB RAM512GBDualSIMUnlocked,Ariel Quintero,5,"Disclaimer: I use this phone mainly to talk, text and peruse social media.  I don't do too many live videos or take a ton of photos.This phone does a great job in everything although it's really not a master in anything outside of battery life and charging options.  I get a full day out of this phone easily.  Usually around the 1 day, 3 to 5 hour mark before I charge each day.  I usually charge when the phone gets between 20-25%.  I can leave my house at 35% or even go to bed at 15% and never worry about running out of juice.  And even if I'm low on juice, I can charge this phone from 20-100% in about 25 minutes.  I am amazed at how I can put this phone on the charger and in just a matter of 5 minutes I've gained about 20% of power.  Even when using a USB charger, it's still pretty fast.  Wireless charging is about average.  That is the phone's biggest strength.As far as talking goes, it has a good quality sound.  Coming from a Samsung 20 FE (Verizon service), I found myself missing a call now and then (goes straight to voicemail) or drops in audio when I took calls at home.  I've yet to have a problem with the OnePlus, so I'm guessing the internal anntenna is better because I'm still with Verizon.There are a lot of audio playback options available (Dolby Atmos, Spatial, etc.) and I haven't tried them all out yet, but the speakerphone sounds loud and crisp.  However, when I connect to a Bluetooth speaker or in my car's audio system, the volume tends to be lower.  I have to really crank up the volume in my car or max out my Bluetooth speaker to hear clearly.  However, maybe there's an option I'm missing in the settings that would help me.And there are a ton of options in the settings!  It can be overwhelming to someone who isn't tech-saavy, but it's not as bad as it looks.  Most of the settings are basic on the surface, but if you go into the sub-menus then it will get more advanced.  But you can control things to enhance the already superior battery life to changing your refresh rate for smoother scrolling.  Just about everything else is typical Android stuff, but OnePlus has some nice features of its own with the Floating Window and One-Hand Scrolling.The phone needs a case.  It's not easy to this phone even with both hands.  I wouldn't advise anyone try it unless they have pretty big hands.  It will probably drop as you are texting.  But that's not a deal-breaker because cases are inexpensive.The media on this phone is smooth.  It looks really good and there are options to tweak it even more.  Someone who is an avid TikTok or IG fan will be at home with this phone.  The camera takes amazing photos.  Unfortuantely, I haven't been on vacation yet to give it a real try, but what I've taken so far are very nice.  Definitely a little clearer and more realistic than my Samsung 20 FE.  Recording video is pretty impressive, too, but I've yet to do a live or video call.Anyone who pays almost double for an iPhone or Samsung is really just seeking the brand.  Yes, those phones may have a few more bells and whistles with A.I. and they may have slightly (arguably) better cameras.  But if those phones are a 10 on a scale of 1-10 then the OnePlus is a 9.  And it is much, much more inexpensive to the point that you could probably get two of these for the price of an iPhone or Galaxy 24.","April 30, 2024"
103,OnePlus 1216GB RAM512GBDualSIMUnlocked,Emmanuel,5,"I have been using this phone for a month now. I LOVE it. I have always own a galaxy and decided i wanted to try something different. The phone i had was a galaxy note 20, it got broken during hurricane beryl.Anyways the most important thing to me in a phone are camera quality and battery life and my oneplus 12 top tier 100% .I was shocked when i scroll on tiktok for 20- 25mins maybe longer and the battery remains at 100%..mind blowing to me. I have gone 2 days without charging this phone, While using netflix and tiktok often.Camera is amazing and i love the additional features for editing pictures... I have no issue with this phone so far. However i cannot use the camera in tiktok to make video, tiktok downgrade the camera terribly, but outside of tiktok GREAT, CLEAN AND BEAUTIFUL. 💕💕Omg i almost forgot.. My phone charges in 30mins tops, n that's when battery life is at the lowest of 2%. 🤯🤯There is so much i want to say, the zoom quality, the phone features, etc..

104,OnePlus 1216GB RAM512GBDualSIMUnlocked,Quincy,5,"I had the oneplus 11 before this and switched to the pixel 8 pro thinking it would be a better phone... suffice it to say I was wrong. Now I have the OnePlus 12 and if they keep this level of quality up I will never switch to another brand again.Compared to the OnePlus 11:Better camerasFaster CPUBrighter displayCharges a bit fasterBuild feels more premiumCompared to the Pixel 8 Pro:CPU is not even in the same realm. OnePlus doesn't get hot unless you're really pushing it for long periods and has so much more raw horsepower.Similar level of premium build quality, but feels more comfortable in the hand due to curved edges.Wayyyyyy faster charging. This makes a huge difference for me because I use my phone heavily all day for both work and personal use. Just being able to boost the charge to 50% quickly is a game changer. Pixel takes 1.5h to fully charge most of the time even with good chargers.Camera quality is roughly the same. I compared telephoto photos at 6x to pixel's 5x and detail was very very close. As a photographer I prefer the more natural look you get from OnePlus.Price... this one is obvious. OnePlus definitely wins here.Software is good on the OnePlus. Better than it's ever been actually. Pixel has a couple of benefits here thanks to AI but I personally never used them so I can't really compare. OnePlus 12 animations feel more fluid and pleasing though.I'll update this if I run into any issues. So far the software has been roughly as stable as Pixel itself so no complains there and I hope the phone continues to work as well for me as it does now.I strongly recommend this to anyone except for those who require an S-Pen or just have extra money to spend for no reason.","February 25, 2024"
105,OnePlus 1216GB RAM512GBDualSIMUnlocked,Carona Allen,5,Blazing fast. I can play the latest games and watch videos on this beautiful phone. The games play at their absolute best and older games can shine with the features added to optimize gameplay and graphics. Charging is phenomenal and battery life has exceeded my expectations. I can even expand my RAM even further than the 16 GB in the phone by using my SSD space. I would recommend this phone for those who want a blazing fast experience at a great cost.,"August 10, 2024"
106,OnePlus 1216GB RAM512GBDualSIMUnlocked,Dustin Lane,4,"I once had a OnePlus 8 I think... It came with its own apps. Phone, messages, calendar, email, etc... This phone comes with all Google Apps. Including the keyboard. Apparently OnePlus has given up on actually building solid apps and are just slapping Google apps into it. Had I known this I would have probably gotten a Google Pixel or Samsung phone.The allure of OnePlus was that I was freeing myself from these corporate eco-systems that harvest my data and provide no privacy. Well not anymore. With the OnePlus 12 you get the Google Phone app, Google Messenger, Google Calendar, Gmail (so none of my private email accounts I use on my own domains can be added without routing all my email through Google servers to be scanned). At least OnePlus gave me a Notes app! You can disable these apps in the app manager but you can't uninstall them.If I don't want my text messages scanned and synced with Google I could download a 3rd party texting app, same for all the other system apps. But there's two problems. First is that other apps are way less trustworthy, and secondly they often cost additional money to buy. And who knows when and how they might get ""updated"" over time.What really drives me crazy is that this phone uses Gboard, Googles keyboard. I have no idea what Google is collecting from everything I type. I really wanted a free from big tech phone. I thought OnePlus was different. This is a sad day.Other than this being a Google-everything phone, it's pretty good. The hardware is solid but the software could use some polishing. The camera is good but the built in editing software is horrendous. The camera doesn't shoot using the full amount of megapixels unless you switch it to a special mode, and then it can only shoot in RAW or JPEG... Not HEIF for some reason. Weird. Since HEIF supports 10bit and 4:2:2 color and smaller file sizes. Nope. If you want to use the full 50MP it's either massive RAW file or JPEG.The screen edges are curved. Makes it feel like a phone from 10 years ago. But the screen is bright and beautiful.By default the screen resolution is lowered, I left it that way because I can't see the difference. The power mode is lowered, again, left it that way because its so fast and snappy I can't imagine wanting more. The battery life is AMAZING... At the lowered resolution and power mode.I use Nova Launcher because I cannot stand the Google Discovery thing being baked into this phone. If you swipe all the way to the left it pulls up Google Discovery. And you can't turn it off. I hate Google and want nothing to do with their stuff. This phone really forces everything Google on you.Do I like the phone? Yes. Do I love it? No. I hope OnePlus goes back to building their own apps and not just cramming Googles into it. If in wanted Google I'd buy Google Pixel.The slogan of the OnePlus company is ""never settle."" Well, not only did they settle, they seem to have given up. And I can't settle on this phone.","July 3, 2024"
107,OnePlus 1216GB RAM512GBDualSIMUnlocked,Patrick,5,"I've had this phone for one month or so and it's without any doubt the best I've ever owned. I currently have a Samsung 23+, Pixel 8 (non pro), and they are not even close in regards to the pleasant experience this phone gives. Also I have not had any issues at all.Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Android Auto, texting, calls, etc. all work very well. The speaker sound is excellent. It has a very nice screen and it's super smooth. It also has the silent slider on the side of the phone, just like the OnePlus 8T that I once had, which is very useful. The haptics are the best I've felt in any phone I've had before, comparable to pixel phones, however there are two separate haptic syles you can choose from, and they have adjustments for intensity. As for the camera, I have taken a hand full of photos and they are much better than expected. In my opinion, the photos are also comparable to the Pixel phone quality or at least very close to it; the camera also has a very good zoom if you need it.The UI is not stock Android but it's comparable in many ways, with more customization. There are a lot of useful features, such as different dark mode styles; natural tone display, which helps keep the screen color the same as the ambient lighting changes; ultra anti flicker (a huge feature for me personally), for if you are sensitive to PWM (this causes eyestrain and headaches); and many other unique features that are actually useful.","March 9, 2024"

As it turns out, this phone is in perfect condition and well worth the price paid.  I love the OnePlus line, and plan to stick with it as long as they continue to produce phones.

109,OnePlus 1216GB RAM512GBDualSIMUnlocked,Michael Lynn,5,"Only dislikes are the limitations China put on the US version vs the international (80W charging instead of 100, max 512G storage instead of standard 1T.. but all still very impressive, especially since iPhone, Gpixel and Galaxy all have lower stats for greater price) The wireless charging (50W) is faster than any US wired charging, like come on! The huge battery capacity is wonderful, and any unused storage can be used as additional ram, so F yea! Cam stats are great. The slightly less AI (compared to Google for example) can be a pro or con by personal preference, but the OS has the lease bloatware I've ever experienced which is refreshing. Gives all you need plus much more, and what's lacking isn't particularly necessary, so the value is insanely high! I'm so glad I found this phone and am still bragging about its capabilities a year later with competition still falling short.","September 1, 2024"
110,OnePlus 1216GB RAM512GBDualSIMUnlocked,Lynn Moorhead,4,"I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5. The phrase ""everything is very good but not great"" applies to every aspect of this phone. In that respect, it is a lot like the Oneplus 11, just a little better in all areas. For example, the battery life is very good but not quite as good as you'd think it would be. The camera is very good but not quite as good as it could be. Same for the display, speed, the quality of the enclosure (the build quality) and every other conceivable thing a person would want out of a smartphone today, except that all of them lack SD cards. At least you get a charger with the Oneplus. Ok, I take it back, the charger is great, yep and one comes with it too ! The OS overlay, whatever it is, is good but not great. And so on. Oneplus has manged to hit the 8/10 bullseye with this because I don't have anything to complain about, except the totally needless complexity of the latest builds of Android, which is not Oneplus's fault.  And if you've seen the utterly needlessly complex latest versions of IOS, I consider Android to be less needlessly complex, by a few hairs. Could be a little cheaper but then you could say that about all high end smartphones. A totally solid choice and you don't get the feeling you've been ripped off that badly.","July 28, 2024"
111,OnePlus 1216GB RAM512GBDualSIMUnlocked,Emmanuel,5,"Camera: Despite what others might say, I love this camera and it's what keeps me coming back to OnePlus, I swapped from the OP 10 Pro to OP12 and it was definitely worth it. It takes beautiful videos and photos, movie mode is really good for raw colors, HDR/XDR brings out more contrast between everything.Charging: It has the super charger which charges your phone the fastest on the market without heating up too much, It has tons of new heat sensors that will prevent it from overheating especially while charging and it has new vapor chambers to disperse heat more quickly.Quality: It has good build quality, it's a bit on the heavier side but honestly it makes up for it with its quality.Size: I would say the size is pretty standard, larger than my OP10P but not too big to where it's a pain.Overall it's a good, even great phone especially for the price point. If you would have got this when it first dropped they gave the higher end storage away for the same price as the lower end one, now I think you have to pay for the extra storage just like any other phone.I definitely recommend this phone, I'm looking forward to the newer OnePluses, especially with hassleblad collaborations.","July 28, 2024"
112,OnePlus 1216GB RAM512GBDualSIMUnlocked,Ariel Quintero,5,"My review will not sway most but if you are curious about OnePlus...take the step.  My son convinced me many years ago to try it. I really like the brand but be warned it is hard to go back to slow charging so OnePlus has a real niche. When my 9pro suffered a smashed screen, I went back to my old Samsung s22 while I considered my options.  That S22 helped me decide on OnePlus again.  I rely on phone hotspot and field a lot of calls each day for my job. Even when new my S22 would need some top off.  The OnePlus needs to be charged similarly but...I can get a full charge in no time.  Insane recharge speed.  When on the go, this phone has been a saving grace.","August 18, 2024"
113,OnePlus 1216GB RAM512GBDualSIMUnlocked,AmazonCustomer,4,"I finally pulled the trigger a few months ago to upgrade from my OnePlus 6T to the 12. Battery life of the 12 is wonderful. My 6T after the many years had a battery lifespan of only half a day, this OP12 one has days! What a game changer! Performance and picture quality is great, although wish the camera was more centered for the OCD type people...The curved display however not a fan of. Seems like some buttons on the sides don't respond very well and this gets annoying at times. USB photo or file transfer has also an issue when trying to use a USB 3.0 port on the PC. Somehow it does not want to open the folder or times out trying to. USB 2.0 port works just fine, but slower transfer speed unfortunately.

114,OnePlus 1216GB RAM512GBDualSIMUnlocked,Aaron H,5,"I had just about given up on finding a suitable replacement for my dying OnePlus 7 Pro (battery health is 70% and the USB-C port and various radios are acting up) when I finally stumbled onto the 12 series.I first tried the 12R but I hated the camera and, to be honest, I still don't like the point-and-shoot performance of this one vs the 7 Pro with the GCam app, but I love the optical zoom lens and I'll figure out a way to make the rest of the cam cluster work for me. It seems to suffer mostly indoors with the main lens. And there's a weird push toward a lack in depth-of-field in digital imaging sensors or post-processjng (I don't know which) these days that I'm not loving too much. I don't shoot video hardly at all and a 32MP selfie cam just seems like overkill to me but, camera business aside, the phone is like a laptop you can hold and use anywhere with one hand.I'm a OnePlus guy but the last few series just didn't seem worth an upgrade and now this thing is just ridiculously powerful and anything else you can imagine in a phone. It has more customization than I can really force myself to dig into and the basic stuff is easy to get to.I don't care what ColorOS folks say—OxygenOS is more than anyone needs. I don't need color notification icons on my lock screen. Give me a break. If I need thousands of wallpapers and stuff to choose from, the Zedge app is free and exhaustive.And I'm not much on style, to be honest, but the backplate on this (green) thing is the most gorgeous device surface I've ever seen. I really didn't think the blue backing on the 7 Pro could be beaten. Fuh-gettaboutit. I wish I could bring myself to use the thing without a case, it's that attractive.This thing (the 512GB/16GB version) has as much storage as my laptop and twice as much RAM. It charges from 0-100% wired (CHARGER INCLUDED IN THE-BOX HERE—SAMSUNG, GOOGLE, SONY!) in a half-hour and wireless in an hour AND the charge seems to last forever. Sometimes it seems like it takes an hour or two for the indicator to come down off of 100%. The old, nagging ""Where's the charger?"" feeling is really nice to be over but admittedly not completely banished from my head yet. It honestly feels like I only need to charge it in my car (SUPERVOOC 80w Car Charger only $20 here) for a few minutes a day and never at home. I'm seriously considering turning on the ""charge only to 80%"" battery life saving thingy-ma-bob/feature/setting.The performance is just breathtaking. I honestly don't think I'm going to bother replacing my 6-year-old Dell Inspiron when it finally gives up the ghost. As good a value as it is compared to other brands' flagships, $900 is not what I originally set out to spend on a new phone. No complaints, though. I understand the effects of post-COVID Tech economics and I'll just have to sacrifice somewhere else. Hopefully it'll hold up for another 5 years or so like the 7 Pro did.OnePlus really knocked it out of the park with this one. :)","March 28, 2024"
115,OnePlus 1216GB RAM512GBDualSIMUnlocked,Pita,5,"It's a familiar feeling. Having moved up from a now 4 year old phone. I'm surprised how familiar it feels to navigate and use right out of the box. The major change is the camera for me. The camera is really good. The specs are what attracted me to the phone first and foremost and it delivers. But it doesn't do anything that isn't printed in the box. I can't help but like finding new things, small details, quality of life that has changed - and finding those things as I use and explore the phone, that sorta everyday mondaine happiness of a Thursday afternoon or something idk, but it's not here.Tl;Dr it's better but better is all it is.

116,OnePlus 1216GB RAM512GBDualSIMUnlocked,MD Wright,5,"This replaced one of my two Smart phones - a Samsung Galaxy S22 plus.  The price on Prime day was fantastic for what the phone offers.  For me - call quality is very important and this was a big improvement over what I was using.  The camera is intuitive and the phone is very responsive overall.  It was easy to transfer a lot of data and apps from my Galaxy S22 plus to the One Plus 12, and move the phone number.  As always Android phones are much more flexible in how you use and organize them.  The unlocked version had no bloatware I could detect.  I recommend buying an unlocked version of the One Plus 12  and using a prepaid service that is not deprioritized.  You'll save yourself a lot of money and give up nothing in quality.","August 7, 2024"
117,OnePlus 1216GB RAM512GBDualSIMUnlocked,Jose L Ramirez,5,This is a great phone. It Rivals the best iPhone and Samsung Galaxy at a fraction of the price. It is quick responsive takes excellent photos and has plenty of storage. I have noticed it heat up from time to time with excessive use. However the battery lasts all day comes with a quick I think a hundred watt charging adapter and cable. It is a larger phone so if you have small hands you might want to consider your purchase.

Now that it has been a few months, I can safely say this has been the best phone I have had in a long while. I don't need to charge it over night and its pretty easy to get used to. Only reason I put it at 4 stars is because for some strange reason, any LTE data is seen as hotspot data when used with a VPN. This would not be so bad but if you are with a carrier with limited hotspot data but unlimited LTE data it can lead to confusion like it did for myself. Otherwise, its great!","July 22, 2024"
120,OnePlus 1216GB RAM512GBDualSIMUnlocked,Chubbybeard,5,"Former Samsung user here, always using their flagship phones but decided to try OnePlus. I wish I made that decision earlier! First of all, I bought an ""used"" in good condition, the cheapest I could find on Amazon, let me tell you that even though the shipping was not so fast like all the prime purchases I've done, when I got it I got an almost new device. I would say it was new in open box. Not a single scratch, I spent a couple of minutes inspecting it and found nothing that would make it used. The charging speed is crazy, takes about 30 minutes or less to fully charge it after it reaches 15 percent. Battery life is awesome, fingerprint scanner is pretty good as well. There is absolutely no cons about this phone, performance is almost perfect with no problems, no overheating at all even with the heaviest games. Do your research and you'll see that you are getting a Flagship for half of the price. I don't think I will ever go back to another phone brand other than OnePlus!

124,OnePlus 1216GB RAM512GBDualSIMUnlocked,Jesus Rodriguez,5,The phone is a beast. I only have one complaint and that it's when you're shooting a master mode you can't take full resolution images you have to switch to high res mode and in high res mode you don't have manual control.I think the Pixel might have slightly better image quality out of the box but with the high res mode on the OnePlus 12 and with studio lighting and a tripod you can get some really good detail even macro.Everything else on this phone is beast I would say even best. I don't think I've ever reached below 40% battery.And the curved screens that's the real reason I got this over the others but there are so many reasons I'm satisfied with the decision.The operating system is pretty sweet too.,"July 10, 2024"

I was wrong and I will never go back. This is the best phone you can have and you can save some money too. Everything is outstanding on it, Battery life for 2 or more days, then I can connect it to the charger for 20 mins and that's it, I don't have to worry anymore for Battery or charging times, nothing, a tremendous relieve for sure. I consider everything else better than previous phones and a better value than iPhone 14 pro max and Samsung S23 Ultra (My previous) so I can recommend it to anyone without any hesitation.07/13/2024Downgraded to 3 stars cause of Oneplus updates.I used to love my OP12, but after the last update ( June-July/2024) this phone is a mess, extremely buggy, Gmail is frozen every 2 or 3 times I open it, I cannot hang up calls, sometimes the call does not go thru in or out, I have missed several calls from my work team and relatives as well, some apps are not working or stopped working in the middle of something. I had to buy an iPhone 15 in a rush to avoid communication issues both at home and work (Since I'm working remotely). It's been a very bad and sad 2-3 weeks till I decided to switch for good, I cannot wait for a month to the next update to see if everything has been fixed. This is an amazing phone and I loved it, also I have the Oneplus watch 2 and this is a killer combination, I did forget about chargers and charging time with this two and it is a shame that this is happening to this flagship. I think Oneplus must take note on this and never have the same mistake again, this is not a cheaper device either. Disappointed.BTW I was using it on Google Fi (eSim) without issues till the last update.Also, solutions: In crashed apps you have to close and reopen them, most of the time they are working again. No need to clear cache or anything else, at least I do not have to.For calls: Worked for me to change the audio to Speakers during the call and then hang up, be aware that sometimes when you do it the phone app hang up by itself (It is randomly). I never tried the airplane mode, but some people say that is working too for this.For missing calls, I did not find a solution, Google Fi customer service did not know what was causing it.","June 3, 2024"

136,OnePlus 1216GB RAM512GBDualSIMUnlocked,Fit perfectly,5,"At first I thought it did not work. I was using with Mint Mobile and when I installed my SIM, it didn't work. If you're going to use Mint, here's a tip. When they send you a SIM card, they send 2 cards! The one you ordered, and another, for a friend!?! But I wasn't expecting 2 SIM cards and had no idea there were 2 in the box, so I just opened the box and installed the first card I found, not thinking there was another one. Turns out I installed the extra card which they give you to give a friend LOL? Kinda strange, right! Once we figured out that was the issue, it was smooth sailing. I installed the other SIM that was there, unbeknownst to me, and it worked like a charm. I also tested it briefly with TMobile, and it worked without any problem. So the phone is unlocked and I can vouch that it works on those networks. Pro tip: If you need Mint support, it's better to get phone support if you can, because chat support was definitely much less informed of how to troubleshoot my issue, and I almost thought I'd need to return the phone. Also, make sure you really want this phone before purchasing it! Because Amazon return policy forces you to do a UPS pickup on returns, if you choose to return. So you have to wait around all day for UPS to come to your door to return the phone, and it sounds like it can be a real drag. They'll also take their sweet time returning the funds to your bank. So, thankfully, I am keeping this one, and so far, I'm liking it. It's VERY zippy! Also, very slippery! Get a case, as it will fall from your hands constantly! Good luck.","March 9, 2024"

I tested running a YouTube video for 24 hours and the phone ended at ~15% at the end, and it was running cool not hot.Unfortunately the phone is just legitimately gigantic. I couldn't imagine carrying it around with me day to day. It hardly fit in any pants pockets I wore, and I imagined it trying to fit into shorts pockets... Right now I'm using a Razr Flip 2023 so maybe I'm just spoiled but this phone was too big for me.Camera quality was also great and looked very nice. Sound quality was pretty solid too. The charging wasn't as fast as I expected but the battery is pretty big so that makes sense.Performance seemed pretty solid but I don't mobile game or do anything too intensive on phones honestly.Overall, if this phone was 1 or 2 inches smaller I'd love it, but it's too big to be practical for me. Right where you'd want your hand to rest is where the huge camera notch is too.TDLR: Great phone but too big for me.

149,OnePlus 1216GB RAM512GBDualSIMUnlocked,Norka Balvuena,5,"Have been a LG user since their first Android phone. Since LG is out of the phone market now I had to find a different phone to replace my Velvet 5G. After looking at options for almost 2 months I heard about the OnePlus 12. Got it on the monthly no interest plan with intent to keep it if I liked it or send it back if I didn't. To be honest this phone is pretty much perfect. 16GB of RAM + the phone's ability to use extra storage as temporary RAM is almost obscenely fast for a mobile device. 512GB of on board storage will hold pretty much anything I could need for the foreseeable future. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 tears through games like a hot knife in butter, and the phone automatically adjusts settings for best experience. Now that brings me to the final piece of this pie: the battery. This sucker is massive, and paired with the included power brick and charger cable it routinely charges from under 15% to 100% in 20 minutes. I have spent 12 hours using it non-stop and barely dropped past 40%.This may come off like an advertisement but I simply cannot overstate how much I enjoy this phone. If I had any complaint it would probably be the curved screen. You'll want a case on the phone or if you're like me and have fat hands you'll routinely tap the screen on accident.","March 6, 2024"

That hasn't happened to me before with any other new phone.Third was that even though I set the battery to stop charging at 80%, regardless of it notifying that it stopped, it still kept charging the battery all the way to 100%. If it disregarded the battery's charging limit, what else would it disregard?Fourth was that the camera quality left a lot to be desired in terms of sharpness and detail, especially in RAW format.I have a OnePlus 9 and although the cameras have older sensors that aren't as good as the OnePlus 12's in difficult light situations, the pictures look sharper and more detailed. I mean actual definition, not the appearance of false detail.I decided to return it to Amazon, since the unit is clearly flawed from the factory.

Since I bought a cheap OnePlus model once, I was somewhat familiar with the brand, and I bough OnePlus Nord N30 for my wife (which is also a great budget phone). I was hesitant to buy OnePlus 12 because its price is well above the budget phone prices,  but boy I am happy I decided to take the risk. It has everything that Pixel and Samsung lacks. The Pixel may take the best pictures overall, but I am buying the phone not the camera, and this phone pictures are excellent anyway.

Theres so much to say about this phone honestly so many feats packed into a 6.82 inch form factor is just brilliant. The design is also brilliant and def will require a case for sure. Thank you OnePlus for making another Flagship device for under $900 (Pre order paid for) I am very satisfied and this is my 3rd One Plus phone (One Plus 7T, One Plus 7 PRO, One Plus 9 PRO)  I've been a Big OnePlus fan and will continue to be. Thank you 🙏🫡","February 22, 2024"

I came across a lot of reviews for the OnePlus 12 and they were all great. I purchased the OnePlus 12 and it is now my favorite phone. It is an absolute speed beast.

I picked up a Pixel 8 Pro to use as my second line for work and was disappointed. I then found this, and just wow. Love it. It is speedy, great battery life, takes great pictures, and has good sound quality. The display is really nice on this as well, and love the rounded edges of it. Been awhile since I had a phone with that. This has not replaced my 14 Pro Max for several reasons, I do reach for it more and more. That says something.","May 28, 2024"

It has a Pop Out Selfie Camera, 90hz, 12gb RAM, Fast Charging, Great Screen, and the photos rivaled my wife's current S22u in some cases! It was so good, that every phone since the 7T McLaren just couldn't reach the bar that phone set. Now here's the 12. And this is the one. This is the keeper, and will be my next daily driver for hopefully the same amount of time as my 7 series! Camera in this phone is absolutely brilliant. The screen is bright-Very Bright- and smooth as butta. Colors are vibrant, sound is clear, and very easy on the eyes. Battery?!? Did someone say battery? This thing is a beast!

Camera pics onxe you lean the modes is fantastix. The zoomed mode works well. Video recording is good.  Speakers sound is loud with a touch of bass. Haptic feedback is unreal on this phone.  So far there nothing I've found that I don't like.  If your new to one plus plan on spending a ton of time getting to tweak things the way you like.  This. Is my first with one plus. Came from a Samsung note ultra  series and this blows the Samsung out of the water in my view.  Fast charing fast charing holy..... It's nuts. There so much that this phone is offering I don't think you be displeased.  Go for broke and get one!!!And for the internet warriors about the camera. I sapped a ton of picts with it and am quite please with the shots. Details and saturation for me look better.  I'm really diggin this phone.

I carry my charger with me and it charges up to 100 in 30 minutes! I recommend this phone to anyone who loves android and clean software. I am a student on a budget and this phone surpassed my expectations. My only gripe is the software can (rarely) be a little buggy but that's few and far in between. I plan to have this phone for years. Works great with Visible by Verizon.Pros:•Great value for the price!•Amazing battery life•Extremely fast charging•Accurate and fast fingerprint sensor•Great speakers•Amazing screen•Great cameras (not as good as some other flagships, but definitely good)•Fast (the Gen 2 Snapdragon is almost too overpowered and efficient, great for emulation like PS2, 3DS, Switch)•Stays cool (has a dedicated cooling system)•Clean software•Fast Bluetooth connectivity•NFC•8GB RAM + more from system storage if needed•Premium build quality•2 year limited warranty with optional extended warrantiesCons:•Only 3 years of android updates, 4 years of security updates (compared to Apple and Samsung, it's on the shorter side)•Sometimes a lil buggy (not often, but worth mentioning)•Face Unlock doesn't work well (I don't use it anyways)•128GB storage gets taken up by system storage and ""other"" files","August 23, 2024"
201,OnePlus 12R 8GB,Frank H,5,"Battery is enormous lasting almost a full day and a half of screen on time. Charging is crazy fast, 0-100 in under 30mins which is wild. Also doesn't get hot when ultra fast charging as I use Accubattery to check temps when charging. Software and day to day usage is smooth as can be with 120hz, little to no stuttering and lag noted. Display looks great. Camera is fine enough for me, I hardly ever take pics. For $400 dollars its arguably the best cost to performance I've had for a phone ever since I started using android around the oneplus 3t and LG V10 era. I use it 95% of the time for media consumption. Reading, watching videos, listening to music. Audio as well is exceptional due to Dolby speakers. They sound great. Love the phone. Only negative is that it 100% needs a case for comfortable hand usage, too slippery otherwise. Using on AT&T in Cali, good reception","July 30, 2024"

203,OnePlus 12R 8GB,Jay,5,"Having used the OnePlus 12R for the past four months, I can confidently say it offers excellent value for users looking for a powerful and long-lasting smartphone without breaking the bank. Here's a closer look at its strengths and weaknesses:Pros:  Excellent Battery Life: The 5500mAh battery is truly impressive. On moderate usage, you can easily get a full day or even two on a single charge.  Blazing-Fast Charging: The 100W SUPERVOOC charging is incredibly fast. You can go from near empty to a full charge in about 26 minutes, according to OnePlus.  Powerful Performance: The Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor, paired with 16GB of RAM in this configuration, delivers smooth performance for everyday tasks and even demanding games.  Great Display: The 6.78-inch 120Hz ProXDR display is bright, clear, and responsive, making it a joy to use for watching videos, browsing the web, or gaming.  Large Storage: With 256GB of storage, you have ample space for apps, photos, videos, and other files.Cons:  No Wireless Charging: This might be a dealbreaker for some users who have grown accustomed to the convenience of wireless charging.  Uninspiring Design: The design leans toward the generic side and doesn't offer the same level of flair as some other flagship phones.  Lacks Versatility in Cameras: While the 50MP main sensor takes decent photos, the overall camera system isn't as versatile as some competitors, lacking a telephoto lens and offering only a basic ultrawide sensor.  Software Update Concerns: OnePlus offers only two years of software updates for the 12R, which is less than what some other manufacturers provide.","April 21, 2024"
204,OnePlus 12R 8GB,BigSky2CDA,4,"I have not had a problem with the phone.  First week with it, the only thing I can stress is remember the R when purchasing accessories.  I don't recall if I picked the case due to it being suggested or if I found a case separately.  What I can say is the case I have doesn't cover the cameras as well as it would, and the power button doesn't sit well in the fitting on the case.  I reviewed my orders and saw the case was for a OnePlus 12 and not a OnePlus 12R.  That being said, it was probably my fault and I ordered a new 12R case and will eat the loss on the first case.  Not a big deal.  Battery drains significantly faster than my previous phone, but it was a powerhouse (Ulefone Power Armor 18T), so my basis for comparison is quite a bit larger/longer lasting.  The processing power and speed is way up from the Ulefone though.  Ultimately happy with my purchase.  This phone is wafer thin and insanely light compared to the Ulefone as well.  I do kinda miss the heft and insanely bright torch!","March 20, 2024"
205,OnePlus 12R 8GB,Eduardo Lopez,5,"There is nothing I dislike about this phone. One of the things that blows my mind is how fast you can fully charge the battery, put the battery in smart charge mode, expand the RAM memory without the need to buy a RAM memory card, and the built-in speakers. Apparently somebody was thinking outside of the box when this phone was in development. They understood the critical importance of battery life and performance along with RAM memory. For instance I expanded my RAM memory from 16 gigabytes of RAM to 24 gigabytes of RAM by simply sliding the slider switch in the settings and what a huge difference it made. No freezing up of any apps, quick responses when launching an app or apps etc.Although this phone does not have a memory card slot such as an SD card slot for external storage it more than makes up for that and you can get around that easily: You can share your files or photos very easily by 1. Transfer them using Bluetooth from or to your computer or another phone. 2. Tether to your computer or utilize NFC. This phone has two SIM card slots meaning if you want to add another number for business use you can do that without having to buy an extra phone - what a real convenience and money saver.This phone is very intuitive and informative on many levels. The weight and feel is very nice and the appearance. There are a lot of hidden features and tricks within this phone. When the phone's battery is in smart charging mode and I highly recommend that the phone will record your charging habits thereby increasing the battery life based on your charging habits. In case you're wondering it only takes half an hour to fully charge the phone. I end by repeating my words are not adequate enough on how awesome this phone is for the price. Is it worth the price? ABSOLUTELY! Way to go Nord!","July 1, 2024"
206,OnePlus 12R 8GB,Jeremy Hargens,5,"The wifes phone being 4 years old wasn't cutting the mustard to say. Battery was shot so it was time to retire the note 20.  I opted to get her this model.  I own the 12 she didn't want the giantic screen. So the 12r was the same size as her old note.Without me going after a day or two. Actually a whole week, she flat said the battery lasts all day, pictures are 10x better and it charges in like two seconds. And everything is just faster.  She has been super impressed with it.Owning now the 12 (me) and 12r (her). You honestly can't go wrong.If you asked me whats the biggest difference is of the two the 12 camera is far better. BUT the 12R can hold it's own and takes amazing shots. The detail and saturation is wonderfull. She even took some video at our son track meet. Said I can't belive how clear the video is and you can here all the sounds. And on a personal side note here the 12r is superrrr easy when it comes to shots and video recording. Can I tell the speed difference in the two nope they are both just as fast.If this is what the one plus has to offer and these hold up ill stick with one plus phones.And the os system is little different but my wife is not a tech person at all. She figured the thing out pretty quick which surprised me and even our teenage son. Ha!!So if your one the fence buy one. In a nut shell you get more bang for your buck.Oh and she's loves the alert slider and finger print sensor.Guys these phones are bad a**","May 18, 2024"
207,OnePlus 12R 8GB,Norman A Sims,5,"This is my first OnePlus phone, and I came from a Google Pixel 7 pro. So my expectations were high for this phone. I'd say it definitely exceed my expectations. Quality and finish of this product is top level. The signal of reception and wifi I get is of the charts. Way better than the old phone I had. Charging is top of the level, my phone is able to charge from 2% to 90 in 45 minutes. Battery life is also a big factor. I get about 10 hours of battery life from 100% to 15% which is way better than my old phone. My Google Pixel 7 Pro only got 7 and 30 minutes of battery life. Which three hours is three hours. The display is also very high quality for 1080p. Very snappy, colors are vibrant and the addition of this display supporting HDR10+ and Dolby Vision is amazing at this price point. OxygenOS 14 is also above average but I do which they had some of the options of the Google Pixel system options. The speakers are also great, the support of Dolby Atmos does the job of keeping everything sounding amazing. I would definitely be buying more products from OnePlus and recommending to people that are looking for a new phone.","July 12, 2024"
208,OnePlus 12R 8GB,ja,5,"Ok so this might be a little long but the backstory of what led me to this phone is important. I had been an iPhone user for a decade and I recently upgraded to a 2024 Razr Plus because I was getting bored of iOS and wanted to see what Android was like. I had that phone for about a week and while it had a lot of cool features, a lot of things just didn't work properly. Also the cameras are pretty bad on that thing. Since I was in my 14 day window I was able to return it but since they already took my 14 Pro as a trade in, I needed a backup phone to use temporarily until the iPhone 16 Pro comes out mid-September.I saw the OnePlus 12R and didn't really know much about it since America tends to only really talk about what Apple, Samsung, and Google put out. So I ordered the phone and when it got here a few days ago I headed into T-Mobile to return the Razr and activate the 12R. The employees were enamored by the 12R and raved about OnePlus as a brand and wished they still carried those phones.It's now been 3 days since I've activated the 12R and I am completely in love with this phone. Everything just works properly. It's a night and day experience over the Razr which also costs over double what this phone is. This is no longer a temporary phone until the iPhone comes out. I'm not switching back. I'm ready to dive fully into the OnePlus ecosystem. I just can't believe a phone this cheap operates almost entirely at a flagship level.When the OnePlus 13 comes out in December, I'll be getting it day one.","September 2, 2024"
209,OnePlus 12R 8GB,Johan M,5,"I was forced to switch back to a Google Pixel 6a due to unfortunately losing my N200. Was waiting to see what deals would arise from the OnePlus options and keyed in on this phone at $400 (which then dropped to $350 on Prime Day) and wow is it awesome.Definite flagship feel. Screen brightness and color are great, doesn't overheat like the Pixel, good connectivity on AT&T in a variety of areas (urban and wild, state-to-state) and is snappy regardless of multitasking. I love the OnePlus OS too—clean like Pixel but better gestures and sophisticated feel; major reason I came back. I'm an unusual modern phone user in that photo quality doesn't bother me but it is a few years lagging behind Samsung/Apple.Big Plus!: it charges super fast with the included charger. I charge it only during the day for about an hour or so a day and it never dies! I was always the guy heh-heh-ing that I forgot to charge my phone at night so I was battery budgeting. Never again! I just plug it in for 10 minutes and get enough charge for most outings.If you're not looking for a gaming phone, top-tier camera, or Apple then this is a best deal phone.","September 2, 2024"

Heavy use days it gets to about 15% but always lasts through the dayMore than 8 hrs straight of video useThe badThe phone is quite slippery out of the box. Looks fantastic but is unrealistically slippery. You'll need to buy a coverIts hanged on 2 apps over the 3 months I've had it : Gmail and YouTube but you can still switch around apps and kill them very quickly. Problem disappeared once the app was restartedCamera at night (in the dark)  isn't great but if you're not too serious about taking photos at night you won't notice it. During the day though the picture quality is 🔥Not much else is bad about this phone. Feels like a significant upgrade from my previous phone. A Samsung Galaxy S21,"August 11, 2024"
211,OnePlus 12R 8GB,Frank H,5,"The OnePlus 12R is an outstanding smartphone that delivers on all fronts. The performance is lightning-fast, thanks to the powerful processor, and the battery life easily lasts me through the day with heavy usage. The display is vibrant and crisp, perfect for watching videos or gaming. The camera setup is also impressive, capturing clear and detailed photos in any lighting condition. Plus, the sleek design and premium build quality make it feel like a top-tier device. All of this at such a competitive price point makes the OnePlus 12R a fantastic value. Highly recommended!","September 1, 2024"
212,OnePlus 12R 8GB,Its easily the,5,"This OnePlus 12R is the best phone I have ever owned. I had purchased a Pixel 7 after my iPhone started giving me grief, and the battery was draining quickly. The Pixel 7 had issues, so I purchased an off brand phone, which had to be returned as well as the Moto G Stylus 5G I purchased.I couldn't decide between the OnePlus 12 and the OnePlus 12R, but I went with the 12R since it was more than $200 less. I'm not sorry.This phone charges quickly, the battery is long-lived, and the screen is extremely responsive even with a screen protector. It also takes awesome photos.I highly recommend it to everyone. And it sure beats paying $1500 for a new iPhone.","August 11, 2024"
213,OnePlus 12R 8GB,GuessMe,4,"The device is a solid device and very good value for money, maybe the best value for money within this price range.

Those are my only cons about the device.","September 5, 2024"
214,OnePlus 12R 8GB,Brette OConnell,5,I bought a 512gb SD card to back it up but it does come with a USB converter so you can plug an HDMI card reader into your phone and scan files which I thought was pretty cool.

216,OnePlus 12R 8GB,Jason,5,"Compré este OnePlus 12R por la gran calidad - precio del mismo, es una belleza este dispositivo por todo lo que ofrece, desde el procesador (Snapdragon 8 gen 2 es el segundo procesador más potente de Qualcomm hasta la fecha de este comentario) que solo lo podíamos encontrar en teléfono más caros del año pasado y ahora se puede obtener por 500$ en su versión más económico sin contar los impuestos, contiene una cámara cumplidora y de muy buena calidad combinado de su hermosa pantalla de 6,7 pulgadas con unos tonos increíble, viene con 120hz y las pantallas curvas que a mí personalmente me fascinan. Lo que más me gustó fue su increíble batería que rinde muchísimo, me quedé muy asombrado porque me dura 10h intercalando entre juegos pesados como solo leveling, Minecraft RTX, emuladores de nintendo switch y aplicaciones multimedia como Netflix, Crunchyroll y YouTube. Para solamente esperar 25 minutos aproximadamente para tener 100% de batería nuevamente y aprovechar lo máximo este dispositivo, estoy muy encantando con este teléfono y lo puedes usar literalmente para lo que desees, jugar, mirar videos, edición y mucho más.","July 11, 2024"

No complaints at all. If this is the cheaper version, the normal 12 probably ridiculous.Everything feels great, UI and menus and such are nice and snappy. The refresh rate on the screen is great.

Then you can go back and ""enable"" the Google app again.If the Google page then comes back, as it did on my phone, repeat that process but then go back into Settings, go to ""Home Screen and Lock Screen"", then select "" Lock Home Screen layout"". That prevents any changes to the home screen and should get rid of the Google page for good.But that's the only thing about this phone I've disliked. Otherwise, it's a dream, especially considering the price. If you're on the fence about it, just get it!","July 7, 2024"
222,OnePlus 12R 8GB,LI Girl,4,"I had a OnePlus 7T Pro McLaren before this one so am familiar with their product. This one is a step up from that one. It's okay and it does what I need, which is make phone calls, text, and play the occasional game of solitaire. I did not like that the screen protector was already scratched when I received it and I have been told unless I take it to OnePlus (where are they in America?) to get that replaced, it will void my warranty. Really? So I have deducted a star for that nonsense. It's also pretty heavy if talking for awhile and holding up to my ear.","July 9, 2024"
223,OnePlus 12R 8GB,David H,4,Satisfied most of the time. I don't recall any reviews mentioning that the phone freezes up when using Gmail.

However the prices for the phones are more than my rent at this point. So I watched some reviews on this, it seems like a pretty good buy. So far I can't complain, I absolutely love it. The OS is nice, it's snappy, and didn't cost my 1k. Camera is pretty good as well. Overall well worth looking into, and switching over your stuff is easy. Also, to note this works on AT&T.","July 24, 2024"

The charger it is amazing how fast it is. My few criticisms are the enormous camera bump on the back of the phone and the fingerprint reader is not always being very accurate. To minimize the camera bump, I always use a case that helps minimize it. I hope an update will help with the fingerprint reader accuracy.","August 1, 2024"

235,OnePlus 12R 8GB,Sam,3,"The OS is apparently a hybrid of Android and Oxygen.  The OS changes the settings without any notice or rationale.  I rebooted hoping that might resolve it but made it worse.  It deleted many folders I had created. Changed other folders from square to round.  Removed the permanent apps usually found on the home screen task bar.  On the home screen I would swipe right to view news information.  Now it opens a ""My Notes"" app, which I cannot uninstall or even find in the list of apps on the device, to force stop.  I was glad to find a non-Samsung phone, that offered a possible alternative to Android, but am beginning to regret it. Other less concerning issues are:  It will not display/play some videos or images from some news feeds or social apps. One reboot it got hung up in the boot-up process.  For about five minutes it displayed a red dot with two white dots orbiting the red dot.  I was finally able to perform another reboot to get it out of that cycle.","August 14, 2024"

I was always a die hard Samsung guy but this phone made me a believer. Very nice, very happy with the purchase.

255,OnePlus 12R 8GB,Jaaz,3,"I think this phone is better than some offerings I've seen and YES this works on some U.S carriers. I tried it on Mint which uses Tmobile and got 315 MBs in Pocatello, Idaho. U.S mobile you can use either Tmobile or Verizon and it worked for me using a sim card. However, if you ask for support in message they will say they don't. I have an activated Verizon-based SIM I use in my Samsung Z-FLIP 4 that I swapped to the 12R to see if it works it does and I get good speeds just not Tmobile speeds so yes it works but you won't have tech support for it not to mention  U.S mobile tech is kinda sketchy anyways. Cricket you can pretty much forget about as they want to sell you proprietary devices as well as the Big Three Verizon, Tmobile, and ATT. I think on the other MVNO's the sim will work without tech support E-sims are out for now.If you go purely by specs and forget about wireless charging it is one of the better phones that has just ok cameras. The one thing I think tech reviewers have ignored but is a major part of a user is ECO-SYSTEM. Gemini makes me scream for Bixby or even Alexa the AI is so biased and untruthful. The messaging sucks.There is no theme store or font, etc. In the photo above you see a copy of a theme from Samsung that it brought over when it copied my phone. This phone has some nice features such as a nice screen I leave it in Vivid mode. Samsung forces you to buy the Ultra to get this type of screen. For me, the fast charging is cool , but seems kind of bull you have to get the 12 at a much higher price to get wireless. The apps run fast and you get three years of OS updates and 4 years of security. I think in three months when this is paid off I'm giving it to my kid and getting myself a Samsung 23 FE.","March 6, 2024"

After a lot of YouTube reviews being watched, and the alternatives not looking too good, I took the leap.  It is an amazing phone.  The only thing not so amazing is the rear camera.

294,OnePlus 12R 8GB,Tony Crosco,2,"There was a lot to like about this phone. It was fast, the battery life was pretty good, although not as great as the reviews I read led me to believe. The phone really does charge from 0-100 in 30 minutes. It was amazing. They do give you the option to remove items from your status bar to prevent screen burn or just to customize to your liking, which was helpful.  But there were some things I didn't like. There is no always on display. It just turns on when you move your phone. But it's not ""always on.""  The facial recognition works great, but I could not get it to read my fingerprints properly. It was very frustrating.  I also tried to transfer some photos  to my computer and was unable. The One Plus folder kept freezing on my laptop. I've never had this happen with any other phone. But the deal breaker for me was that one plus does not allow users to customize the Do Not Disturb feature. I turned my notification slider to the silent position and turned on do not disturb and an alarm still went off in the middle of a meeting. I called one plus customer service and was told that they do not allow any alarms to ever be silenced on their phones. You have to go into your alarm app and silence it from there. Even trying to lower the volume to zero is impossible. You can still hear the alarm on the lowest setting. I tried using do not disturb, the notification slider, and the Zen mode app. Nothing worked. This phone isn't super expensive, but it costs enough for me to be able to expect to silence my phone if I want to do so. Returning!! This was my first time trying a OnePlus phone. Until they change that feature, I will not be trying them again.","March 26, 2024"

299,OnePlus 9 Winter,Tony,5,"This phone is honestly great. Unlocked for your phone carrier and you could also unlock the bootloader too and root, install custom roms etc. I bought this at the time since it was one of the last oneplus phones that gave customers access to msm tools which allows you to restore your phone if you somehow mess up installing custom roms. The phone is fast, amoled screen looks nice and crisp. The snapdragon 888 processor is fast but it does heat up. I've rooted the phone and simply underclock it so it actually stays nice and cool all the time and even extends the battery life.If you're deciding between an older flagship and a midrange phone, I think pretty much you're always going to get a better deal with an older flagship (betters specs) unless you need a specific feature from a budget phone like sd card or phone jack.My only real complaint about this phone is the in-display fingerprint reader. It's not as fast as back fingerprint readers but I can't blame oneplus as android a whole has moved towards using in-display finger readers. Also if your thumb is slightly wet then it likely won't read your fingerprint.","September 27, 2023"
300,OnePlus 9 Winter,Stephan Kokinda,5,"very solid phone, works on cricket as you would expect considering cricket is running on at&t towers being a subsidiary i.e. owned by at&t. it has a really great camera in my opinion, and yes it comes with 65w fast charger out of the box a nice touch(samsung eat your heart out, or rip it out coz you don't do that) coming from being an iPhone user for many years, i do really like this phone. it's fast and so far no issues at all the display is great much better than the 60 hz found on iPhone (iPhone needs to step up their game) really not much else to say here, i do wish android would not have so many services that you cant remove without rooting. but most can be overlooked for now by disabling them. only down side to the switch is listed below i don't like getting notifications for everything by default i hope android changes this in the future to only display notifications for messages and calls it is a bit annoying having the phone buzz off for things you could care less about and as i stated below it's tedious to have to go into settings and shut off notifications for over 40 apps but is a fault of the android operating system itself. it does have some of what i consider bloatware but most can be uninstalled and some like the unwanted google stuff can only be disabled would like to see that change like google play movies/music and google photos stick them with a pipe just disable and get yourself vlc player and you are good to go.some things i don't like are just having to shut off notifications on a large amount of apps but that's all android based phones not a huge issue but annoying and time consuming and also shutting off permissions to apps that you don't want having access to camera, contact, microphone, LOCATION and other things you may not want some apps or services having access too but again all androids have this issue","August 3, 2021"
301,OnePlus 9 Winter,Tony,4,"Full disclosure I enjoy the more pure Android eco-system. Having read about One Plus Oxygen being an open source port of Android that gets pretty good reviews I decided to go for the One Plus 9 5G. My carrier is Google Fi, and I was so disappointed they started selling Samsung phones, of which I'm not a fan at all.First thing I noticed after purchasing it was the fit and finish is quite nice. It's not a brick, not svelte per se, but it has a good weight to it. The width was a welcome change from the Pixel 3XL. That minor reduction in width made this much more capable as a single hand phone. I'm not one to really care about fingerprints but you will get fingerprints all over the back and the face...again, whatevs.The speed. Out of the gate, when I dropped my Google Fi sim into the device the first thing I noticed was the speed. This is a fast tight phone. Which I do appreciate. Especially since my Pixel was on it's last legs and I really did need a replacement that would be a decent upgrade.If you purchase the unlocked version you should be aware of a few settings so your coverage is taking advantage of both WiFi calling/data, and roaming. Which sort of leads me to believe that since you have to make those adjustments in the settings menu. I wonder how many people have purchased the phone and thought, damn my coverage is awful with this thing.  So, I ding them for that....but then, this isn't a on and done purchase. You have to do a bit of finagling with the hardware. Welcome to Android....lol.Charging. WOW...just WOW. I have a 15w wireless charger I used with my Pixel and it charges the One Plus 9 5G...just fine....and...not sure I get why people complain about the wireless charging but in my experience it's just fine. At work I charge it connected to a docking station and.....it's FAST. And that's using my Pixel charging cable.Battery life. I don't think this is intended as a battery sipper. it will go through a full charge in a day. With some room to spare. But overall I wasn't dismayed by the battery life. I've tested it with the various and NUMEROUS battery life extension settings on the phone, some of which are confusing...again...welcome to Android. But I like playing around with stuff like this;Camera. Love it. It's great. I've literally taken shots with my Pixel that I regard as stunning. And in the few weeks I've had the One Plus 9 5G, can't complain at all. If anything, I've noticed a depth of color in both wide  and closer shots that feels more realistic and to be honest I'm kind of shocked at how well the camera works compared to the Pixel 3XL, which...I really loved that camera, a lot. The interface is quite different but it's responsive and the level of tweeking you can do to get your shot is miles apart from the Pixel.What's not so great: Well, on the second week I scratched the screen, Just above the fingerprint sensor. I had it in my pocket with some keys, my bad, and I was kind of surprised it scratched so easily. I've had my Pixel for over 3 years, handling the exact same way and I never experienced that. The screen never had any wear at all. The scratch isn't bad, you can only see it if you look at it at an angle. But still. This concerns me.Fingerprint sensor: hit or miss. It's built into the front of the screen, which is nice. But, it takes multiple tries to unlock, and if your fingers are particularly dry, or just off from the sensor. Yes, you'll get a warning and have to enter your pin after so many tries. To be honest, this doesn't bother me that much. But it has been an annoyance a few times.Choices!: There's a LOT to play with in the settings, for me not a big deal at all, for others....gives me pause. Not sure I'd recommend this phone to someone not into having fun with the settings. Or a person that just wants to turn it on a go.File transfers to Mac: It'd be nice if I could connect the phone to my mac to transfer files. The phone automatically offers a USB driver to install when you connect it to a PC. Not so much with a Mac. There was an article on the One Plus website about enabling developer mode so you could enable USB logging so you could do file transfers....tried it, didn't work. Not a deal breaker but.....again, not the most user friendly experience.Conclusion: I like the phone, and I think it'll serve me for what I need it to do. Speed, durability and camera. 5G coverage where I'm at is, spotty, but, have noticed a speed boost when it does show up in the top menu bar...which again...wow, LOADS of icons in the top home screen menu bar...it's kinda funny. And Camera, I used my camera phone on my Pixel all the time. If this phone's camera was lackluster or a compromise I would have sent it back fast.  But from what I've experienced, especially the camera interface, I have a lot to play with and for that I'm excited.","August 16, 2021"
302,OnePlus 9 Winter,antonio,5,"I've had the phone a bit over a month now and I'm very happy with it so far. Came sealed new in box. Top notch quality at a very affordable price. The only real complaint I have is that there is no expandable microsd storage, but 128Gb internal is enough to get me by and it's pretty fast. Also no headphone jack, but can't really knock it for that with everyone else doing the same, still very frustrating not having it when you need it even as an audio enthusiast with multiple DAC choices. Very happy to find a good phone like this with a flat screen so I can use a regular glass screen protector and not lose touch sensitivity or the finger print reader without UV glue or a circle on the sensor, even came with a self healing TPU screen protector pre-applied.I was pretty pleased with OxygenOS as is, though I mainly got this phone so I could install custom ROMs and it was a breeze getting LineageOS on it. And even when I tweaked somthing in the ROM that I shouldn't have and it stopped booting, the factory reset process was simple and straight forward. Activated through Verizon with no issues on LineageOS.","June 15, 2023"

305,OnePlus 9 Winter,Amazon Customer,5,"Went up from 6T as it wasn't switching to mobile network from WiFi or sometimes not even connecting on Google Fi network. This one works just fine.Once you experience how fast this one charges, everything else is going to be frustrating.While I am mostly happy with the overall experience, a few camera related things bother me.1. Pro mode supports only the main camera. Why not the wide angle? You can't zoom either.2. You can't set the high resolution mode as default. The default resolution is only 12 Mega pixels! Why? Edit.. you can, after the latest update.3. The panorama mode has been improved and is much smoother. However it doesn't take advantage of the wider camera. You can't choose the camera/lens either. If you install GCam, it will give you a wider(or higher)more pixels.4. In pro mode if you adjust certain parameters and leave the rest floating, the shutter speed won't go down below a limit to compensate(unless you adjust that also manually.5. You can't zoom in in portrait mode. Why?6. The stabilization rocks(but the video is cropped compared to the photos).Lost the ability to set dark mode for individual apps with the last update.Also the Bluetooth randomly connects and disconnects if there is nothing playing.","July 19, 2021"
306,OnePlus 9 Winter,Stephan Kokinda,3,"Overall a good phone.5G on T-Mobile only, if even. Not on AT&T.Camera(s) use EIS - image stabilization in software. The issue is that EIS is only in the included camera software. Using other apps to capture pics/videos do not get any image stabilization. E.g. Open Camera and dash-cam apps. This is a step back from my older phones (OnePlus 6, OnePlus 7 Pro).Good wide-lens camera, no optical zoom camera.Battery life is good, especially after Android 13 update. I get two days with moderate use.Battery gets warm during charging - not good for its life. I have to pay attention (use AccuBattery) and disconnect the charger at 80%. The phone has a optimized charging feature, but no way of stopping the charging before 100% and avoiding overheating. AccuBattery shows the battery health at 90% only already, after a couple of weeks of use. Not great prognosis for its life.We'll see how much longer OnePlus supports this phone with updates. I should have gotten a Google Pixel 6A at the same price. Somewhat lower specs but better pictures and much better/longer software support/updates.No video over USB C.

I was a long time Google Phone user (had the iPhone 4, Samsung S3, Samsung S4, Samsung S5, Moto X 2014, Nexus 5X, and Google Pixel 2 XL previously) since 2014 when Google owned Motorola. The camera is good, but deffo needs some software updates to make it even better. I love Oxygen OS because it's near stock android so it's an easy jump from my Pixel. So if you still have your Pixel, Pixel 2, or Pixel 3 and don't want to break the bank on your next phone then I'd recommend this.Something to keep in mind:The Samsung S21 is constantly on sale for around the price of this phone and it could be a hard sell if you're not into the software experience that OnePlus offers. Samsung packs a wee bit more features and specs for that price. So it really comes down the software experience you prefer.","April 29, 2021"

At this point since its LTE Im assuming its working properly, but im not sure if the problem still exist. I will update if anything goes wrong again.Other than the problem I described above, I think the overall quality of the phone is decent charging is super fast.BTW USA version OnePlus 9 do not support dual SIM.Edit：Internet problem seems fixed by itself， if anyone have the same issue just let the sim card sit in the phone for a few hours let it configure itself.

310,OnePlus 9 Winter,Stephan Kokinda,1,"In the past, I've really liked most of the OnePlus hardware, so this was a first bad experience with the brand for me.I experienced a lot of bugs and problems right out of the box with the OnePlus 9:  Phone running very hot while totally idle; short battery life; LTE signal half as strong as my OnePlus 6T (and lots of dropouts).I'm an experience software engineer and I spent hours trying to get the updater to work correctly.  It kept failing to download any full or incremental updates, crashing and exhibiting UI bugs.  It eventually managed to pull and install one large OTA update, rebooted.  I expected Android 12 or 13 afterwards, nope, still android 11, but now the phone partially thinks its a Global/EU model, despite the IMEI indicating a US region.It automatically started a new, smaller incremental OTA update, which soft-bricked the phone.  Yay.  I was able to recover it from fastboot, but only by manually flashing an OOS12 image OnePlus support gave me.  After getting it running again, it refused to update anymore, despite being one Android version, 10 months and ~6 incremental updates behind the current version.What happend?  Well, OnePlus has started merging OxygenOS and ColorOS codebases, which has been a bit of a disaster and resulted in a lot of the development community and users losing confidence in the last year or so.One of the most recent incremental OTA updates OnePlus pushed out around month ago bricked thousands of devices.  OnePlus pulled the update down a week or two later, but not after a lot of 9/9pro users suddenly lost access to their devices.  I'd recommend staying away from anything newer than an 8T until OOS is in a better state.","March 19, 2023"

The list goes on with little details that makes this phone worse than any of my past phones for things that I never even have to worry about.Ok, now the real reason I'm writing this review that makes me tell you DO NOT BUY THIS: this phone is hit by a bug that makes your used storage grow over time and there's nothing you can do about it other than rooting your phone and deleting yourself some system log or doing a factory reset of the phone.This makes the phone impossible to use, who's gonna wipe it out and reinstall every couple weeks?Search the internet, you'll find several posts about this bug, dating as far back as 2021 and latest upgrades still haven't resolved this.OnePlus lost me, I will never buy a phone from them again.","March 17, 2024"
313,OnePlus 9 Winter,lisa,4,"I had to change the telecom operator from metro by T-Mobile to at&t. The description stated that the phone was completely unblocked. It's very uncomfortable, plus it costs money. The phone itself is just amazing, especially after my Samsung a 32.","July 5, 2023"
314,OnePlus 9 Winter,lisa,4,"I've had this phone for a year and a half, and it's fantastic. Very fast, good battery life, and it charges incredibly quickly even while being used. Really, my only complaints are that you can't expand the storage (REALLY wish I had paid extra for the 256 gb storage), and because it's an AMOLED screen you might get burn-in, like I did. I spend a lot of time browsing the internet, and now my tab icon, url bar, etc are permanently burnt into the screen.","December 20, 2022"

319,OnePlus 9 Winter,Tony,5,"Crazy phone. It can make phone calls and BOTH send AND receive SMS!!! Amazing!!!Jokes aside, GREAT headset! Super reactive, 120 Hz screen makes it sooo smooth! It's my first One+ after having heard so good of it, and I am not disappointed at all! Pretty cool custom features, both graphical and functional (I won't spoil it for you!). I love the reverse wireless charging feature: game-changer! The battery life seems amazing and there are so many functions to manage it. The only down-side is a one-sim card only and there isno expansion SD slot. Cameras are not to the level of the iphone13 but are very good, considering the difference in price! Totally recommended! If it doesn't disappoint me (as ZTE did recently) I will give them my loyalty for long!","January 6, 2022"

321,OnePlus 9 Winter,Enrico Calzavara,3,"The video and camera features were not well implemented. Don’t buy if you’re getting it for the camera.Highest video setting is automatically set resulting in a 5 min max video unless you change the settings every time you bring up your video. The video also does not transfer well to other media players. The video quality looks glitchy, blurry, shakey, etc.Also.. there is no pro B&W setting, which I found odd. Besides the camera and video settings and faults, the phone is good. But it felt pointless being an Android with the capabilities of taking great video and photos, but not being easily able to. Default video sizes and photos never matched up either. The setting options for the video is just awful.Absolutely no bloat ware. Good job Oneplus, that’s amazing. Hasselblad came through, but Oneplus falls short with real focusing on the cameras capabilities.Charges very quick with charger that comes with it. The temperature was also another problem I ran into with this phone.","September 12, 2021"

323,OnePlus 9 Winter,jake,4,"Overall, I like the phone but the battery life isn't as long as I would have liked. Also, I have issued with the fingerprint reader frequently.

324,OnePlus 9 Winter,Fernando D,2,"***OnePlus is throttling performance in the most used apps***I've been a OP user for several years. I was waiting for the OP9 model new cameras, as this has been traditionally the ""compromise"" on previous models.I've read about the battery & heat issues reported by several users at product launch. But it seems that was  already addressed by recent updates. So I decide to buy it.Unfortunately OP has resorted to throttling apps to tackle these battery/heat issues. IMO, this is just not acceptable. Pls google ""OnePlus throttling"" and you'll find a tons of reports of this.According to the news, this throttling affects not just Chrome, but all the apps that I use for work. I couldn't believe it. So I run a test against OP5T. The results are staggering. The OP9 is way more sluggish than a 4 years old model. See the attached pictures with the benchmark results.So if you buy for the performance of the Snapdragon 888, you'll not get it (as of time of this review). If you can live with that, you'll getting a great screen and good camera package. Who knows, they may be do another FW upgrade and give the user the option to ""performance"" or ""battery""Consider it carefully before buying.","July 9, 2021"
325,OnePlus 9 Winter,K Karau,5,"The quick charge is awesome, especially considering that it's a 4,500 millith amp hour battery! Fastest change I've ever seen..... I've got TMobile, and the 5G speed is good. Not as quick as I was expecting, like not jaw-dropping, but really good, and it's more consistent than 4G LTE. Easy to transfer data from my Google pixel to the 9 5G. Sensitivity of the phone is good, haven't taken too many pictures, but I took a few from outside that look nice. Surprised that even with multiple apps open, watching stocks on Webull and Robinhood, the phone doesn't get hot. That's indoor use though, if I was using it outside in the heat that might change. Altogether though, this phone's a definite recommend from me. Comes with a kind of cheap prefit screen protector that gets surface scratched pretty easily, but that's probably my only negative point.","June 25, 2021"
326,OnePlus 9 Winter,A Scott,1,"This OnePlus 9 is my first OnePlus phone.The REALLY BAD:- It has a ""Game Space"" app that functions as spyware, that cannot be removed, even on phones that have no games installed.- With each update the Game Space app gives itself more permissions that are not necessary for games, including sending emails with calendar and contact information to unknown users without your permission.  (see pictures)- The app claims that these permissions can be changed, but the controls to turn them off are greyed out and non-functional.- OnePlus's response is to say ""DON'T LOOK AT THE APP"".- There was one OnePlus response that said they were going to fix it in the next android update.  It is the only reason I did not return the phone.The ANNOYING:- The battery lasts less than half a day with heavy use.  That is about the same as a 5 year old phone with a battery half the size.- This mandates that you carry a charger or power bank and a cable.- The quick charge feature is proprietary, only OnePlus chargers will use it.  The difference between 2- hours charging and a half hour charging.The GOOD:- The quick charge with the OnePlus charger does exactly what it says.  It charges really fast.- The screen response is smooth.- The 5G connectivity of the U.S. model works with T-Mobile.  The international version with dual sims does not.- The camera app seems intuitive - for someone with no camera skills like myself.In a nutshell:  If they don't make the spyware removable with the next android update, it will be my last OnePlus phone.","September 3, 2021"
327,OnePlus 9 Winter,A Scott,4,"I really liked this phone. It had a smooth screen and vivid colors. It was very responsive and I loved that it had the do not disturb rocker switch. Only bad thing was the price. It was over $700 for the basic phone, not the pro. I wish I kept it but I listened to the hype around the pixel 6. The pixel was also almost $200 less so I went in that direction. Hindsight is 20/20. Bad decision.","January 29, 2022"
328,OnePlus 9 Winter,K Shen,5,"It's hard to get everything you want in a phone. This phone is technically not water proof and that is a huge thing for me as I've always had waterproof phones. OnePlus made cuts here and there to make this one more affordable, so it is overall a great buy if you are looking for a good phone for less than Samsung. I contemplated getting the S21 (1 year after release) and that is almost $800. This phone is straight out of the show room for less than that.Oneplus has always had great specs and performance. The one thing they lacked was the camera quality which seems to be much better. I had returned the 7t because of the weird colors, but the colors are fine with this phone from what I can tell in my one month of use.","May 26, 2021"

Gaming and app response is incredible. I recently switched carriers and the OP9 didn't support Xfinity. I thought I was getting an upgrade by switching to pixel 6, I was so wrong. The fingerprint sensor almost never works and there is no face unlock. The pixel is extremely glitchy and slow, that is compared to my OnePlus 9.

The OnePlus 9 has a lot of huge upgrades compared to my old phone as one would expect, but what was most important to me was my ability to get it and go with no learning curve. I've found it to be just that. Easy to transition because the software is almost stock android. A little bit more buggy for sure, but overall its been great so far.","October 1, 2021"

348,OnePlus 9 Winter,Richard,2,"Bought the phone because of OnePlus reputation for phones with almost native Android, the warp charger and wireless charging. But it did not charge wirelessly despite the claim on the Amazon listing It's confusing since OnePlus makes this phone with and without wireless charging depending on the market and the US is one with wireless charging.The model with wireless charging is LE2115 which is displayed when you go into the phone settings. But the stickers on the outside said LE2110 which the model without wireless charging. It's almost like somebody flashed the LE2115 ROM on a LE2110 phone except the phone came in what looked like genuine OnePlus retail packing with stickers, screen protector and case.Because the phone charges so quickly and not sure if another would be the same decided to keep the phone but Amazon gave me a $120 credit for the incorrect information on the listing.","August 26, 2022"

When you check the details in Settings, it will tell you it’s a LE2115.  The main physical difference between the two is that the US Version has Wireless charging and the Asian Version does not.- And the whole security issue thing.I had to send it back after spending an afternoon updating it.If you don’t have an issue with using the Asian Version of this phone, then it’s more than equal to the previous year’s old top tier Samsung phones.- But don’t sell the Asian Version, which may have security issues, and claim that it’s the US Version.","January 5, 2023"

Typing was nearly impossible because it would skip letters, I'd have to press hard on each letter, and I'd have to hold each letter for longer than necessary. After restoring the factory settings it refused to turn off at all. It's just going to have to die in the return packaging.Customization was also garbage. I couldn't set up my folders and icons the way I wanted. I couldn't set different sounds for different notification types.

399,OnePlus Open 16GB,Amazon Customer,5,"So about a month ago I decided it was time to finally break away from the apple eco system. I was sick of it. I really liked the refined design of the fold 6 and knew I wanted something that felt vastly different from a candy bar form factor.The phone was great and had a lot of features that wowed me. The AI tools were fun and silly and the screens were bright and vibrant. I got blue bubbles working at home and thought I was good to go.A week passed and I realized I wasn't in love. That damn front screen is just so narrow. I have little hands. I'm a small guy. I didn't think it would bother me. I couldn't type a sentence on it to save my life. The cases for it added such a strange cheap bulky feeling to the phone and made me feel like I was carrying around a TV remote. The inner screen was so damn glossy, I couldn't see outside or even in my apartment for that matter because it reflected EVERYTHING around me and was covered in smudges in an instant. You can't set the phone down flat on a table because of the camera placement. It was also uncomfortable to hold with those sharp corners.The one plus open has fixed all of those issues for me. The inner screen feels so much more premium and the outer screen is a perfect size. I love the anti glare inside and can't get over how shallow the crease is. I honestly even like the OS more. Coming from iOS, it's a little more inviting. Of course I miss the wireless charging and AI features, but I can absolutely live without those. The cameras are so much better and I prefer the more tasteful image processing. Samsung pics look like an acid trip, they're so oversaturated. The OnePlus open feels so much more premium and carefully crafted. I also don't really need these phones to be much thinner...I like how solid the open feels. I don't feel like it's going to break every time I unfold it. While it may not be snapdragon 8 gen 3, gen 2 runs extremely well. Battery life is absolutely better even at high performance.So happy to join the OnePlus ecosystem. Such a brilliantly balanced device.","August 7, 2024"
400,OnePlus Open 16GB,Dimitri,5,"I have owned  the Samsung  Z Fold 3, 4, and 5. There were so few substantial changes in those releases that I sold the Z Fold 5 within three months of ownership. I never enjoyed using the outer screen for anything, especially if I needed to enter data, because it was too narrow. The cameras were too much of a downgrade from their S-series phones. Although they had pen support, carrying one required a thicker case on an already large and heavy phone. I wear pants with large pockets, but the long skinny foldable would occasionally fall out while sitting down.While the Z Fold interface can be very good, there were too many duplicated apps that added little additional functionality, including their voice assistant. This unnecessarily increased overall complexity when using the phone.I also purchased the S24 Ultra with AI built in, but only for the Samsung apps. Since I don't use their browser, voice assistant, messaging, or mail I didn't have access to much AI on that phone. Plus, I had become accustomed to the larger inside screen and missed that part of the foldable experience.I then tried the Pixel Fold, but did not like its inability to easily lay flat, many apps did not display correctly on the large inside screen, it had heat issues when doing everyday things, and Google's pitiful history of pixel phone support (I have owned several early Pixel phones). I loved the outer screen aspect much better than the Z Fold.I read several reviews for the OnePlus Open that were so good I purchased one and these are my notes so far.Pros- the outer screen is the perfect height and width for typing with my larger thumbs- face unlock is more accurate and faster- it is lighter than the Z Fold and much lighter than the Pixel Fold- it charges in 42 minutes from 0%, so I do not miss or need wireless charging- its larger battery lasts longer than the Z Fold 5- while I am not a phone camera expert, my pictures are noticably better- the interface is much simpler and streamlined with minimal app duplication- I am surprised how much I like their Open Canvas multi-tasking implementation- the crease on the phone is much closer to being invisible than all  Z Folds or the Pixel FoldCons- not water or dust proof, just splash resistant- not a wide selection of good cases","June 5, 2024"
401,OnePlus Open 16GB,Amazon Customer,1,"Bought my phone a few months ago. Opened it and my middle screen has a line of dead pixels. No dropping. No damage. Just the screen opening action was enough to break it. Have been trying to get support, got approved but when I try to click on details for my service request I get ""unavailable"" notification. Lots of reports online with hinge related inner screen damage. No drops of physical damage, just open your screen one day and boom. According to their documentation - it will take up to 3 weeks to repair. Great... My work requires 2FA - HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO DEAL WITHOUT MY PHONE FOR 3-4 WEEKS!?!? Anyway I would stay away from this brand. Google just sends you a replacement, you just ship your old phone in the shipping box and keep the new one... That's how a legitimate company handles it.Update. Even though I got approved for repairs - tech support claims there is no record of my support tickets and is now asking for proof of purchase and pictures. I literally have an approved page with my phone IMEI and a get more info button. Either their system is broken or they just don't want to fix all these defective phones.","August 21, 2024"
402,OnePlus Open 16GB,Larry A,5,"I have to say, I was surprised by this phone. Being a loyal Samsung user for over the last decade, I was conflicted between choosing this or the Fold 5. Eventually choosing this phone due to the better screen ratios and for One Plus's (technically) first folding phone and my first One Plus phone. Wow. Just wow.I've had the phone for around 3 days now and so far I have gotten multiple compliments. And while I can not recommend the phone currently due to the admittedly high prices of folding smart phones. I plan on recommending it when it assumedly drops in price when the next generation releases.Pros;• Perfect foldable screen aspect ratios.Unlike Samsung that insists on a thing outer folding screen in (an assumed) attempt to make people want to use the opened form of the phone. One plus instead offers a for normal outer screen. Not only meaning you can use it like a normal phone but also get a larger tablet from factor.• Invisible CreaseWhen the screen is folded open the crease is probably the best currently on the market. Unable to be seen unless held at angles that you would never even think of looking at the phone at unless you wanted to see the crease.• Battery LifeSo far I have only gotten below 50% battery after regular use of the phone in one day. That day being the first day I got the phone, when it arrived at 50% battery.• ChargingThis phone will charge FAST. I've put this charge at charge around 60% and came back 20-30 minutes later to see it fully charged.Cons;• PriceNow this is a problem with all main foldable phones currently on the market but yeah... I honestly can not see foldable becoming main stream until they are able to be brought down in price. Though that is probably still a few years off.• SoftwareNow this is not a dig at Oxygen OS as it so far feels like a good skin on the great Android OS. But some apps act weird when swapping between open and closed modes. Stretch long or squishing. I don't know if this is because these apps have only focused on working well on screen sizes similar to the Galaxy Fold but it is an issue where I sometimes have to close out of apps when swapping between screens just to not deal with awkward lay outs. Besides that though so far everything has been great.","April 6, 2024"
403,OnePlus Open 16GB,Dimitri,3,"This review will mostly be for people with current flagships looking to get into the foldable market, Iphone user for 10 years recently swtiched from a iphone 14 pro max to the Galaxy 23 ultra earlier this year and couldnt have been happier, but ive always had an itch to try out a foldable, so when i seen one plus coming out with one that was more on the normal side of a cover screen and incredible specs i thought id try it out, first impressions, build quality is crazy nice, feels great, lightweight very snappy open and close, and having never used a foldable before, the inner screen is insane, you will never notice the crease and its so hard to feel so major props to one plus for that, mostly everything you see on the youtube reviews is true so ill skip most of that, but the question that stands is it worth swtiching from a flagship, and the answer is no. Cover screen which you'll probably be using at least 60% of the time is just way to small still compared to the s23 ultra or an iphone pro max, software just isnt there yet either very laggy compared to other flagships, lots of apps dont work on the cover screen, but surprisingly work on the inner screen? Also apps that have either face id unlock or biometrics on Samsung and Apple dont exist on the one plus which is VERY frustrating, having to type in a password for an app everytime is annoying it doesnt even let you save it on there regardless if its with biometrics or not, and this isnt all apps its just some, just like some apps not fitting the cover screen or inner, just a few i ran across in my case, while we're on that note though, i will say one plus has the quickest biometrics ever, truly incredible, lastly their software ""phone clone"" sucks its absolutely nothing compared to apples or Samsungs and when switching brands like that it makes it so much easier and more convincing to do so and it was just so annoying swtiching all my stuff and settings over manually, so in conclusion its a great phone, incredible build quality, beautiful screens, amazing cameras, speakers are the best out there, switching from another foldable, probably worth, going from a flagship, probably not. while its a great phone, you're still giving up quite a few things, id love for foldables to be on par with flagships but we're just not there yet.","November 30, 2023"
404,OnePlus Open 16GB,Dimitri,5,"First - people either love ""fold"" cell phones or they hate them.  I love them.  I've used a couple of Samsung's Z Folds.  My only negative for the Samsung Z Fold is - when not folded - the screen is too narrow.  So when OnePlus announced they were going to have a Fold (Open) - I was excited.  Because they were coming out with one - and because it would get me back in the OnePlus family.  I had the original - OnePlus One, then 3, then 6, N200, then 9.For me there's no problem with their launcher/operating system - OxygenOS.  But I do flip between OOS and Microsoft Launcher because I like variety.  I did that with my Samsung phones too.  I like change.  What can I say.I like the feel in my hand.  I like that the front screen is wider - and when open the screen is bigger.  I like that there aren't a bunch of preinstalled stuff that you don't want to use - and some of which you can't uninstall.  OxygenOS is a pretty clean operating system - no unnecessary bloat - i haven't had to remove any apps.I am having an issue with making/receiving calls when WiFi is on - my cell provider (cough t-mob cough) just told me ""turn off WiFi"" which is them saying - it's not our problem.  And to be transparent - I had the same issue with with my cell provider branded Samsung Folds - no or spotted calls when WiFi was on - and got the same response from my provider - ""turn off WiFi.""  And yes - that does fix the sympton - not the root cause.I have reached out to OnePlus support - they responded very quickly - asked me for some information that my cell provider never asked.  So we shall see.  It's not a deal breaker for me because I have unlimited calls/text/data - so I can keep WiFi off.  Would be nice to have it on when I'm streaming music and video, etc.Anyhow - to wrap up - great phone - love how fast and clean it is - and love being back with the OnePlus family again.","November 30, 2023"
405,OnePlus Open 16GB,Jon C,4,"So, I wasn’t supposed to purchase a phone, let alone a foldable because I was a happy Surface Duo user, however, circumstances dictate for me to purchase a new foldable because my Duo slipped out of my pocket and dropped. At first, the screen was still responsive even though there were cracks all over it, but little by little the responsiveness declined. Luckily, OnePlus was released just in time I was looking for a new foldable. You are probably asking, why didn’t I have my Duo repaired? I would if I could, but I am currently living out of the US, and I cannot just send my device for repair. I will when I return state side.Why did I select OnePlus over the like of Samsung Fold and Pixel Fold. For one, I was looking for a phone that emulates the Surface Duo’s ability to multitask. After trying both devices, I decided to go with the OnePlus Open based on multiple reviews online on how it handles multiple apps at the same time. Granted, it is a leap of faith decision since where I am at, the foldable isn’t available at all – thanks Oppo!Now that I have had the phone for a month, I’m happy to say that I enjoy using the device and all its quirks. For one, the widgets are not expandable when you open the device. They are all on the left side of the screen, and you cannot move it in the center of the screen. It is not a deal breaker, but it would just be nice to see whatever widgets that’s on the front screen to be in the middle of the device when you unfold it.Microsoft Teams (school or work) is sometimes quirky with this device. When you tap to answer a notification while using both screens. The app for some reason has multiple sessions on the left side of the screen. You must navigate back close those sessions before you can respond.Luckily, from what I have read, Microsoft is giving love to this device, as it will bake the Link to Windows feature into the OS soon (Oxygen 14) – ala Samsung. I hope that Microsoft will work out some of the issues with MS Teams with the manufacturer as well.Now that the cons are out of the way, here is a list that I like about the device:Battery Optimizer - tells you when an app is draining the battery, and the battery last exceptionally longFast Charging - it is extremely fast when you use its charger!Weight - noticeably light compared to the rest of the foldables I've triedAnd of course, the camera, but that is a different topic!I am glad that I had that leap of faith and purchased this device, and for now, my Surface Duo 2 will take a rest.(I'm giving this device four stars for now, but I will update this review once Oxygen OS 14 is released. Maybe then, I can give it 5 stars.)Update: After receiving the latest Update for the device, the system is still marred with the same dual screen issue for some Apps. While functional, you can tell that it isn't natural for a foldable, as it tries to run the app in full screen. The same goes with Microsoft Teams as I mentioned above.Link to Windows is fully baked, and from what I can tell, it is functioning as it should.Keeping it at 4 stars.","December 30, 2023"

The only thing I thought I would miss is the stylus, but I have quickly forgotten about it as the open screen more than makes up for the niche use of it.  The speakers put out great quality sound.

410,OnePlus Open 16GB,Dimitri,2,"For context, I've been a long-time iPhone user, and I've been taking flack for it ever since I started working in tech. After doing research on the best folding phone I landed on this one.I think its a brilliant phone when it comes to the camera, screen and software features. Oxygen OS is amazing and I hate to admit it, but far superior to iOS in my humble opinion.That being said, customer support for this device is non-existent. My mother-in-law accidentally dropped my phone, and even though it was in a pretty rugged case, the internal screen got damaged. It's been over a month since I started the repair process with One Plus directly, and they told me today that they haven't even inspected it. On top of that, I called several phone repair shops here in Southern California, and they estimate they might have repair parts in a year.Which ultimately leads me to this:The fact that getting a device repaired is such a pain makes it completely impractical. I would rather have inferior hardware and software, but I know that if an accident happens or my device breaks, I can get it repaired or replaced quickly.","September 5, 2024"

The camera, responsiveness and multiple app software experience is much better.However I bought one when it first came out and in about one month the screen got a dead pixel that eventually went across the entire inner screen. My fold 2 & 3 both eventually had issues with the inner screen but they lasted at least a year before any issues.Normally getting a replacement would not be an issue but because this phone doesn't allow you to do a direct replacement I had to wait a whole month while it was rma until I eventually got it.And within two weeks the screen on the new phone went completely black and no longer turns on.So now I think I won't bother with the month long replacement.","May 10, 2024"
414,OnePlus Open 16GB,Lou,5,"I came from the Fold 3 after the 4 and 5 didn't offer much in way of basically anything different or special enough to upgrade however the Open peaked my interest. After buying and testing it for a week I can say with 100% certainly this is the best foldable. However it does have a couple flaws that take getting used to but I believe the feature and performance more than make up for it. The fingerprint reader is pretty small meaning it will definitely take about 2 trys before unlocking your phone due to it small scan area. 2. No wireless charging for me not a big deal but for some it's definitely a pain point. Lastly the volume buttons are way to high and I have big hands. Most of these are not picks though which is a good sign for the phone. Otherwise the cameras are nothing super special but fine they definitely need a good amount of light to get the perfect shot. The screens are bright and the crease is very very hard to see and you can barely feel it. But what made this phone different for me is the battery. Simply outstanding. All day battery on a foldable with very heavy use is truly remarkable and even if you manage to drain it, it charges at 67W with the included adapter meaning you can plug in your phone to to the bathroom come back and it may have 8 or 10 percent back leave it for 30mins and you're nearly full. Overall if you can stomach the price which is 100 less than the competition the buy this. All other choice pale in comparison.

415,OnePlus Open 16GB,Shannon M,3,"I wanted to love this phone.  Really, I did.  But, I don't.  The screen size is good both when closed (like a regular phone) and when open (like a small tablet).  But, the operating software itself is, to put it nicely, very buggy and I personally find the larger screen of limited use.  There just isn't enough software optimized for it to make it valuable.  That said, the stuff that is designed for it is really quite nice.Unfortunately, the camera ""bump"" is more like a mountain and is extremely obtrusive.  Like, really, really huge.  And what in the absolute **** is up with a phone in 2024 that does not have wireless charging built in???  Yes, the high-speed wired charging is great.  But not being able to simply top-up with your car's wireless charger or missing the convenience of just dropping it on a Qi charger when going to bed is absurd.  Absolutely no excuse for omitting it.Overall, a cool idea but not ready for prime time in my opinion.  I'll be going back to a Samsung flagship soon.","February 5, 2024"

I'm excited to learn more about the camera and haven't even begun to unleash the potential.  The value of this phone for the money is, so far, impressive.

I prefer Apple phones but they are more the same and aren't changing much  Defected this time from the 15 pro max (iPhone flagship phone) and actually enjoying the shift as the phone functions exactly as an online reviewer stated in that it is a great phone for someone wanting a functional foldable in both fold and unfoldable modes that also wants a fun phone that serves a lot of functions and roles at once. The negative reviews on here seem to be random, specific phone errors (that all phone types have) or perhaps they thought a foldable phone could be used like an old Nokia Brick phone and damaged the inner screen (hint: it's foldable glass, you can't be brutal which it)... If you want a foldable and a fun phone, this is probably your best option. If you want a phone that is near flawless as a normal touchscreen experience that hasn't really changed in years, go iPhone. I'm enjoying the shift though and will be finally be staying with an Android for more than a few months!","December 2, 2023"
421,OnePlus Open 16GB,Eric Formato,5,i've used many folding phones in the past and this is my favorite. it is far better than the  z fold 5 in so many ways.1. it is lighter and makes a huge dif for one handed use2. outside screen is larger and feels like a normal phone when folded. z fold screen is so narrow you are forced to open it every time and it becomes a chore3. crease less noticeable compared to samsung4. has faster charging with brick included in the box5. overall just flat out better value and experience compared to samsungi've been a huge samsung fan but oneplus is crushing it. i expect samsung to make some drastic changes with their z fold 6 to compete,"April 4, 2024"
422,OnePlus Open 16GB,Witchdoctor,5,"MASSIVE upgrade compared to my Z fold 4 that lasted not even 3 months, better feel, better usability better features NO CREASE, better battery life, IR BLASTER! a feature I've missed having for ages. AMAZING charge speed if you're in a pinch, charger INCLUDED AND a case for itCamera bump is unnecessary and is only there as an attention grabber for the admittedly awesome camerasNo wireless charging, probably because of the camera bump( personal opinion)","June 8, 2024"
423,OnePlus Open 16GB,ton newyen,5,"After going with just iPhones since the iPhone 7, I'm glad I switched to Android this year with this amazing OnePlus Open.I frequently use the main screen because it's plenty big.  However, when I have time to watch a video or want more space, it's amazing to be able to open it up and have a screen that's basically double the size of a normal high-end smartphone screen.I know I could have bought a normal smartphone and brought one of my mini tablets with me to have access to a larger screen when needed.  However, I highly prefer using the OnePlus Open because it is so much more convenient to have it all in one device.The phone is super fast, and it has so much RAM that it runs seamlessly, even when I have multiple resource-intensive apps running at the same time.I'm very happy with my purchase.","January 27, 2024"
424,OnePlus Open 16GB,Ryan Turner,2,"This review is difficult to write because I wanted to love this phone, but it's hard to like it.Pros:- The form factor is spot on, with the outside screen being perfect for daily use- It's reasonably lightweight.- The build quality is solid.- Camera is above decent.Cons:- The inner screen is a disaster with a square-ish ratio, making it unpleasant to hold or watch videos.- Durability is questionable.- After-sales customer service is also questionable.- The deal breaker is the OxygenOS, which is riddled with bugs, making the phone unusable. It's not user-friendly and struggles with simple tasks, even breaking the weather app widget by not displaying information correctly.- Battery life is better than the Galaxy Fold but still can't last a full day.- Charging speed is only fast with the included charger; any other charger results in below-normal speeds.- Lack of wireless charging.While I love the phone's form factor, the numerous flaws and a subpar OS make it too much of a sacrifice to use this phone. Good try, OnePlus, but I wouldn't recommend this phone unless you're ready to deal with all these issues.","June 1, 2024"

Brightness of both the  Display & sound quality are excellent, Weight & dimensions are recommendable but more thin is appreciated.Inner display is spoiled though I never dropped the set for a single time and tried unfold as minimum as possible (not more than two/three times a day. I am really very mush disappointed as it spoiled in such a short period time & so minimum of unfolding.Now need to know from where & how can I claim warranty as I bought the set from Amazon USA & my location is Bangladesh.","April 2, 2024"
426,OnePlus Open 16GB,PSeven,5,"This is the best foldable phone I have used so far. Weather you are using is opened or closed it is simply the correct screen size and ratio. The phone is lightweight and feels very compact. The giant circle on the back may look scary but its not really bad once you use the phone. I tested the pixel fold and samsung z fold 5 at the same time and this beats them all at literally everything. The battery life on this was excellent, performance was super fast on every app. There are still bugs they need to work out with a random screen rotation issue but other then that it was excellent. The oneplus software was not getting in the way much with this phone. They embrace googles programs which makes the experience really nice. Products like the z fold 5 have way too many samsung specific requirements. I highly recommend buying this phone. It is well built, battery life and performance are top notch.","December 11, 2023"

I had a couple minor drops (a few feet with case on) but that's typical and phones normally last me a few years till breaking.Because I bought the phone on Amazon I wasn't able to have the screen replaced. OnePlus requires a phone ID and if that ID isn't from their online store they don't do repairs on the product (I wasn't trying to claim a warrant, but online they offered a 500$ screen repair out of warranty. I wanted to do the repair but couldn't because of where I bought the phone)","March 6, 2024"

Multitasking is amazing on this device and features to activate them should be the standard in the industry. The leather back is quite nice it is soft and adds texture to grip the phone with a case. Camera quality is better than the quality on Samsung folds in my opinion, but the bump is outrageously large. If you get pass the look, it is understandable to hold the phone and use it like any other digital camera. Also it gives a nice ledge rest on your fingers while you use the front screen... A  amazing phone.","January 15, 2024"

Honestly eating this 1 out of five I'll give this a 4.5 and only because it doesn't have wireless charging.

433,OnePlus Open 16GB,Dewone,5,"I've owned every Samsung fold starting with the original. I bought the Zfold 5 and was happy with it, until I bought the one plus open. The open is by far the most enjoyable folding device to use. Media consumption is on another level and the software is intuitive and very user friendly. The front screen is a huge upgrade from the Samsung devices and overall the displays are just more true to color. Camera is equally impressive and has some nice features too.  Battery lasts all day and then some. Wireless charging isn't even a consideration with the fast charging. Wireless has degraded by previous batteries. This is what Samsung should've done with the 5, instead of regurgitating the same form factor.","December 3, 2023"
434,OnePlus Open 16GB,Seth,5,"Honestly a phone like this is probably wasted on me. I think it would be impossible to recommend a folding phone even as good as this just because of how fragile they still are.... But if you're like me and have been wanting to pull the trigger on one for a while, this is probably about as good as it gets today. Screens are amazing, the multitasking features are really cool, and the camera is actually decent compared to other foldables. Sometimes an app will but out when switching between screens, but otherwise the software has been smooth.Really enjoying the splurge, we'll see if it holds up over time.","December 5, 2023"

Wider outside display, excellent cams and it even has stylus support not only on the inside screen but outside, too. You can use a cheap stylus from amazon, if you don’t mind not having all the features. Or you can basically wait for one plus to get their stylus on the market(amazon). So if you are thinking of a foldable i would buy it and try it out, you can return it if you are not satisfied. Thank you OnePlus and amazon.","October 29, 2023"

This foldable is by far the best phone that I have ever had with the exception that it is not dust protected. That is the only reason that I have it accepting Wi-Fi Hotspot from my daily driver S23 Ultra because I do need something that can withstand the elements. Update: Had to factory reset due to constant random resetting during WiFi calls and other tasks. Also found brick dead twice. After reset, no issues, yet. I'll give it a few more days. Update 2: Even after the factory reset, and a few hopeful days using everything else I like about the phone, it started to randomly reboot. This is a deal breaker. Edit Dec 25: I updated the software; crossing fingers that there's no more random reboots. Last edit: 1 star. When only WiFi is on the phone, no data carrier, loss of WiFi signal, causes phone to sporadically reset/restart, no matter what you're doing, even if on a WiFi meeting. Down to 1 star and ""Do Not Buy"" without good warranty status. You'll need the warranty. Reset 3 times back to back today, even after factory reset and all updates applied.","December 16, 2023"

476,OnePlus Open 16GB,Rahul D,4,"Have had this device since December 2023 (a few weeks after it came out). Below are some pros and cons.CONS:- Camera is mediocre, unless you are taking still photos (which are fantastic)- WiFi speeds are not in the same league of even a prior gen Samsung/Apple flagship devices. I have a S22 Ultra and this, and in the same location, the S22 ultra will show speeds upwards of 870Mbps, whereas in OnePlus Open will not cross 500. Yes, it may not be a deal breaker, but with most homes nowadays having a lot of IoT devices, bandwidth/ speed are all limiters. ALSO: Ensure to turn off ""Private DNS"" which will otherwise cause speeds to be EVEN MORE slower (!!)- Apps sometimes quit and need to be force stop and reopened. May or may not be an Android thing, but seems to happen more on this than my S22 Ultra- Compare the photos from this phone vs the S22 ultra (or S23 or s24) and those are noticeably better/ sharper. All these phones have AI and processing power, so no excuses for the camera being bad. But yes, the software is not up to the mark which could be the difference.PROS:- Screen and display. Size and clarity are fantastic- Still photos from the camera are excellent, with good clarity- Audio quality is really good on both phone / video calls and music, etc- The device is fast (exception of WiFi)MEHs:- Even in places with good towers nearby, the 5G speeds are almost useless (lets' not get started on the whole is 5G worth it discussion)- Phone does get noticeably warmer with using maps for a couple of hours or video playback for couple of hours- Battery life is okay, nothing to write home aboutOVERALL:While it is not a stellar phone for the pricepoint, it is definitely good. And hope it gets better with more OS updates. Will not buy another OnePlus until these improve though.","May 22, 2024"

478,OnePlus Open 16GB,Amazon Customer,4,"Phone is OnePlus first attempt at a folding phone, and it is a decent first attempt, but not at the full price of the unit. With incentives with trade-in (OnePlus 8 Pro) and repeat buyer, I got this phone for $350 less than retail. Still a bit steep for its design.I will get right to the point with my issues and hope that updates will address the issues:Apps do not realize that the phone is a folder. I play games, I run programs. Switching from full screen to front screen or vice versa the Apps do NOT RESIZE correctly. It just skews big to small or stretches from small to big. App must be restarted to correctly fit the screen.Game apps do not position correctly. I had a Fold it always sized the view area and positioned the app in a useable manner. This phone does NOT support full screen apps correctly...it is what I called center skewed.Screen brightness algorithm is very arbitrary. Screen gets bright if you turn it up manually. Outside in the bright sun it is visible when you MANUALLY turn up screen brightness. It does NOT automatically set screen brightness even when it is enabled, annoying. In a dark warehouse, on odd occasions the screen turns on with setting at 1/3 brightness...it is way too bright for my inside needs.Battery life is very good, fast charging via cable only is not an issue for me.  I do not need wireless charging.Screen has poor color saturation.  Colors are dark and muted, not bright at all like the older OnePlus 8 Pro.So far, I am tolerating the phone.

After a little more than 2 months, I was on Instagram scrolling,  them I saw two one inch lines on the screen, I thought it was part of the reel I was watching but swiped up and it was still there. I closed the phone and opened it back up and then the two small lines became one big line, then by the end if the day, it looked like the Pic. The front screen still worked and the phone still worked. The part that sucks is they want it back to verify it's not physical damage. So for two weeks, you don't have a phone. I just called today since it been a week and I haven't heard anything and the lady said they no longer have the black one and asked if I want the green one, I said send what ever I need a phone. Basically the deal breaker here is you need a back up phone if anything happens to your phone,  they want your old phone first. Any other phone company or carrier, you have the insurance and you get new phone in the mail and put your old phone in the mail. When I get the new phone, I will sell it for like $1k and get a phone here with my carrier, that way if something does happen, I won't be out of a phone for 2 weeks. Huge process deal-breaker, I could have kept using that phone until the new one came in. Now I am using my sons phone for 2 weeks until I get mine.","May 17, 2024"
480,OnePlus Open 16GB,Chris Yue,1,"Have had the phone only a few days, so too early to tell how it will hold up physically,BUT:  By ""design"", the Power Button does not shut off the phone, and instead goes to some kind of useless Google feature.  You need TWO HANDS shut off this phone:  Power button plus ""volume up"" at the same time.  Also by ""design"" the ""close all"" function does not close all, but leaves the app you last had open, open.  You then have to swipe the app to get rid of it.  (meaning: if you are watching PORN when your girlfriend walks in, neither the Power Button nor the ""close all"" function will save you - you are toast!  And to top it off, the display swiping automatically opens another useless Google ""feature"".  Seriously though, it simply makes the phone clumsy to use.  Interface is EVERYTHING with  a phone.  I got around the power button problem by installing an app which shuts off the phone, and installed a different Launcher to get rid of that second Google ""feature"".  Also, OnePlus customer service is non-existent, and getting a little ""dodgy"".  Then of course, OnePlus is a high tech manufacturer, so one should expect its customer service to be unreachable, dishonest and lousy.  I have owned five (six?)

481,OnePlus Open 16GB,Amazon Customer,1,"I purchased the OnePlus Open directly from their site. I made the dubious decision after reading great reviews online. I noted the detractors warning against quality control, software issues and support issues, but wrote these things off as an acceptable risk. I knew this was a first gen product and was willing to give it a try. I've done much the same for Microsoft, Samsung and Google, having owned both the Surface Duo, Galaxy Fold 3 and 4, and Pixel Fold.I ordered the device, and made the mistake of performing a trade in of my existing Pixel Fold. I was putting A LOT of trust in this working out. Typically when I try out a new device i just sell my old one on Swappa to recoup costs, but I was lazy this time... and I paid for it.The device felt GREAT in hand. The camera was good, and the multitasking was good enough to overlook the rest of the software. For the first week or so it performed perfectly with no issues, so i sent my old Pixel fold in since i only had 15 days before they would charge me the 1050 trade in value.The next day I noticed my phone was constantly hot and the battery was draining rapidly. So much so that plugging it in while it was on would only halt battery drain and not even charge it. For 2 days I was on track to get roughly 6 hours on a charge regardless of screen on time. I couldn't find a way to get to safe mode, or clear the system cache, so I simply did a factory reset. The problem persisted. I performed another factory rest, and this time didn't sign in. I simply accepted defaults and got to the homescreen. The problem persisted.At this point, I realize the problem is either so deep in the software or in the hardware that I can't trust this device and should return it within my 15 days for a full refund. I triggered a return through email and get a response that the process has been started. 2 days later, nothing. So I call in to start the process. Support tells me there are no pending returns but they can start one. They start the return and inform me that I will get a refund, but not the full trade in value of the phone. I'll lose 500 dollars because the phone is only actually worth 500 and the other 550 was a promotional coupon which is void since i'm returning the phone. What's more, I'll only receive the 500 dollars in a OnePlus store credit and not a refund. WTF?! Support also noted that I can't cancel the trade in, per policy, and they were unwilling to work with me any further.I take responsibility for the decisions that landed me in this position. Boy did my luck run out when I decided to purchase OnePlus, and trade my current phone rather than sell it myself.My experience sucked, but I'm giving this phone 1 star because you're rolling the dice on if you'll get a functioning phone as soon as you buy it, and that's unacceptable for a 1500 dollar device, even during the first gen. Check out the OnePlus subreddit. They have a PSA up warning all buyers against this phone. I wish I had listened.","March 27, 2024"
482,OnePlus Open 16GB,Amazon Customer,5,"It's easy to get hung up on aspects like how waterproof a phone is or whether it has wireless charging, but when you get into the day-to-day usages of a smartphone, that's when you'll identify aspects that really matter.For me, working as a standard phone that has great battery life, a great screen and a strong camera are most important. Having all of that in a form factor that also offers a built in tablet takes this phone from a great flagship device to do much more.The possible negatives: no wireless charging, not waterproof and size. This phone charges so fast with the included charger that wireless charging is not needed. I've been down to 50% battery, plug it in and in about 10-15 minutes it's nearly 100% again. Being able to charge up so fast has reduced the need/feeling of having to charge it up all the time or have wireless charging available. For me, I don't need to go swimming with this phone. I've recognized that for all the benefits I get in the day to day are worth being a bit more mindful of my device and how I treat it. OnePlus had dinner a lot to make the form factor off this foldable great, but it still isn't small. Having a back case and a tempered glass screen protector on the outer screen gives me piece of mind without making it bulky.Neutral: Oxygen OS. Many are used to Samsung or Apple for their operating system. I came from the Galaxy S23 Ultra and don't find myself missing anything. I feel like I've gained some customization and productivity.Positives: the camera, the screens, battery life and build quality. The main camera on this phone has impressed me. I was worried I'd have to compromise on this going to a foldable, but instead, I feel like I'm some cases, it even out performs my S23 Ultra. There's a setting for fast motion, which has been a big plus for catching amazing action shots. The outer screen on this phone is great enough to use it all the time, and makes it feel like opening up the phone to the larger screen is just such a pure bonus. I also didn't want to deal with a big crease in the screen, but Oneplus has designed this phone in a way where it's barely noticable. The battery life is great. I can use this phone for web browsing, social media, games and more throughout the day and find myself with plenty of battery life left at the end of the day. Lastly, the build quality on this device is impressive. OnePlus had always provided a premium build with their devices, and the Open is no exception. Everything feels solid, the speakers are amazing, the cameras work great, the fingerprint reader is flawless and the way it opens and closes feels strong and secure.Overall, this device may not be for everyone, but for anyone wanting a foldable, then I'm comfortable endorsing the OnePlus Open. I've had it for over a month, and a few minor gripes I had have already been addressed with a recent software update. Having had flagship devices over the years, this phone definitely is one and for me, is the first foldable that I don't feel like I have to compromise on flagship features and performance in order to have a foldable.","December 29, 2023"

485,OnePlus Open 16GB,Getch78,5,"I went from the Microsoft surface Duo 1 and then Duo 2. Then I changed to the Google Pixel Fold. The Pixel Fold was ok but felt like it was twice as heavy as the OnePlus Open. My hand would literally get tired if I was surfing the web on my Pixel Fold. Now I have the OnePlus Open and it is just better in every way. The phone is sooo much lighter, it's thinner, has a faster processor and more storage space. The crease from the fold is way less noticeable on the OnePlus Open than any other foldable. Also, I'm not a big camera geek but the zoom feature on the OnePlus Open is amazing. It's like having a pair of binoculars as a camera. I was tempted to get the Samsung fold 5 but front screen (when folded) is way too skinny for me. I like a phone (when folded) to be normal screen dimensions of a regular large screen phone. The front screen is so good that you find yourself surfing the web on the front screen and have to remind yourself that it opens up to a much larger screen. If you're in the market for a foldable, this is the only way to go...until something better comes out.","January 3, 2024"

487,OnePlus Open 16GB,user,1,"The OnePlus Open is a great phone and I love it! However the warranty is not that good. As you can see the left side of the foldable went green. I asked for a new phone under warranty. OnePlus denied and said they want to fix it. The entire process will take over 2 weeks or more. Customer service is not that good, in my opinion. This is a $1700 mobile phone with a less than desirable warranty.","April 26, 2024"
488,OnePlus Open 16GB,Amazon Customer,5,"This is my first foray into foldables. I considered the Galaxy Z Fold 5 and said ""NO"" due to the gigantic crease and the extremely narrow outside screen. I seriously considered the pixel Fold due to the well sized outside screen, but once again, said ""NO"" due to the gigantic crease on the inside screen. I almost gave up hope of a decent foldable until the Oneplus Open came out literally 2 days after I gave up on the Pixel Fold. Talk about fortuitous circumstances. The Open checks all of the right boxes for me. The outside screen is wide enough and is the same size as other phones that I have, but am not using. The crease is so minimal that it's almost unnoticeable. It comes in one storage configuration of 512 GB and one memory configuration 16 GB of RAM. It is a beast and the performance is killer. I've heard reports that after 2-4 weeks the crease gets a lot deeper/bigger. I've had mine for a full month going on 5 weeks now and the crease has not changed. Some reviewers on here mentioned how there are bugs and biometrics do not work on here. They must have gotten a bad unit or not know how to turn on biometrics for their apps. I have 4 credit card apps on here among other things that use biometrics and the biometrics works for all of my apps, that use them. Like any flagship device, there are little hiccups and quirks in the phone. There's a reason for that. All operating systems, mobile or otherwise are imperfect, which is why there are updates. If they weren't flawed to some degree, they wouldn't need updates. They would only need security updates. One thing I will mention is the magic erasure on the Pixel 8 Pro. It is a killer piece of software in the camera software that allows you to remove things from pictures you have taken. It comes in very handy. I thought that the Pixel 7 Pro, now 8 Pro were the only phones to have it. I was wrong. The Oneplus Open has it as well and it works just as well as the one on the Pixels. The Open also takes great pictures. The battery life is really nice. With My S22 Ultra and Pixel 7 Pro. I was usually at about 30% by the end of the day. With the Open I'm usually at 60% - 70% by the end of the day. O usually get up at around 6:00 AM and pull my Open off of the charger and then put it back on the charger at around midnight or 1:00 AM. I love it. Also, it charges up in about 60 minutes from empty. I know of no wireless charging that can charge that fast. It even has some software that charges slowly and finishes charging around your normal wake up time, based on your alarms. This puts less stress on the battery. Smart charging, or whatever it is called. The multitasking capabilities beats out the Pixel Fold and in some ways the Galaxy Z Fold 5. The Oneplus Open can have 3 apps open at one  time and you can scroll between them easily. It is really intuitive. The Pixel Fold is seriously lacking in that department. The Samsung Z Fold 5 isn't as good, but in other ways just as good in that department.  This is the best foldable you can get in the United States, right now. It also has an 8 Gen 2 processor and not a Tensor like the Pixel Fold. The only cons are the waterproofing, or lack thereof, I don't plan on swimming with it, and the software updates, which are minimal at best. It does come with a charger and cable, take that Samsung, and all the others that are rude enough to not send a charger with their phones. The price point is still a couple hundred dollars lower than the Z Fold 5 and the Pixel Fold, at the same storage amount. I paid $2,000 for mine, but that included $200 ear buds and a $500 Oneplus Tablet that is a midrange tablet, as well as a 100 Watt VOOC Charger, not the one the phone comes with. All totally worth it. If you do the math, it's not a bad deal at all. Last thing, if you are looking for a foldable with minimal crease, a wide enough outer screen, and is extremely well built with minimal software issues, you won't find better than the Oneplus Open.","December 18, 2023"

493,OnePlus Open 16GB,morgan,1,I will be posting pictures of both of my OnePlus open phones in addition to any other Amazon members who wish to share theirs as it is becoming increasingly apparent that a large majority of these phones have defective screens.  The defect is not easily detectable and there's really no effort being done by one plus open to either acknowledged the defects nor any conscious effort to repair them.  Currently building a group of other OnePlus Open customers to file a formal class action lawsuit as OnePlus has seriously failed to address the issue nor to honor its warranties.The current tactic with the OnePlus Open is to intentionally delay their response to reported issues with the phone in order to exhaust the 30-day warranty that comes with it.  A 30-day warranty one should note is very shady to begin with and is usually only offered with equipment that is not going to last past 30 days and that is exactly what happens with the OnePlus open except that for me in two separate occasions the phone developed a black line right where the creases which only increases over time My first attempt to return the phone failed due to the RMA number being invalid or having expired either of which prevented me from getting the phone to the proper facility.if you have a broken OnePlus open phone or a defective OnePlus open phone please contact me or leave a comment below and I will if you want add you to the class action lawsuit which they have been served before by the same law firm.  This law firm has successfully won a previous class action lawsuit against him and it looks like this incident is going to be that lawsuit look like peanuts being paid out because this is an intentionally bad faith sale of a defective product coupled with intentional to bad faith actions to honor their own warranty and insurance offering both of which are on both of these phones both of which are not being honored or even given the opportunity to be reviewed.,"January 30, 2024"

497,OnePlus 11 5G,Sean,5,"I've been an Android enthusiast since the first Android phone was available here, the HTC Dream/Google G1, I've run custom firmware, and tweaked the bejesus out of my devices, so I think I know a thing or two.This phone is absolutely top-notch. High spec hardware that works great, in a beautiful, slickly designed package. The Oneplus 11 will hang with any of the current gen Samsungs or Pixel Pro in just about any way. The camera performance may not test quite as highly as a current Galaxy S Ultra or Pixel Pro, but the cameras are very good and very close! Beautiful screen, blazing fast performance, 16gb RAM, and all the 5G and LTE bands you need for any US carrier, so what's not to like?I've found the battery life to be very good, as I still have at least 50% left when I get home from work. And as for charging, WOW, this thing charges ridiculously fast with the included charger - faster than just about anything else out there, and most phones don't even come with a charger anymore. Igo from 40-50% to full in almost no time. I did turn off the Wise charging feature though because I couldn't figure out how to set it up, and its mystery schedule didn't jibe with my super early wake up time.The lack of wireless charging seems unthinkable for an otherwise incredible flagship-level phone in 2023, and I have no idea why they omitted it. This is unforgivable, although I will say that with the battery life and super fast charging I can get by without wireless. This need not be a deal breaker even if you must have it, since wireless adaptors are all over Amazon for like $12.I have found some negative aspects of this phone, albeit minor ones I can live with. For one, the phone is beautifully designed but very slippery in the hand. You're going to protect your investment with a case anyway though, aren't you? I found a nice clear TPU one that shows it off will protecting it a bit and adding enough grip to make me comfortable. And I do wish the screen was flat rather than curved. I see no benefit to the curved edges, which can cause glare at some angles and lighting conditions, and they make screen protectors and cases a little difficult to engineer perfectly.The fingerprint sensor is my only other gripe. It works, but I have yet to find an under-screen sensor, whether ultrasonic or optical, that works as reliably and quickly as I'd like. Moto nails it with their side-mounted sensor on the power button of some recent phones, and I loved what LG did when the had it in the center of the BACK of their phones. My glass screen protector is probably partially to blame, but the sensor wasn't perfect with the factory-applied TPU cover, either. This has prompted me to finally try face unlock, which Oneplus has done a good job with, admittedly.All in all, I love this phone. It is probably the best Android device I've owned, surpassing even the LG V30 and Samsung s10 5G, which were my favorites in their respective heydays. The Oxygen OS interface isn't as intuitive as stock Android, and some people really don't like recent incarnations of it, but I don't have a problem with it. Full disclosure: the first thing I do with any Android device is install Nova launcher and the same basic setup I've been using for several years, so manufacturers' launchers are irrelevant to me, but Oxygen OS is fine with me otherwise and Oneplus bloatware is minimal.6/5 stars, GREAT phone with very competitive pricing for what you get.","July 24, 2023"
498,OnePlus 11 5G,Ivan,5,"Was very worried whether I could get a provider, because I was with Straight Talk with my last phone and I couldn't find information that Straight Talk worked on this OnePlus 11 phone. I went from an A51 Samsung Galaxy phone to the US Factory OnePlus 11.  I took the Sim card out of the Samsung and put it in the OnePlus 11 and I had service right away.I know I couldn't keep the new phone on the old Sim, so I went to get a new Sim Card, but ended up buying a Simple Mobile SIM card which is a sister company to Straight Talk. Had to call into Simple Mobile to set it up though.  It would not just setup. However, when I called customer service and they sent me codes, they asked me questions, such as ""what is your pin"", etc. and I couldn't answer them because I was not setup with Simple Mobile.  I kept saying I am not getting codes from Simple Mobile and I haven't setup security questions with Simple Mobile.  Later during the conversation I noticed I was getting messages from Straight Talk.  I then found out the same people I was speaking with work for both  Straight Talk and Simple Mobile. So, my codes were in another email address I set up for Straight Talk.  The security questions they asked me that I couldn't answer, were actually the Security Questions I setup in Straight Talk.  Was confusing.Want people to know, I just did not want to order a SIM from Amazon or Straight Talk and wait a few days to get it. That is the only reason I didn't set it up with Straight Talk. The IMIE number did work with Straight Talk. I tried it also with Google Fi and Verizon.  Verizon actually recognized the ESIM as well. So, I was surprised. So, my answer to, ""Will this phone work with Straight Talk?"" Yes it will and it also works with Simple Mobile.I bought the Simple Mobile Bring your Own Phone 4G LTE and 5G Sim Card. It was $1.00.  But they charged me another .55 cents for 911 emergency fee for the Sim Card.  When I signed up with Simple Mobile to be my actual provider, I noticed I am charged again .55 cents for 911 emergency fee?The look is different then what is in the pictures.  It is not a dark green.  In fact it is sort of a light blue green.  It is very nice looking and a wonderful surprise. I would say it is more of a marine blue. Laying down with a clear cover on the back of it. It is a light green/gray color.How fast it charges is amazing.  15 to 20 minutes and it is fully charged. Love it!It was very easy to setup.  I used the Google backup method, by backing up my old phone to Google Drive and then uploading from Google Drive to the new phone.  All my apps were setup automatically. I just had to put in my internet credentials and email credentials and I was all set.One thing I noticed was I couldn't shut the phone off. Apparently you press the power button on the right and have to hold the volumn up on the left at the same time to get the power option to shut it off. I didn't like that...so I went into Settings and went to Additional Settings and went to Power Button Menu and then to the Press and hold the power button menu and checked off the Power Menu instead of the Voice Assistant.Now all I have to do is press the right hand button and hold it and I get the Power off menu.  I did this because everytime I went to power down the phone by using the right power button, the Google Voice Assistant popped up.  Couldn't stand it, so I changed that button to just be Power on and off by doing the above.I know I read previous reviews stating this problem, but I don't think anyone said how to change it. So, this is for people like me, who don't want the google assistant coming up when they are trying to shut their phone off.I will try setting it up with my car next, but I really don't expect any problems. The service has been good so far and am not having any problems with text, voice or data.I didn't like the lock screen clock. It was weird as it separated vertically the hour and the minutes.  I was able to change that by going to Settings, then Wallpapers & Style, then menu option: always on Display and then changing the clock.  There are not a lot of options there.  But, maybe I can download something on Google Play.So, far very happy customer.Update:  Works with Android Auto. Set it up in my car with no problem.  Was tricky as I didn't understand what I was doing. Plugged it into my USB port in the car and plugged the other end of cord to the phone.  Went to menu in car and put on BT Pairing and went to my phone and swiped down to get Bluetooth.  It said available devices and gave me some sort of at numbers and letters that had no sense to it one way or another and I pressed that on the phone and then pressed BT pairing on the car menu and I then saw Car Audio and it asked me if I wanted to pair or accept that, so I pressed yes.  Called someone and it came over my car radio which was perfect.  Make sure car is on when you do all of this and it does say to have it in park.  I don't think it mattered in my case.  I have an older 2015 car and it worked fine.  I got calls in and they also went out.  Perfect!  The google mapping worked perfectly on my phone giving me direction by direction.Bought a second US Factory OnePlus 11 5GB for my husband and setup Android Auto and it gives us google mapping on his car dashboard with no problems.","November 15, 2023"
499,OnePlus 11 5G,Sean,5,"I was convinced to buy this phone after seeing the photos  my daughter got with hers.what i dont like is no SD card  for extra storage.256GB is OK  BUT migrating from a well used established phone with its files doesnt leave me a lot for the photos i will be generating with this.it appears the phone DOES come with a screen protector  on it. i didn't realize that and installed a second party screen protector, which caused a lot of issues which was quite frustrating, for instance  the phone was near impossible to catch a phone call as the screen was not awakened on a incoming call.  the touch sensitivity was not responsive and always misspelling and changing  my typing, I spent a lot of time correcting the spelling of my work.... again extremely frustrating.  after i observed the dirt that had collected under the protector, i decided to change it. and then is when i observed that there seemed to be a second one  i did not know existed. ......... soooo......after installing a new protector all these issues went away. it has caused me to retract all the bad things i had murmured about this fine cellphone/camera  with a poor interface.I still wish it had Micro SD capability a TB of extra memory, that would make me contented to a high level.when i initially set it up and transferred the old phone to new, i was surprised at the speed of which all the data i wanted was moved.  photos, videos, all other documents. However it lacked the bookmarks of my preferred browser.i like the way it manages the battery usage, notifies me when an app is using too much and sends me to the settings to tweek its permission and usage the phone / system Shuts down apps that have not been used in a few months and removing permissions. I am not sure if it is the new version of android but, it is keeping things  controlled instead of snowballing into a big mess that is hard to resolve later and running the devise into  high inefficiency.as for charging it is  screaming  fast. it has a setting that will take its time also  I believe it is good to avoid  baking the battery every time  you charge. and there are several times i have gone 2 days of use before running the battery low.as for the camera. i love the interface and the optical quality for a cell phone is astounding. even zoomed in the pictures maintain a fair level of quality. as opposed to my past phones that would zoom  but produced images that resembled impressionist paintings.  the portraits of people  and snapshots of random things always please. I cannot wait till the northern lights are visible here in the Alaskan skies.I will however retain my dslr equipment for  the money shots....I caught this on sale for $699 which is the most i have paid for a cell phone  ever.I love the freedom I have from the control of the famous fruit company phone, and the huge cost they sell their new model for... ouchfor me it was a big step up from the Blu phones, which I last bought the  F91 5G is no slouch  the camera couldnt do well in low light, but to its advantage it was fast,  and i have a 512GB Mico SD  on top of the 256 internal.  at $199 (Sale price )  but the camera sucked. so i GEEKED out and use both  cell phones for different uses.Thats all I can say for now.all the best to you and good luck","September 6, 2023"
500,OnePlus 11 5G,Peeky,4,"Overall, I bought this phone because it had the best specs for its price. Great camera, much RAM, just as big as my old phone (Hauwei SE Mate) if not just slightly longer, and also AMOLED! Oh and also the long security update promise of 5 years compared to some phones running only for 2 years.Some of the things I wish this phone had though are putting the fingerprint reader on the back, and having the volume button not be directly across from power (because down volume tends to have me press the power as well to open the shutdown context), and then there's the bug I experienced with the alarm function. When the alarm rings on my phone and I close the notification, there doesn't seem to be a way to shut it off except by force closing the clock app.Overall, I enjoy the phone I picked and don't regret it but I do hope OnePlus continues improving the software side of things.","March 9, 2024"
501,OnePlus 11 5G,Lakay,5,"More generic Android phone and doesn't have a ton of custom apps preinstalled.  I really wanted to purchase the Galaxy S23 Ultra, but out of my price range right now.  This phone has the same CPU and more RAM and higher resolution screen.  I've only had this phone two days and I'm still on the first charge at 72%!!  I've never had a phone charge last that long with normal use.  The screen on this One Plus 11 is gorgeous.  Clear and sharp.  There are tons of settings that help increase battery life too.Very impressed with 5G performance.  I live in small rural town in East TN using T-Mobile service.  All I had to do was insert my T-Mobile SIM card and turn it on. Using Ookla Speedtest app,  I am getting 533mbps download on 5G.  Even my Spectrum cable internet isn't that fast!  The OnePlus also has WIFI 7.  I only have WIFI 6 at the moment at home.  The phone connects to my wifi at full speed.Love the cameras too.  Not the 200MP of the S23 Ultra, but the One Plus 50MP main camera is still impressive and it has 48MP wide angle and 32MP telephoto.  It also automatically switches to macro.  Scanning barcodes is very quick.  My previous Pixel 6 usually had a focus issue when taking pics up close. I'm still experimenting with camera settings and features.  I really wanted something with a 'pro' setting.  I have a professional Sony camera and sometime miss having the control.  Most phone cameras do a OK job with point n shoot.  But sometimes are too blue or green for my taste.  I can edit in my PC, but much easier to do that adjustment before you take the image.  Granted phone cameras still can't compare to a professional camera, but this One Plus 11 with the Hasselblad 3rd gen camera for mobile comes close.Also surprised this phone comes with its own charger.  Battery Health Engine improves health and longevity, while still delivering ultra-fast charging speeds with 80W SUPERVOOC.  Thought that was just marketing hype, but the charging brick does seem to be heavier than most chargers.  If I had to complain, the included cable is fairly short.  I prefer 6.5 to 8ft.  Not sure if the 'red cable' is special, but will see if I can purchase a longer one.  So far very impressed with battery life as I pointed out earlier.Seems like phones are shrinking. Although it is suppose to be 6.7"" screen, this phone seems small to me.  I'm an older guy with small hands and still find this phone 'skinny'.  I know they can't please everyone though. I just like something I grab more securely.  It doesn't come with a case. Fortunately, there are many different cases on Amazon available.  Simple silicon cases to heavier duty military grade.  Hopefully the case I ordered will add some gripping width.So far I love this phone and highly recommend it if you can't afford the other flag ship phones.","December 3, 2023"

Después del 3T adquirí un 7T que de hecho todavía usa mi hija, por esta razón decidí adquirir este Oneplus 11 5G. Desde ese día mi descepción con la marca se ha incrementado hasta el punto de odiarla. En primer lugar compré el teléfono y a los pocos días de uso se me rompió la pantalla dentro de mi bolsillo. Como la garantía no cubre este tipo de daños tuve que pagar por su reparación unos 200 dólares. A los pocos días de recibirlo reparado una actualización de software OFICIAL dañó el OST y tuve que volver a enviarlo a reparación. Cuando envié el teléfono estaba en perfectas condiciones pero resulta que allá llegó la parte de atrás rota y me tocó pagar algo más de 100 dólares por la reparación. El teléfono nunca debió ir a reparación en primer lugar por causa de ellos.  Ya llevo más de 300 dólares en reparaciones (casi la mitad de lo que costó el teléfono). Nunca pensé en recibir un servicio tan mediocre y un celular igual de mediocre. En mi vida volveré a comprar Oneplus, por favor aléjense de esa marca ya que no tiene la calidad de antes.[English]I have to say that I have been a Oneplus user since Q3 and I have always been satisfied with the brand. After 3T I acquired a 7T that in fact my daughter still uses, for this reason I decided to purchase this Oneplus 11 5G. Since that day my disappointment with the brand has increased to the point of hating it. I first bought the phone and after a few days of using it, the screen broke in my pocket. Since the warranty does not cover this type of damage, I had to pay about 200 dollars for its repair. A few days after receiving it repaired, an OFFICIAL software update damaged the OST and I had to send it back for repair. When I sent the phone it was in perfect condition but it turns out that the back part arrived broken and I had to pay just over 100 dollars for the repair. The phone should never have gone for repair in the first place because of them.  I've already spent more than $300 on repairs (almost half of what the phone cost). I never thought I would receive such mediocre service and an equally mediocre cell phone. In my life I will buy Oneplus again, please stay away from that brand since it does not have the quality it used to.","July 22, 2024"
503,OnePlus 11 5G,GGRussell,5,"The Hasselblad camera system is amazing.It takes better photos than any other cell phone, and better than many standalone cameras, too.It charges fully in like 15-20 minutes. It's always done when I check its progess. That fast charging system is mindblowing. Not only that, but the battery stays charged way longer than any cell phone I've owned. The battery and cameras are ideal; no need at all to improve those. The rest of the phone is just as good.It's as perfect a cell phone money can buy, in my opinion.","August 8, 2024"
504,OnePlus 11 5G,Ivan,5,"First off, a little background: I come from a previous line of Samsung phones. I have an iPhone for work, and am forced to use it.That said, I was looking to upgrade from my S20FE due to the device pushing 4 years old. I toyed around with the S23ultra and although the camera is pretty sweet, I couldn't justify all that extra money for a feature that isn't a core function of the telephone. What was left in the price range I wanted to stay in, was the Pixel 7 Pro, and this OnePlus 11 5G.  I opted to purchase the OnePlus with the 16gb of ram version, and I cannot complain at all about it. (I use Straight Talk's service btw, and it has better reception than the S20FE had.There are a couple small idiosyncrasies in this phone's UI that just ""feel"" odd, but I think it feels that way because I have become accustomed to Samsung's UI as being standard.Other than the very minor quirks that are normal for Oxygen OS, I have found NOTHING disappointing about this phone. The camera is absolutely fantastic, except the selfie camera takes ""colder"" looking pictures.Easy fix: install the gCam port.Now I use gCam for selfies, and the stock app for everything else.The charging rate of this phone is downright staggering in comparison to any iphone or Samsung or Google product, hands down.Also, it ACTUALLY CONES WITH A CHARGER. None of the flagships from the previous three manufacturers include even a crappy charger, let alone one that pushes EIGHTY WATTS🤯So do yourself a favor and compare this phone to the pricetag of any phone with a Snapdragon 8 gen2 processor, and also factor in the fact that it has 16 GB of ram, and it's no wonder the phone is so crazy fast and smooth. Go look up a 256gb S23ultra, then look for the 16gb ram option. There isn't one. Same chipset albeit an over locked version, but ""only"" 12gb of ram available. Couple that with the $1,100 pricetag, slow charging speed, no charger in the box, and now you'll see why the OnePlus 11 is such a huge value for your money. Did I mention OnePlus is now offering FOUR YEARS of Android updates? This this will be good through Android 17!!Honestly, it was a tough call between this and the Pixel 7 Pro because of the telephoto lens on the 7pro. But, the Tensor chipset is not exactly the most powerful thing on the block and struggles if put up against a serious gaming session. Also saw lots of reports where the rear camera glass was brittle and breaking during normal use, and Google wasn't covering it under warranty.This phone is the clear value champion of 2023.","April 24, 2023"
505,OnePlus 11 5G,alonsohall,3,"Current review as of Feb 2024:Pros:Display is litterly the best I've ever used4 years of os updates5 years of sec updatesA powerful albeit toasty Snapdragon  8 gen 2 chip.In built Gaming toolsAmazing cameraAmazing community supportA Fairly feature rich uiCons:Curved screen meaning no proper protectionHeating issues with the supposedly ""ultra efficient"" Snapdragon 8 gen 2.OnePlus starting to ignore it's communityTablets are better made than the phones.Glass back with no grippable material so a case is mandatory to prevent falls.A ui that takes a giant chunk of ram due to the new trinity engine that does the opposite of what it claims and have made temps even worse on the device.Final thoughts:Worth the price if you get a 12-16 gig model and only if you can deal with the cons of don't plan to use it for gaming.I plan to sell my OnePlus 11 along with my old Samsung Galaxy tab s6 and m31 and buy a modern mid ranger instead as I can't deal with the curved screen and heating issues any longer.Other: if you want a good tablet brand then OnePlus is it for you the OnePlus Pad It never heats up no matter what you throw at it and is build to last. Unlike their phones as of late sadly.While omeplus does care for its customers. They are.... Very incompetent. And are not doing a good job at listening to the community.As for tech support and repair wise? They do it amazingly.If you wanna get a OnePlus phone go for the Nord 3 it has the same CPU in the OnePlus Pad and that thing never heats up. So the Nord 3 is bound to have much better temperature control.Old review I regret making:Summary:16 gigs ram an apu that seldom heats up (snapdragon 8 gen 2)a great UI and os (oxygen os in my case as this listing is an international/us model) is 800$ and not overpriced.Not one to bother about camera quality as It doesn't matter these days as everything can take decent to amazing screenshots as long as it's 150$ and above.Pros:A phone that seldom heats up and can run anything at max without breaking a sweatA phone company that seems to care about their customers (thank God.)4 years of guaranteed os updates and 5-year sec updates at minimum.16 gig ram 256 storage with a very optimized and energy efficient APU (and current the most powerful phone apu as of May 8th 2023 (snapdragon 8 gen 2) for 800$(samsung asks for 1000$ for the same apu but slightly overlocked thus making more heat with 8 gig ram 128 storage. apple has a apu around the same power but only has 6 gigs of ram and asks 1400$. google asks for 700$ for 12 gig ram 256 storage and their apu that is about half as powerful as motorola their moto edge+ 2023 has 8 gigs of ram same price as this and has stock android.)Great os (oxygen os in this case as it is an international/us model)Game tools to increase quality/performance  (samsung has it as well but oneplus's version has more options.)A LTPO3 Fluid AMOLED display that can easily look more vibrant than a ips LCD if set on pro mode. (I use max cool color temp personally) No opinion:camera systems on everything over 150$ have good cameras these days.Cons:Glass back. Makes the phone hard to grip onto and caseless and it makes it slide everywhere till May 16-25th it's the 6th rn as of this edit. Seriously just put a thin plastic optionally tearable covering in the back. The tpu screen protector that comes on the phone should honestly be put on the back instead for grip.The curved screen is bad as it's almost impossible to get a screen protector on. and it also is easier to break from a fall. Can't have battery saver on when updating When in landscape and inside a game the notifications don't appear as normal and are a small one-line only. And I want the game tools they have so I have to deal with this, unfortunately.Personal cons:On-screen fingerprint sensor, used to the more accurate side-mounted ones. Plus sometimes screen protectors have annoying holes in them for the sensor.6.7 inches instead of 6.8 why you might ask? Well. The past 2 phones I had, a s22 I returned. (Samsung screwed me and didn't want me as a customer.) And a moto edge 5g UW 2021 were both 6.8 and they could have made the battery in the OnePlus 11 5100 milliamp instead of the 5000 if they did make the phone 6.8 inches. But that's just me. Final notes: If your gonna get a flagship Android phone that you want to last at least 2 or more years then get this if you want an OEM Android.As the pros far outweigh the cons. If you want stock Android go for a pixel or the 800$ moto edge+ 2023 or unlock the boot loader on this thing but I don't recommend that.","May 5, 2023"
506,OnePlus 11 5G,daddyzrule,4,So I have gotten 3 phones in just one year.. and this phone is the one I got at last.. and battery is still going strong. Find myself in low battery I plug it in and after 20-25 mins it's done.. I have gotten with 40 percent of battery and still happy. Am.a heavy user and just 1 charge and good. With that 40 percent by the time I get home which is 6 hrs later I still have juice..what I dislike is the camera.. it's not bad by any means... But other phones even cheap can automatically focus.. while this phone that was worth 800. Can't🫤🫤speakers are nice and loud... Brightness isn't bright when it comes to very harsh sunlight 90+ in the heat in Florida. Not even medium brightness helps very dim. And full brightness it's ok but not as bright as let's say the iPhone 15. Reason I know a family has it not sure able the model. But it's brighter and actually can see the screen better from the brightness. But another thing I really love is the connection with devices... One car I owe refuses to lower the volume by phone. While this one at times it works and can lower and bump up the music.. finger print is a 6-10. Hyped up ... Maybe I haven't used it correctly. But use a screen protector and doesn't seem to scan. Had a privacy screen very thin. And it isn't your normal screen protector your thinking of. It's like wobbly flimsy. And wasn't able to scan. And it's hard to find screen protector with this phone.. and seriously don't waste your money.. if you want this phone go for the 12 plus. I was 1 month or weeks before the new one came out😭😭😭😂 but do I think its horrible no.. it does what it needs to do for heavy users . Never have I came across any bugs.. or virus. Am very impressed on how I use it and I have proof.. still 100 percent . And one million dollar tip... USE ORIGINAL CHARGING CABLE. No matter what it is. iPhone android.. you welcome. And yes I love the color of this phone. People have asked what it is and like how it looks. Multiple tasking is also great like that alot. And the cable and brick it came with is legit. It is the biggest reason I even wanted the phone. And I plan to have this phone for at least 4-5 yrs before I even touch another phone.,"March 23, 2024"

508,OnePlus 11 5G,Ivan,5,"I was looking for a phone that had good processing power and ram. On the upside, I can create 4K videos with this and it's fast. Which is what I wanted and the pricing is just right!Cons, it doesn't have as much storage space as other phones.Regardless, I would totally recommend it if you're looking for something quick. The camera quality is pretty good, too.This phone is what made me fall in love with OnePlus.","July 22, 2024"
509,OnePlus 11 5G,peter,5,"I'm beyond happy with my purchase. This is my first flagship phone and I chose the OnePlus 11. One feature that might not effect everyone like it does me is when your completely emersed in an app such as gaming or shopping and you get a call, answering the call doesn't teleport you to the call screen. You stay right where you are and never miss a beat. That's just a little thing I love but it's also full of big things like response time! Connection speed! Charging speed!!! The feel of this phone is just pristine. Everything is quick there's floating windows and the oh so perfect everytime finger print scanner which is under the display. No buttons! It hasn't failed to read my finger once. I saw a review saying the opposite but I've had zero trouble. My son even said it's probably not evening reading your finger just letting you in...so he tried his finger and couldn't get it to open lol. I love the camera it really takes true to life pictures. It also does this thing with the screen when your trying to take a pic of something with writing on it. Like it clears up the writing so you can take a clear legible picture of the writing or document. It also has screen recording that also will record your camera view at the same time if you so desire. It's really great with personalized settings too. The theme and icon personalizations are amazing. There's probably a lot more I'm not keen to yet but that's what I can think of. Happy shopping!******Update*********5 months laterI still can't get enough of this phone. This is how a phone should be! Responding quick, no worrying about space, pull out the camera instantly with 2 clicks from power button, amazing pictures and video(I have only bad experience with photos in past phones so my comparison/opinion might differ from yours) and the 27 min to full charge is just SO FREAKING CONVENIENT! The sound is loud enough you don't struggle to know ""is that MY phone going off?"" It connects to EVERYTHING EFFORTLESSLY! Tap to pay is a breeze no more (is it right here or... this way...) holding my phone like a puzzle piece trying to get the right angle to pay for things anymore! Pay at the pump, get cash at ATM buying groceries just whip out my phone, bam bam bam, DONE! I CAN'T EXPRESS ENOUGH, I LOVE THIS PHONE!PS my finger print scanner is great! I saw other reviews staying other wise but I never have problems. My screen protector is not tempered glass just in case that has anything to do with it. It's just like the one that came in the screen to begin with. YEAH, IT CAME WITH ONE! LOVE IT!","August 28, 2023"
510,OnePlus 11 5G,Jinntao13,4,"I have a one plus 6t, it has a great feature - a drawer for holding widgets. They removed that, totally gone. Now when you slide to the left you get google news, with no solid way of removing it and if you do disable it, there is no left pane. There is a widget shelf of sorts but it only holds 6 things and only useless apps. So now you have to use more screen space for widgets. And the widget sizes are limited so they have to be very big or very small.The phone is plenty fast, but they dumbed it down. Before I could long press an icon, see its widget and install. Now you can't. Before you could long press the widget and reset  it or restart it, now you can't. Before you could use an index to find stuff in long lists, now you can't.The camera, dumb. It has 2 modes - 12mp, 50mp. Nothing in between. So its either a 4mb file or a 20mb file, with no say 20mp in the middle. There are 3 lenses - no zoom. A wide angle, a normal and a 2x, its not a zoom, its just another lens. And when you get too close to something it switches to macro. Which is fine, but macro is a different lens, and so the viewpoint changes with it. Its like when you hold your finger in front of your face and open and close each eye and it jumps around.Its also hard to hold horizontally because they stupidly put the lens right where your finger goes.Beyond that its a good phone, it could really use a camera software update and I really want my widget shelf back. Oh and do get a case, this thing is super hard to hold. The edges are active and you constantly press stuff. Its hard to hold and your hand migrates to the old part of the phone with grip and that's the camera lens. The black phone feels like plastic and doesn't give you grip.It does come with a nicely applied plastic cover but it scratches and gouges easily.","October 22, 2023"
511,OnePlus 11 5G,GinaBB82,5,"I don't know why people or other reviewers are so technically specific about this phone as compared to other phones of its type, but I decided to go ahead and get one. I am an owner of the Samsung S23 Ultra, which is a decidedly wonderful phone, but what I really love about this phone is the little things that Samsung does not do! To be honest I have had OnePlus phones in the past and I was thoroughly satisfied with them. I bought the Samsung S23 Ultra because I got a great deal on the storage upgrade, like the same price for the 512 GB as for the 256 GB, in which trade in from my old S22 I ended up paying only a few hundred dollars.With this phone (OnePlus 11) s's et up was incredibly easy and quick and I have over 120 apps on my phone! It just went so quickly that I had to keep checking to be sure it was actually working. The call quality is unbelievably good. Even when connecting it to my Wi-Fi, it went so quickly that it was scary!Now as for the camera quality. Like most people, I do not buy a smartphone just to take pictures and videos and I am certainly not Frederico Fellini. The picture quality is excellent even in close-ups and in darker situations. I think a lot of people even professional reviewers when it comes to cell phones have gotten just so picky and nitpicky that they miss the major points of whether or not it is just a device, because there's always a ""but""!People are sticking to the point that this phone only has an IP64 rating versus an IP67 or 68 rating. This phone does well in splash situations or rain, versus being able to submerge the phone like most people decide to stick a $1000 cell phone underwater to take pictures of fish anyway! It's a bogus point! Besides there are cases you can buy, waterproof cases, that can handle this if you do decide to go deep sea diving with your phone or are worried about it getting wet and falling out of your pocket in a pool or in the ocean. It's just a nonstarter for an issue.People also complained that it doesn't do wireless charging. With the charger, it comes with this thing and the ability to go from 0 to 100 in literally a matter of minutes who gives a damn about a wireless charger when you can easily put this charger/adapter in your pocket and use it anywhere there is electricity! Again another bogus point!For the price, simply put, this is an outstanding phone and it is clear I should have gotten this one instead of the S23 Ultra because from my viewpoint they are both equally as good.I'm loving it!","May 30, 2023"
512,OnePlus 11 5G,PhotoKing,5,"Bought a ''used like a new'' and it came exactly as described, didn't have the original box but it was neat with unnoticeable use marks. Been a One Plus user for quite some time and changed to Samsung two years ago when I lost my 6T, I am glad I am back with 11. As usual, the fast charging never disappoints while a single full charge lasts more than 24 hours if you are a regular user who does not dwell on games and online live streaming.","July 1, 2024"
513,OnePlus 11 5G,Radashack,5,"Very nice mobile all round.  what's outstanding is the camera the collaboration with Hasselblad really paid off in spades.  The charging profile is some next level stuff.  I started charging it when the battery was @ 25% and some 5 minutes later it's reporting that it's at 45%.  Good stuff there.  Considering that it's a performance product I am still working on configuration to get more battery life out of it between charges.My biggest issue is finding a front screen protector product.  This phone has the curved display and I'm still going through various brands of protective film that will stick to the curved parts.  I know that it has the tempered glass but with the dolby vision I really don't want to have the front screen scratched.  The app management system is pretty intelligent and will shutdown apps that are running in the background to save on battery life.OnePlus Oxygen OS is really good as well.  OnePlus also provides support through 4 system updates (it shipped with android 13) and all security related patches.I went with an unlocked international version because having the flexibility to go to a different cell service provider that gives me options.  It also comes with 2 sim card slots so if I travel outside the USA, all I have to do is purchase a sim card / service and I'm back in business.Considering that all mobile devices I've owned in the past have only been changed out at year 4 or 5 on a annual basis that makes this even more attractive for the performance that it delivers.  I am not going to go over all the specs here, Oneplus has that already.Definitely recommend.","December 16, 2023"

515,OnePlus 11 5G,JustaDude,5,"This is the most beautiful phone I've ever seen or held.I have both the OP11 and  S23 Ultra at home for personal comparison.The way I stream,  Netflix, Tiktok, Youtube (2-3+ hrs daily), with almost the highest settings in every category (refresh, resolution, brightness, etc) the OP11 battery  noticeably outlasts the S23. When charging, the S23 took about 1.1/2 hour and was still not 80% using a MacBook charger. The OP11 charge time is around 25 min to 100%!!When taking a random pic of my living room  using both phones, - I thought something might be wrong with the S23 in comparison (not kidding). I'm not a camera/ telephoto freak, so the crazy camera abilities touted on S23 are lost on me.The OP11 UI is attractive and exciting making the S23s seem utilitarian. No heat issues, quality seems impeccable, performance all outstanding on both phone. I have queried OP support on one issue, the ability to turn on/ off Airplane/ Bluetooth modes with the screen locked. They responded within two days as promised. Even if someone were to steal and turn on Airplane mode the phone is useless to them, also ""Find My Device"" will record the phones location the moment Airplane mode is switched off..My only REAL misgivings are the auto brightness (way too dim), and the outdoor brightness (not quite enough - for me).The  S23 w/ 512g storage/ 12g memory $1400, the OnePlus11 w/ 256g/ 16g memory  $649!!Having said all of this, - because of the brightness issue alone (the most important criteria to me, along with battery and charging time), I am going wait until FEB/ MARCH of 2024 when the OP12 is released, as it addresses the brightness issue (from 1350 nitts to over 2000 nitts, the S23 is 1750 nitts and S24 purportedly around 2500 nitts).Certainly the price will go up - for both phones.Obviously these are my findings and opinions.UPDATE: I kept it! - I just couldn't send it back. The S23U is my phone, but at home this is all I use. After lot's of research, MY ONLY MISGIVING with this phone are the ""attempted"" repair horror stories. Parts seem to be impossible to obtain, and on OP site I cannot locate an auth repair center in California.","September 26, 2023"
516,OnePlus 11 5G,Michael S,5,"For years I bought used phones and used Virgin for not a lot of money. My needs changed so I picked up a Samsung habit and ATT was happy to feed me unlimited.I'm 65 and retired now so my needs have changed. My Note 10 plus works well but is dated and Samsung no longer provides support. I like to solve problems before they occur so I started researching a new phone a year ago. So many choices most of them good, but expensive out of pocket. Carriers are happy to help you get one so you can take on 30 months of high profit plans.This phone has a lot of good reviews and rightly so. Samsung S23 Ultra is awesome and really way more than I need at $1200.00.This is $800.00 and after a day can't find a flaw in fact it too is awesome.Blazing fast. Battery last. Long time. Recharges very fast. I never used wireless charging before so don't care this doesn't have it.The speakers are more than adequate that too I don't care about so much because I stream via Bluetooth.The camera I haven't used yet but I see it has dual camera mode for those that want to vlog in 8k. That is a big thing with reviewers and maybe me. I got rid of my DSLR because it's huge and went to Canon G7Xll which at 20 megapixels takes great photos. The Samung took great photos. This will take great photos.Audiophiles exist that study the nuance of every note. I'm not that guy. Saturation etc in photos isn't going to bother me much and I guess if it did editing will come in handy. They say the best camera is the one you have with you and this is it.Spend $800.00 for this phone/mini computer and it will get you through 5 years at least unless like a magpie you're attracted to shiny new things. Like me put a sim card in and you're ready to go. I live in Mexico now and use Telcel at $10.00 a month. Or spend $80.00 a month for the next three years for virtually the same thing here. This also has an esim which I haven't worked out yet. Doesn't look like Mint mobile recognizes this model yet.","July 12, 2023"
517,OnePlus 11 5G,Sean,3,"I really wanted to give this phone five stars, but it's caused a few nightmares that can't be ignored. Performance wise this phone is a workstation. However, it's shortcomings are found with its lack of reliability. One night I didn't charge my phone and the battery went below 10%, so it turned on some power saving features (possibly shutting down communications). Upon fully charging my phone and attempting to use it I realized I didn't have any signal so none of my text messages or calls were coming in, I had to switch devices while sorting this out (it took days). I tried every method I could find online to fix it, but no luck. My last resort was to disconnect the battery, AKA remove the glass back which shatters easily. Disconnecting the battery and reconnecting it work. Fast forward a few months later everything seems fine and this time I find myself watching YouTube and a WhatsApp notification comes in. I reply to the notification through the notification window while simultaneously watching YouTube, something I do all the time, and after replying to that message the phone freezes. I tried holding the power button, but it will not shut off, I try holding the volume up button plus the power button for over 10 seconds, and it doesn't shut off, so I try holding the volume down button plus the power button and it will not shut off. Ultimately I had to remove the glass back again and disconnect the battery. I have purchased a replacement glass back because it is shattered by this point, however, I lost confidence in this phone's reliability and I feel that I'm going to have to remove the battery again at some point, so I am refraining from installing the glass back. As for the specifications the phone is fast the Snapdragon is top notch and 16 gigs of RAM make it feel like you can do anything, these specs would be great for a tablet but the lack of reliability is stopping me from giving it five stars.","February 2, 2024"

519,OnePlus 11 5G,george,5,"I switch between iPhones and Android phones from time to time.  I love the easy customization of Android system and seamless synchronization with PC Windows and my Google suite (I am a heavy PC and Google app user).  And my smart home is Google based which works better with Android. But I hate the fact that Android phone/system gets sluggish after a while.  I hate everything about iPhone but I do think iPhone/iOS has better optimization and provides a smoother experience.OnePlus 11 5G is a great Android phone and I have yet to find any main shortcomings. It is slick, fast, powerful and has a lot of features.  It accepts both fingerprint and facial recognition, which is very convenient.  The screen looks amazing. The color is vivid. The camera is top-notch. Since it's Android, it supports all kinds of audio codecs. I am able to listen to music at either LDAC or aptX quality on my bluetooth headphones while iPhone will restrict me to AAC.  I am also a business person who travels often in different parts of the world and needs to switch sim card.  The dual sim card slots make my life a lot easier.  There are several useful features built in the operating system such as split screen, floating screen etc., making working on my phone a lot easier.The fast charging is great. A full charge can last a whole day without any issue. This is amazing considering that I am a heavy phone user. However, I wish it was equipped with wireless charging.  This may be the only shortcoming I found so far.Overall I am very happy with this phone so far.  Great job, OnePlus!  I just hope that OnePlus won't be banned by the US government again one day like what they did to Huawei since OnePlus is also a Chinese company.","September 17, 2023"
520,OnePlus 11 5G,Jacky,4,"The phone is really good over all. Performs well. I like hoe it looks and performs. But I do have an issue. I hate putting cases on phones. I like a sleek, thin phone that slips right in a pocket. But the back panel of this phone is made with a very slick polymer that makes it impossible to hold in on hand.  You are either fighting to keep a grip or accidentally activating something. On the curve edged screen. So the answer is a pop up gripper on the back, right?  Wrong. Those will not adhere to the back of the phone. Nothing sticks to it including Gorilla Tape. I wish I could have this phone with a glass or smooth, glossy back on it. I had to buy a case for this one.","January 8, 2024"
521,OnePlus 11 5G,Y Ma,5,I love OnePlus. Have used since the OnePlus 6 and changing devices is so easy. Easy phone clone so set up is seamless and that is a big reason to stick with them. No wireless charging might hurt some but it doesn't bother me. I don't take a lot of pictures but I am happy with basic photos. If you need small details like off color details on white paint it is hard to pick up. Too pictures of a room for rent and it was hard to make out defects you can see with your eyes. Maybe it's a setting but I don't know how to adjust it. Everything else is perfect and it is fast. Games run good and I can have hundreds of tabs open with no issues. I am sure the 12 is amazing but if this is on discount and you need an upgrade pick it up.,"April 5, 2024"
522,OnePlus 11 5G,Jeffrey Wessel,3,"I like the phone does what it's supposed to. It's fast , great camera and sound quality but the back is made of glass and it shattered even while having a case on it ,kinda disappointed.","August 12, 2024"

524,OnePlus 11 5G,Kenneth H Addison,5,"What an amazing smartphone. Hands down better than the ultras and pros on the market. Biggest selling point: full charge in 20-25 min. SD 8 gen 2 processor is blazing fast. The camera housing looks great and takes great photos. It probably won't beat pixel or s23 lineup but it takes great pics for its price and everything else it offers. The battery at 5000 mah lasts all day and if you forget to charge it overnight, it can charge while you get ready. 5-10 min and you're getting enough for the day  Samsung, Google, and Apple can't say that. I had a P7 and even though I liked the software and haptics, the slow charging was a deal breaker for me. OxygenOS is pretty great. Has loads of customization and OnePlus doesn't use as much bloatware as Samsung so it's probably the best android skin out there. It has great customization options and has nifty features like a screen off button (not double tap but in the drop-down menu), 3 finger screenshot, scrolling screenshot if you want the whole page, quick launch storage and calculator, etc.The phone is definitely my favorite OnePlus phone so far. That alert slider is handy too although I usually have it on vibrate so I don't use it often! Oh, and face and fingerprint unlock are so fast and accurate, even with a screen protector on. Dual speakers so it gets loud. The volume rocker and power button are on different sides so it's easy to differentiate the buttons unlike Samsung or Google. I included a few photos so you can see what it looks like. The case is Suknap and is the best case I've tried. Lastly, 80w charger in the box. Talk about the value king of 2023. OnePlus, keep it up!I love the OnePlus 11, definitely my daily driver.","April 30, 2023"
525,OnePlus 11 5G,Kindle Customer,5,"I tried so many phones to upgrade from my oneplus 8 pro that my brother started making fun of me.I tried Sony Xperia 4, iPhone 13, galaxy s22, and oneplus 7 pro. And I didn't like ANY of them.They had better cameras for sure. Especially the iPhone was my favorite, but I hated using most of them. The s22 and pixel 7 pro were awful to hold, it felt like I held a brick all day. I use nova launcher and pie control for more efficient navigation and the pixel had issues that made it difficult to use. Oh also, the fingerprint reader was so bad and unreliable. Sony Xperia was a cool experience, but overall I didn't like it, iPhone I kept and use but just as a ""pro camera"" and s22 I returned in a heartbeat.Now, the oneplus I can't stop holding and using. Even before I transferred everything over and had the Sim card in, I used it just to open it and see the beautiful screen and the fluidity of the OS. The camera is OK. I'm a professional photographer so can be picky with pics. The iPhone 14 has a phenomenal camera, oneplus 11 has a camera that can take some great shots, just not all the time. There's been some I've been surprised and impressed and others that were just mediocre. I almost got the 10 pro last year and I'm so glad I waited, none of them Felt right until this one. I love this phone. Beautiful screen, super fast, decent camera, OH RIGHT the charging is also insanely fast! Another great thing. I want to add, there has been some pictures that look REALLY good. Some looked like I took from my dslr, like super good, but it's not all the time, the lighting has to be right(I do wish it had some features thats exclusive to the pixel tho)","February 20, 2023"
526,OnePlus 11 5G,jesus romero,5,"I am am long time smartphone user & one of those people that replaces their phone every year. I had the original OnePlus One, 2, 6, 6T, 7 Pro McLaren Edition & then I went to other brands eventually ending up with a Pixel 6 Pro, 7 Pro & I was getting the new phone itch again & started looking around. That's when I noticed somehow the glass in one spot over a lens on the back had broken & I never break phones. I had been reading about how much better the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 was over the Google Tensor G2, not only that, but my Pixel 7 Pro had 12GB RAM & 128GB storage. I went with the OnePlus 11 5G 16GB RAM & 256GB storage. It was actually a little cheaper than the Pixel 7 Pro was & honestly I'm shocked at how much of a superior phone it is as well! The screen is absolutely gorgeous QHD+ HDR10+ Dolby Vision! It even supports Ray Tracing in games which is crazy! The audio is unreal! Not only does is have Dolby Atmos, it also has Spatial Audio which is 360 degree sound & if your headphones support it will even auto adjust the sound scape to the orientation of your head! It is extremely fast, surprisingly faster than the Pixel 7 Pro! I have always liked Google phones for the latest updates as they're released, the pure Android experience & since the switch to their own SoC the Tensor G1 & then the G2 the AI features are incredible. Even with all that, I think I'm sticking with OnePlus from now on, because I am beyond impressed!","July 27, 2023"
527,OnePlus 11 5G,Sean,2,"First impression is how beautiful the phone is. This was great because I'm not usually the kind of person who's big into the aesthetics. The only knock to that is the cameras take up such a big part of the phone and are pretty exposed. Kinda looks funky to me, but that's kinda how most phones are going. Because they are so exposed, they will definitely need extra protection there, which is difficult right now because the phone is so new and case choices are extremely limited or for preorder. This is also true at the moment for screen protectors. The weight of the phone is very pleasing as well, not too heavy but feels higher quality.The phone is obviously a beast hardware-wise and the cameras are great for a general user, but are absolutely not top of the line (but close). You can also set upto an additional 12gb of unused space for additional virtual RAM if you want even more speed.Another important thing is the phone is super slippery and hard to hold safely, especially with one hand. So again a good case will be definitely required unless you like smacking yourself in the face at night with it while lying down.Also keep in mind, no wireless charging, which isn't important for me, but if it is for you then keep that in mind. The battery otherwise it's nuts and barely moving. It charged from 20% to full before I even finished moving over my stuff from my old phone (one plus 7 lol), which btw was seamless and took about 20 minutes for ~30gb of data via the old cable.The main reason for losing two stars is that the One Plus launcher keeps freezing and locking up even after fully updating the phone and multiple restarts. Maybe I don't know the technology well, but I have to use the default system launcher and even then it's extremely buggy. The One Plus launcher still trys to turn itself on, so even though I have the other launcher set to default it breaks and freezes the whole phone every few minutes.All in all the phone is obviously still new, so we'll see how it develops. But for what you pay you get a killer phone able to compete with the big guys on *most* fronts and still save a couple hundred bucks.Assuming the UI bugs get fixed soon, I'd def give it 4.5-5 stars initially pending more usage.Edit 3/17: ended up returning it and removing a star. Not sure id recommend it anymore. Constantly buggy and getting worse. My battery immediately started draining crazy fast and would barely last one day. My calls started bugging out too and I had to reset my phone way too often just to make and take calls. Again, I want to give it more stars, I probably shouldn't even give it 2 stars but here we are. If you are in a slightly more remote area then I'd definitely stay away from this one. My old OnePlus 7 pro has better reception than this thing...","February 21, 2023"
528,OnePlus 11 5G,Ivan,5,"I've been a OnePlus fan for a while but they haven't dive anything special since making the 8T 5G and selling it through T-Mobile.  The 9 was eh, and 10 was a little better then that.  The 11, this 11 is so much more.  First it feels great in the hand wether you get the glossy green back or the textured moon dust black.  The screen is easy to see in daylight, super fast refresh!, and responsive to touch.  The curved edges sometimes pick up a touch but rarely. Look and feel is so on point. Since it isn't being sold through a major carrier Amazon offered a 0% option of 5 monthly payments automatically deducted through my payment of choice.  I love this option for a phone. 1. Paying cash not credit rates.  2. Paid off in less then a year so if something happens or you want to upgrade there is no contract terms to figure out. 3. Worth every penny without raising the costs.Overall this was a great comeback for OnePlus.  A high end performer, stunner, that is easy to purchase without getting tangled in your cell plan.  Syncing from my iPhone 13 was pretty easy too.","October 22, 2023"
529,OnePlus 11 5G,Michael H,4,"I see many mentions of this is just as good as the s23U. That's just not true, I have both.First, if someone was to hand me this phone(op11) and say I could only use this phone I would be pretty happy. It's a good phone.  Screen is pretty vibrant and bright enough. The camera takes good photos in most situations. Performance is fast and charging is incredibly fast. You wouldn't regret owning this phoneNow I have both this and the s23u and I can tell you the s23U is either a little bit better or much better than the OnePlus 11 in everything except charging.The s23U's screen is much more sharper, better dynamic range and brighter. The colors are more accurate.The camera processing is better. It handles poor lightning conditions better. The images are more detailed and sharper. The self camera is better in every way than i on the OnePlus 11. The zoom capabilities that the OnePlus just can't come close to.I wish found the Bluetooth audio better on the s23ultra and it was noticeable.That being said the OnePlus 11 is a great phone.","July 15, 2023"

I didn't know this issue that a lot of people is facing it until it happens to me. I spent a lot of time going to the OnePlus sebsite, Google, to no availability for help. Whatever the information provided from the OnePlus does not work at all.Luckily, it connects to WiFi 2.4GHZ and 5 GHZ, which are acceptable, but not so happy with 6E. I'm just curious why OnePlus doesn't want to fix this important issue for all the new phones??","October 15, 2023"
531,OnePlus 11 5G,Egg man,2,"This is hard to write.  The hardware is top notch!  great screen, super fast, super responsive. Long battery life, quick charging, fits in my wrench pocket on my carpenter pants.  I like that they provided a screen protector even though it wants to peel off.  It is fun for me to smash it back down and work the bubbles out.Now for the bad news.The software sucks.  Sucks, sucks, sucks!  I hate it, it frustrates the hell out of me.I should document all of my gipes but I don't want to waste my time.  Trust me, the software sucks.  Here is the one that gets me the most.Some numbnuts put the fingerprint reader right in the middle of the lower half of the screen.  Fine maybe - I don't know.  But they weren't smart enough to write the software such that you can't activate the button under the fingerprint reader once the screen unlocks.  So... you unlock the screen and unless you remove your finger within the 1 zillionth of a millisecond after unlock but before wake up you also press the button under your finger.  So you open up whatever app (I moved all of my apps away from that area) or you pause your music, or start it or whatever because coincidentally the start/stop button for amazon music is RIGHT THERE!  OMG it makes me so mad to unlock the screen and immediately also pause my music.  yeah yeah I know...  Use face unlock.  I do - but frequently that is less convenient.  I know it seems like a 1st world problem, but I'm telling you it is the tip of the software bug iceberg.  If I wasn't into this POS for $600 I'd throw it way.  Seems like I'm stuck with this until Verizon offers a trade in on anything other than OnePlus.Okay, one more since I brought up face unlock...  The button layout is terrible.  To face unlock you need to press the power button.  Well, the volume button is exactly opposite.  so you squeeze power and almost always also squeeze volume up and do you know what you get?  A screen shot of your lock screen.  Super useful.  You could do fingerprint, but that makes me much madder.","January 13, 2024"
532,OnePlus 11 5G,Beemer,5,"Wow!I've wrote many reviews on Amazon and this is the only product that deserves to start with that.I've always been picky with technology and felt the saying you get what you pay for nearly always applies, OnePlus has broken that mold. I was a diehard Samsung Galaxy fan until this phone showed up at my house in a simple red box with little on it other than the number 11.I always watch reviews, guides and tips and tricks videos before I make a major technology purchase and this phone was no different but even after a few hours of hearing trusted technology advisors telling me this was a true flagship phone, I was still taken aback by the incredible value this phone is at this unheard of price point.Copying my S22 Ultra contents over to the 11 was pretty easy with the OnePlus Clone Phone app and it was fast.I've yet to through an app or game at this phone that it hasn't crushed and the 5G connectivity is a step above anything that I'm used to.The sidebar that I came to love on my Galaxy phones is not only here, it's easier to use and customize than it was on those phones.I can't find anything bad to say about the OnePlus 11 Pro, it's just one of those very rare times when ""Wow!"" accurately conveys the correct sentiment.","June 16, 2023"
533,OnePlus 11 5G,Patrick,5,"I've always had a Note, because Android was about getting the best phone for your money. And this phone is just that, 90% of an S23U for half-price. Or more like, what the price should actually be if we didn't live in psycho clown world.Pros:Fair price. Similar to the price of my old phone.Usable amount of RAM. My 2019 phone has 12.Great battery. 5000mAh should be standard.Pinhole notch. Unlike the 14Pro cringe 5head.Fast charging. Like actually fast. 30min to full.Cons:No SDXC. I get it, it's slow and NVMeSD isn't out. But it used to be an Android selling point. What am I supposed to do with my 1TB SDXC? Eat it?No mmWave 5G. Verizon is pushing this hard and it's absurdly fast. Also absurdly bad at penetrating buildings so I don't ever get it on the 14Pro unless I'm bathing in radiation under a tower. But come on, you put the 8gen2 but not mmWave? I'm still getting 350Mbps down on UWB but I don't know how future-proof it is.ColorOS is kinda cringe. Have to relearn the gestures since they aren't 1:1 to Sammy. I just don't get the need to reinvent the wheel with OS skins. Use basic Android, provide the same features as ANY competitor for less money. Profit. Why do you need to skin anything?Overall a great device, and Sammy should be ashamed.

Signals are full, more than my Pixel 7 pro on T-Mobile, OnePlus 11 gets a full 5g bar signal, all the apps I put on are performing and flowing! To the reviewer that complain about the USB 2.0 instead of 3.0, is nothing wrong with it, plus in the box is a huge 80wats charger that can juice up a laptops or Chromebook super fast, it's not big deal if the cable is not USB C to USB C, it's a normal USB (2.0) to USB C ( 3.0) you'll be dumb if you have to turn this phone for this simple fact!

Once part of the screen looked like I had cracked it and went black but when I restarted it went away. The fingerprint sensor is reliable when used with the protector that comes installed from the factory, but isn't as good with aftermarket ones. It isn't always easy to find settings for individual apps, it feels like some are missing. Still, for the price and quality of the hardware, I recommend it.","September 2, 2023"

538,OnePlus 11 5G,Ivan,5,"Overall I'm loving the OnePlus 11 so far! It really feels like a flagship device, but without the ludicrous flagship price tag. It's not a perfect phone, but delivers on the aspects that matter most to me: Performance, screen quality, and battery life + charging speed. The phone doesn't skip a beat with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, and up to a whopping 16GB RAM. Gorgeous screen with 1440p resolution and buttery 120Hz that dynamically scales down to save battery. Speaking of which, the battery experience is wonderful. I'm seeing 1.5-2 days of regular use before needing to charge back up, which takes less than 30 mins!The phone does have some shortcomings however: No wireless charging, IP64 instead of IP68, USB 2.0, decent cameras that are overshadowed by the competition, and finally a very different UI experience compared to OxygenOS of the past. These are all sacrifices that I'm willing to make given the price point of the phone.Conclusion: It's a well rounded flagship level phone that makes smart compromises in order to justify a more reasonable price. For the money it's hard to find a better value in terms of sheer hardware specs than the OnePlus 11. Although not quite the ""flagship killer"" we used to know, this showing is certainly a step in the right direction.","February 22, 2023"
539,OnePlus 11 5G,Chris,3,"The modified custom Android OS can be problematic at time. It's glitchy, fussy, and appears to be unstable in my opinion. Things on it get copied and pasted out of nowhere without your intervention. The screen is sometimes unresponsive or gets very jumpy. The finger sensor on the front is so dumb and leaves excessive prints on your screen. If you buy a screen protector, the fingerprint sensor will struggle to read your fingerprint. This phone is slower than expected because of the burned in bloatware. I am not seeing the speed as a Snapdragon Gen 2 should be, and that is because of the bloatware. One of my older phones seem about the same speed as this one. This phone isn't fast. The selection of mobile carriers will disappoint you. I could not get Verizon and the many Verizon sub-carriers to work with it. But AT&T and T-Mobile and their sub-carriers are a go. This phone is overpriced in my opinion. Buy a different phone, please if you are going to spend that kind of money.","November 7, 2023"

Those three bands have serious speed in them. The main three carriers in the US and their mvnos utilize those bands for signal in their networks. Because of this, this phone will not give you the best possible signal.

Had the Samsung S21 ultra which is a good phone like all Samsung top tear phones but OP is a flagship killer for it's prices, specs, and performance. Some people complain about wireless charging not be available but wit a battery that last like this there no need. 6.7 inch vs 6.8 inch is no contest. Smaller form factor makes it easier to used on hold. Adding back the slider for mute, vibrate, and sound is awesome.

Too many accessories and benefits lost by not having this on the phone.When I say the battery tech is impressive, it charged it from 46% to 100% in 20-something minutes.Otherwise it seems up to par with flagship devices, so I won’t give it 1-star.

So i decide i'd never buy an iphone ever again. So i was looking at other expensive options and narrowed my choice down to Samsung or this company. I chose this company due to the cheaper price than Samsung Ultra 23.  camera seems fine.  which is one of the reasons i upgraded to an expensive phone.  i also wanted more internal storage, that's another reason i purchased.  what i dont like about the cell phone and all cell phones is that when i put it in my jacket or coat pocket, the phone hurts my insides.  stomach, side, etc.  The cancer and reproductive harm risk is real.  Also when i have it in my hand a long time, i get pain as well.  due to that radiation risk, etc.  I was forced to buy a cell phone because its the way people use social media and connect, and post content, etc.  But I would prefer not to have a cell phone at all due to the cancer and reproductive harm risk, which is very clear with the pain i get when carrying it in my pocket and holding it in my hand.","March 6, 2023"

You have to go digging around a sensitive electronic component to clean it out or hope an air compressor can blow it out enough to hold the charging cable in again.

Problem is it freezes up with OEM email app, OEM texting app, and an installed forum app. Locking up has progressively gotten worse over the last few weeks.

It's not a perfect phone, but it specs deliver in the areas that matter: Excellent battery (I get 1.5 days of use before I need to charge it again) plus the charging speed is amazing, great screen quality and the performace of the processor is great. This phone with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, 16GB RAM simply rocks. Great screen resolution and smooth 120Hz that can dynamically scale down. The cameras are ok, a lot better than the ones my other phones had. Oxygen OS is ok as well, somewhat different from other experiences I've had but it's nice.The phone has some cons that to me are that important: No wireless charging (not really necessary with supervooc charging), IP64 instead of IP68, USB 2.0. But given the price point of this phone, this cons can be overlooked.Conclusion: It's a must get. For the money it's hard to find a better option, it cuts some corners but it's worth it","March 3, 2023"
552,OnePlus 11 5G,Mr Dad,5,"This phone is a game changer for the price. Super fast, takes amazing photos, and it's half the cost of a Galaxy Ultra.There's YouTube videos. This one is ""only"" #4 in Android Photo taking. Considering there's hundreds of Androids I'd say that's pretty good.Same hardware as a Galaxy Ultra. Bigger OLED than the base Galaxy. Great user interface.Oneplus is back.Oh I have to mention the physical slider like iPhone has. Except it has three settings... Silent, vibrate, loud.I had a Motorola Stylus 5g 2020 before. Same 5000mah battery but after work, even when new, I'd have between 30-50 percent remaining. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 is so efficient. I'm coming home with 70-80 percent. Plus the charging is INSANE. I have forgotten to charge it at night and plug it in in the morning. 15 percent. I'll shower, shave, and come back to a 100 percent charged phone in 20 minutes.This phone is incredible for the price.","July 14, 2023"
553,OnePlus 11 5G,Joaquin,3,I was initially amazed with the performance of this phone. I needed to take a video to show how the monitors were glitching on a train and send them back only problem was the camera on my phone kept freezing during the video for up to 5 seconds. Then after repeated attempts it would freeze and shut off. I downloaded several other camera apps and they all had similar issues so I'm guessing it's the camera itself. I need to take close up pictures for work and this camera struggles to get good close up pictures. Battery life and charging rates are this phones strong points it's nice to plug it in and have a full charge in less than 30 minutes. Overnight charging at the slow rate was problematic I set my alarm for 4 am and got up with 70 percent charge but didn't notice until I was at work with no chargers available and almost ran out of charge since I could never figure out why I turned off that feature. Overall it has been a good phone just wish the camera would work better I'm hoping the last update took care of it I haven't noticed it lagging lately.,"June 24, 2023"
554,OnePlus 11 5G,The Curious Noob,5,"The biggest thing I disliked ,in the beginning  it would not pair up with Android auto. I had to call customer service and get into developer's mode and we got it going. Since then there were only a few small issues once in awhile for some reason signal shuts off by itself and I have to turn it back on. my last two phones were Samsung Galaxy s22 plus and then the Google pixel 7 pro. I would rate this phone faster and smoother than both of them. Once I get used to this software on here I think I'm going to really love it. The battery lasts forever and when you do need to charge it it charged super fast takes a full charge from 0 in 25 minutes.","September 19, 2023"

557,OnePlus 11 5G,Sean,5,Basically a good phone but camera sucks. The camera software automatically resets to use HDR after about an hour. This will give everything outdoors an eerie blueish tint and make your photos generally look like cheap grainy Warhol imitations. OnePlus knows but has no plans for a fix.  The only fix is to manually go into settings every time you use the camera and inhibit HDR.  I will get a pixel phone next time.,"February 14, 2024"
558,OnePlus 11 5G,Ivan,5,"Super at all levels. Buy quality, not brand. You will never regret buying this phone. I joined from +7pro (the one with the mechanized camera) to 9Pro, and now I have 1+Open and +11 5G. Everything about One Plus is sleek. The phone is super fast and runs multiple apps without lag.

559,OnePlus 11 5G,Amazon Customer,3,"Scrolling:Some apps like YouTube, Google pay, Prime Video etc.. are locked at max 60Hz refresh rate. In other apps where it actually supports 120hz refresh rate, the throttling is very agressive. This leads to a bad scrolling experience especially when compared to similar priced phones from Samsung. Having different scroll speed on different apps is very annoying and it only gets worse with time.Audio:Dolby Atmos only works with Bluetooth. No support on phone speaker and the deal breaker for me - no support on Android auto. So of you care about music quality while driving, look elsewhere.Haptics:Haptics mechanism itself is good overall. For some reason no way to enable haptics for home gesture. It works for back and recent gesture. This is very annoying.Charging:Very fast. Full charge under 30 mins. But you need to carry a OnePlus charger everywhere you go. Phone battery is good, so you can live with it.So the overall theme is that they are trying to make a fast phone, but the experience is NOT smooth. Come on OnePlus, you used to be better than Samsung! People are willing to look beyond the camera experience and still opt OnePlus for the fast and smooth experience, but unfortunately that's not the case anymore!","March 3, 2023"
560,OnePlus 11 5G,Oteng Selasie,5,"Love my OnePlus 11 so much!!  You will not be disappointed.  The haptics are amazing, the performance is fast and fluid, especially for gaming.  The camera takes stunning photos, especially portraits which I take a lot of with family and pets (see example taken of my cat).  Night photography really captures details and the video recording is beautiful.  It doesn't get the credit it deserves in terms of camera as it revivalswhat  the best phones have to offer.  Yeah, no wireless charging but so what?  The battery life gets you way more than through the day (I'd like to see the Pixel 7 Pro say that) and to charge the phone all the way in 25 minutes is game changing.  A lot of people also through shade at OxygenOS being ColorOS but honestly, I love it.  So many nice features and customization that the hate it receives is completely unjust.For the price point and all that you get with this device, it simply can't be beat!!","February 23, 2023"
561,OnePlus 11 5G,VJ,4,"I've used budget phones for years. So I finally splurged on a high end flagship model. The camera is incredible on most basic modes and on portraits. But not that impressive in low light. And my phone has locked up on me at times. With 16GB of RAM I'm surprised. It's something that would happen with my old cheap phones, not expected with this model. I will say most of these issues emerged after the upgrade to Android 13 so maybe it's more OS than a phone problem.","July 18, 2023"

If done again I'd likely choose black over the green.I guess charging is fast.Cons:OxygenOS is clunky, feels less stock android than I'd like. Oh yes, and launcher crashes out of box not sure what that is about.Scrolling smoothness is somehow less smooth than my 4 y/o phone, not sure if it's a refresh issue but annoying no matter.Outdoor screen brightness is quite poor compared to what I had expected. Nowhere near iPhone 13 Pro, and at times seems worse again than my 4 y/o phone.Will it meet my needs? Likely. Does it meet my expectations at this level for OnePlus? Not really.","March 9, 2023"

But in the end I gave in n chose this phone! The camera quality isn't amazing but it's not bad either. The charge holds for at least 24hrs.i had to charge my s10 every 4-6hrs n it became a hassle!! This phone is almost perfect. No portable charging which doesn't phase me since it holds a charge for a good while and charges super fast when dead!!

568,OnePlus 11 5G,Ivan,1,"For a while now, I've maintained that OnePlus and the Google Pixel range are the only good Android phones on the market. You might guess that I'm a fan of having a ""pure"" Android experience on my devices, and you'd be right. If you are like me and think that using a Samsung phone with all the ""value-added"" bloat is a torturous experience, then I'm sorry to say that I believe OnePlus is clearly going down that route.The moment I started setting up the phone, I could tell something wasn't right. There was too much flashy nonsense, but I got to the end of the setup and started looking around. Almost nothing is vanilla; you've got OnePlus's special homescreen, their icons, their apps, their theme. They've got ""wonderful"" value-added features that you can, admittedly, turn some of them off in the settings. But once you explore some more, you find a bunch of totally useless bloat.At the same time, while there's some bloat, it's still surprising how they manage to ruin Android such that right from the beginning, you notice pointless battery drain that shouldn't be happening. Not to mention, if you dig a little deeper, you'll find out about the stuff under the hood, OnePlus's special throttling, and you can read about their well-known benchmark manipulation and so on.Take a peek at forums, and you'll see people complaining about constant instability and old bugs never addressed, updates rolling out so slowly that some people only get an update after the subsequent version has already come out. Even for security updates, which frankly should be a big deal, they are still rolled out slower than they should be. The entire point of security updates for Android is that they're important, they're time-sensitive, and they're easy to implement, right?So, if you want this phone because you think you're going to get something like a vanilla or ""pure"" Android experience, please don't bother. In fact, just get a Samsung instead if you're willing to deal with annoying bloat. At least in that case, the hardware is better. OnePlus isn't even cheap anymore, anyway.","November 18, 2023"

It charges very fast and preforms even better.The price is a steal for this device. Everything you need a phone to be and more.Highly recommend this phone and also other Oneplus phones.

570,OnePlus 11 5G,John Harpur,5,"The phone is pretty awesome. The UI is pretty similar to my previous phone, Pixel 3. So the transfer wasn't too bad. I really love the gaming features, in allowing you to control how to optimize your gaming sessions. Plus an FPS counter, CPU and GPU as well as a Temperature. One feature that I will miss or havent found yet, is to automatically change my phone to ring/vibrate when I'm using a certain device or on a certain Wifi. It's a feature in Pixel 3 and have not found in OnePlus.Also looking for a case that feels like the back of this phone. The back feels so nice that I want that as a case. Too bad the sides of the phone is smooth and can be slippery as per usually, this kinda force me to find a case, which mine didn't come until a few days after I got this phone..","February 21, 2023"
571,OnePlus 11 5G,Mike,5,Opinion time. This phone fits in my small hands perfectly as opposed to wider Samsung and iPhones. Beautiful amoled display. Very close to stock android apps open quickly and has no trouble with phone calls and reception thanks to the Qualcomm chip. Doesn't heat up. Plus it has a couple apple like features. Like the side silence vibrate button and when calls come in you can lower volume by looking at the phone screen. And finally it has fantastic battery life along with the ultra fast charging. 20 to 100 % in 20 to 30 minutes. 5 stars from me,"October 12, 2023"
572,OnePlus 11 5G,Ricafort Caballes,5,"I've been utilizing the OnePlus 11 with 16GB of RAM, and I have never encountered a phone that can switch between different applications so fast without having to reload them. Additionally, the battery life is the best I've ever encountered, and as a bonus, the phone can be fully charged in 20 minutes or less. Because of the battery life and the extremely fast charging speed, I do not believe I will ever switch to any other phone brand. The facial recognition works perfectly, even in low lighting conditions, based on my experience. You get an excellent value for your money with this phone, and I recommend it to anyone who is considering it but undecided. If you decide to purchase this phone, I highly suggest the poetic revolution case on Amazon, which, in my opinion, is just as good as OtterBox. With that, you'll be all set","March 28, 2023"

574,OnePlus 11 5G,JakeSwagger,3,"I am a huge fan of OnePlus phones, but I'm very disappointed with the OnePlus 11 5G. I've had a OnePlus 3T, 5T, and 7T, and they were all great phones that worked perfectly. The OnePlus 11 5G gave me problems from the beginning. It failed to recognize any usb connection to share files, and did not work with Android auto (since it wouldn't recognize any usb connection other than charging the phone). After doing some research, I found out how to get into the developer setting and enable the usb recognition, so my Android auto connection began to work, but the every time I turned the car off and on again, I would have to restart the phone and update the usb setting again before the phone would recognize the usb connection. It was too much hassle for something that should just work automatically.  I saw in some forums that this is also the case with their version 10 phone, so it must be an issue with their most recent OS. I'm going to wait for them to address the bugs before I buy another OnePlus anytime soon.","April 2, 2023"
575,OnePlus 11 5G,Berna,4,"Great phone, No downsides to the operation of the phone. I purchased this item used.

577,OnePlus 11 5G,Sean,1,"So let me start by stating that I have been a One Plus loyal customer back since 2014 when I had the pleasure of getting an invite from one of my friends s to purchase the OnePlus1. I have had  OnePlus3T, OnePlus6, Oneplus7(for a short period of time this on I broke it), OnePlus8T, and now the onePlus115G (this without considering earbuds and other accessories).It has been a great phone for 7 months. Last night I went to bed as usual, read a few articles and went to sleep, the next morning my phone was off, which thought about right as it probably got discharged (had about 10% charge), so I plugged it in for 30 minutes, when I came back the phone was overheated and still off and unable to turn on.I called support the first agent dropped the call. The second agent Erna (10:29 AM 11/24/2023) transferred me to a supervisor Stefan, who said to be from escalation Support.The bottom line, is to get support I need the IMEI, but the phone does not have an IMEI on the back; I seriously no longer have the original box, so what I was told is that they can't do anything for me because I need the IMEI to start a service request. Amazon invoice and order do not show the IMEI.So I really have an expensive brick in my hands because the manufacturer has no process or means to support me. I have been a customer for 9 years, and never required support from them, a nd now that I really need some help, their response is that I need to understand they can't do anything without the IMEI.So this is the last OnePlus phone I get and I would seriously advise you to get another brand other than OnePlus because they will not blink before throwing you into the water, no real customer service.","November 24, 2023"

I could go on and on. No, it doesn't have wireless charging but I don't care about that. Camera is great but that isn't important to me either. I focus on speed, size, battery life and lifespan.

New phone but a million updates which make is slower and less responsive. Like every phone. It's fast right out the box. After the million updates it gets slower and less responsive. Even if you turn on high performance and I'm not using this phone to play games. I'm using it to get work done. So simple stuff really. Apparently it seems impossible to remove the google home screen news widget on the far left side. All things google don't want to work well. Makes me want to get my 4 year old phone back out just to do basic stuff that works right. Going onto Google maps looking for tow trucks. First location wants to bug out and throw all my settings backwards like metric. Then when I try to view reviews, websites, etc looking for tow trucks it wants to crash. Show me nothing. This is running off home wifi. When I go to phone data it won't work at all. When something is time sensitive like looking up a tow truck for my vehicle sitting on the side of the road I don't need problems. Btw I'm not blaming this phone. One plus is legit. I'm blaming Google and Android snapdragon processor. It just updated to the newest version this morning. 13.1 I believe. They are never going to stop making all this new super fast hardware slow with all this new software malware. So it doesn't matter if you get this phone or a S23 cause it's the same instituted malware filled snapdragon processor and Android operating system and they will continue to max out its hardware with resource consuming software that way its never really an upgrade it's just a constant battle to stay with the times and draining your income.","July 29, 2023"

The camera is pretty great as well I've been impressed with the quality of low light shots especially.And yet, despite being ostensibly everything I want in a phone, in less than 3 months I have come to despise this device. I will be replacing it as soon as possible. The OS is nothing short of rage inducing. Constant harassment about battery optimization is the most egregious issue. Even on apps I've explicitly marked do not optimize. Even on so called performance mode where I've been forced to acknowledge that battery life might suffer before turning it on.It makes me want to throw it against the wall. Notifications never come on time. My email updates once a day most of the time. I'll get texts hours late. This is the only phone I've had in the past 5 years that frequently and repetitively closes Spotify while I'm listening.It literally just popped up another notification trying to coerce me into ""optimizing"" an app I've specifically marked never optimize. Because ""optimize"" actually means ""remove 90% of the functionality you installed the app for in the first place"".Do not buy this phone unless you want to be treated as if you have a toddler's understanding of tech.

Perfect 5G signals everywhere I go. I previously owned a pixel 6 pro and couldn't even get 5G in the area I work nor could I get consistent 5G signals in my home. All of that has changed these last few days. Needless to say, this phone is a no brainer. Get it!! There's nothing more to say.","September 5, 2023"
594,OnePlus 11 5G,Owen,5,"Received it yesterday, only 1 day experience right now. The design looks kinda strange at first glance but feel much better now. So many details make me feel surprised and comfortable. I used to be an apple fan for years and tried  S22+ last year for the first time. Can't imagine the alert slider is even better than iphone. Camera is perfect for me, I love the tunning of color and night mode, plan to test portrait mode later. The OS is much better than Samsung, so far so good and haven't seen the interface issue posted by some review videos. I guess my next phone will be OnePlus as well, just don't want to pay $1000 for phones anymore.","February 23, 2023"

596,OnePlus 11 5G,JackieJ,1,"I thought this was going to be a great phone but I have been very disappointed and am selling it.All kinds of fancy stuff but it does not make the basics work:. The floating keyboard which looks fancy COVERS UP the input areas in Keep, OruxMaps, etc. It literally renders these apps unusable. You have to guess what you are typing. See the picture. Maybe there is some workaround but I could never find it.. Strange synchronization problems with KEEP which I use all day. The new line key does not work in KEEP.. No way I could find to turn on voice commands when an alarm goes off, so it is constantly listening and transcribing. Interference between Android Voice Access (AVA) and Google Voice Typing (GVT). Maddening if you use this basic functionality.. AVA bar at left top covers the clock... crazy. I spent hours trying to figure out a workaround. I need a glanceable clock.. Apparently does not work with Google Voice when it has a SIM. I never even put a SIM in it because other things above were non-functional.. OxygenOS is different but not for any good reasons I could describe.","May 20, 2024"

Boasting a large, high-resolution screen, the phone delivers a visually stunning experience. The battery life is impressive, ensuring a day's worth of usage. The smooth performance and excellent picture quality make it a standout choice. Transitioning from a previous OnePlus device was effortless.

600,OnePlus 10T Moonstone,Beca H,4,"Pros:1) powerful / fast2) a good camera3) the selfie cam is better than the S223) swipe music controls for any music app4) customizable swipe controls to open your favorite apps when the screen is off5) ability to sign into WiFi from the tray instead of going to settings every time6) ability to connect to Bluetooth from the tray7) Zen modeCons:1) the camera is lacking for a flagship. The macro lense never takes quite crisp enough pictures. The main cameras zoom is grainy and pixelated. The main cameras video doesn't have good stabilization software2) trying to change media output is a pain compared to other phones, leaving you swiping the tray down twice, clicking a menu, clicking media output, and finally able to change it3) you can't change the shortcuts on the lock screen for some reason4) it is hard to disable the Google feed screen which I personally find useless. You have to disable the entire Google app. This was an issue on the N100 as well.5) after the last system update their ""red cable club"" app, is no longer in the app menu and cannot be uninstalled or disabled, and thus it is requesting updates when I will NEVER use it.6) after the same update, the Shelf (a secondary tray essentially) which was useful at first due to the pedometer and ability to add extra widgets like Wundergrounds weather, suddenly you can't use any custom widgets and the remaining options all suck, so it's an entire tray with one useful app... Aka, as good as useless.7) No MicroSD slot for the sole purpose of trying to force you to pay more for the next level sub-model. This is becoming a common practice, but it remains a BS one. It would be like a new TV not coming with any inputs, to try and force you to buy the higher model that has a built in Xbox console. You upgrade and get the Xbox and streaming apps, but you better hope you never want a blu-ray player or PS2. In this case it makes it a complete pain in the ass to transfer videos and photos or to clean them up on a larger screen, as the cable connection on phones has always been clunky compared to swapping a MicroSD.1+ OxygenOS is a love hate thing. There are features other phones lack like customizable and music swipe commands, and then there are usually features that work on other phones but for no reason seem to be missing or inaccessible on a 1+.2020 vs 2022:I wasn't overly impressed with my last 1+. It was somewhat glitchy. I've had this phone for about a month so far and it seems to be working great. No major issues or glitchiness happening so far.What I will say is this is a big step up from the N100 I had previously, which seemed quite glitchy.","June 30, 2023"
601,OnePlus 10T Moonstone,Ankita Mitra,5,"When you first consider the price of the OnePlus10t you might be thinking it is overvalued, but when you unbox it and feel that monster charger and incredibly thick charging cable and remember what “other” companies give you in the box, you begin to see it is a really good deal. The charger and cable are worth $125 alone. Great screen, solid build quality, fastest charger ever and good quality cameras make for a good package. Switching from IPhone is dead simple with the included usb-c to usb-a adapter included in the box. If you have an iPhone, make sure you turn off “optimize photos” a day or two in advance so all your full resolution photos download to the phone. I was able to transfer all my photos and all of my messages from iMessage to the Google messages app. This was important to me because I have a lot of saved conversations I want to keep. All apps from your iPhone will download once Android is booted up. Overall, I really like this phone and the best part: this thing charges faster then any electronic device I’ve ever had, it’s unbelievable. Plus, it charged my sons 4th Gen iPad Air super fast, he thought that was pretty cool. It’s just a matter of time before Apple has to start using RCS in iMessage making for a much better texting experience between iOS and Android and you’ll be ahead of the curve. This is a solid buy, get it.FYI: This phone was activated on Verizon by swapping the SIM card from my iPhone 12 Pro Max and putting it in the OnePlus 10t. I was able to get both 4G LTE and 5G, coverage is improved over the iPhone.","October 17, 2022"
602,OnePlus 10T Moonstone,Tibs,5,"Affordable (for a flagship), fast, operational system (just an Android, but slightly tweaked) with a lot of good functions like show download speed or make a do not disturb icon silent... small things for sure, but still things, 120hz screen, 125W charging... this phone is a beast! Paying $649 for 16GB/256GB just makes even better.As cons, there is no wireless charging (which makes no sense, since the best feature this phone has is the impressively fast charging, but anyways) and no type of protection whatsoever. It would be nice to be waterproof and dustproof, especially dustproof, since I have to constantly clean the screen. Knowing that, be sure to buy a case as a bundle. It seems sturdy enough, but better be safe.This is my first time using an Oneplus phone and I'm loving it. Let's hope it keeps that way.","October 3, 2022"

But with the included fast charger, the phone will charge from 10% to 100% in about 20 minutes, so it's not missed. The 16GB phone is super fast, and switches apps seamlessly, and with 256GB of memory there is never a storage issue for me. Overall a great phone.","May 2, 2024"

Convenient and easy to transfer my data from my other phone.I've had some other phones like galaxy and Motorola and likes those as well.

609,OnePlus 10T Moonstone,Alex Kreitz,4,"In general, it's a pretty good phone for the price, 16g of ram, snapdragon 8hen1plus, and very good for gaming, and daily life use, even though the chargeing downgraded from 150w to 125w compared to the Chinese version of 10t,but still very fast, and the battery life is acceptable due to it's mid size 4800mah battery. The main camera is pretty good, but the ultra wide and the Marco... Not good enough. Something that's disappointing is it only have 1 sim card slot, and it doesn't have a free case in the box (btw the Chinese version do have a very good colored soft case depends on what color you are buying) and a screen is a regular 1080p 120hz boe screen without dc dimming or high frequency pwm dimming, so if your eyes are sensitive, maybe it's not the best choice for you. But overall, the best phone you can get on Amazon with the price. (I really recommend you to get the 16g ram version, it will make your phone last longer in the future)","January 14, 2023"
610,OnePlus 10T Moonstone,Matthew Diederichs,3,"I have been loyal to OnePlus since I got the OnePlus 2 in 2015 and I upgraded my phone every year until the OP7Tpro, which I used for two and a half years.I had to replace it after I dropped it and the screen broke, which was a shame because I loved the pop-up camera. But I thought it was time to move on anyway.I looked for OP7Tpro screen repairs but they were too expensive, so I decided to take advantage of this OP deal and buy it without doing much research, trusting the brand.I regret that decision now. This phone does not have a flagship camera, the main camera zoom is blurry, the stabilization software is poor, there is no dual sim card slot. And worst of all, NO ALERT SLIDERS! That was the feature that made OP phones stand out from the rest.I know I could have avoided some of these issues if I had read the descriptions before buying, but I never expected OP to lower their standards so much in their recent phones. Maybe it’s time for me to look for other alternatives.If you are a OP fan like me, you will be disappointed with this phone.","July 13, 2023"

While my Pixel6 is at 300mah and the battery life reflects it.  I usually charge it up to 88% and by the end of the day, I still have about 30-40%.  I typically my phone about 4-5hrs a day.  unlike the pixel, I charge it up 100% and at end of day, I have less than 10%.At $750, it's a great buy.  One thing I noticed was of I set the phone on battery saver, and when it kicks in, it might mess up the wifi or internet connection and I would have turn on/off ✈️ mode.  Now I've disabled that feature, battery life is still great and connection is solid.I would have gotten Samsung but it has bloatware that I can't delete/remove.

No carrier issues so far.*Update* after using this phone for a month I'm still very impressed. Everything still runs smooth and I can't imagine using another phone without the ultra fast charging.Only ran into 2 minor issues. First, I'm not able to register the phone with OnePlus Red Cable Club but this isn't essential, just missing out on the free 3 month extended warranty and promotions. Second, the optimized night charging is always set at 6am. Not sure if this is intended or if it could even be an issue with Android itself. Regardless it doesn't affect the performance of the phone or rate of charging itself.","October 2, 2022"

Or just 5 minutes after daily use. It also slows charging after a few nights if you plug it in every night.Runs smooth and display is good enough when outdoors.I don't play games, but I do use it for banking and browsing the web. Most important things for me are long lasting battery, quick charging, 120hz display, good CPU and not too-large size.For the price this is a good phone.Things that don't matter to me are the phone back made out of metal, memory expansion (current AX Wi-Fi and 5/4G are a better solution for data storage), great camera and brand name.

When Amazon listed this device at 549, I ran out of excuses not to pick it up...The cameras on the phone are more than adequate and I consider myself a fairly competent photographer.. 4K and 8K video is stunning... Battery charging is insanely fast.. better than anything I've ever seen before obviously.. 15 minutes at an airport kiosk will get you up to speed with the supplied 65 watt charger.. just make sure you use the cable that comes with it.. some skinny little cheese cable from the 99 cent store is not going to cut it..The phone is also just the right size.. much lighter and smaller than my v60.. it's a wolf in sheep's clothing and the price is great!You're definitely going to want to purchase a phone case and screen protector.. remember to redo your fingerprint scan or not even set it up until after you get the screen protector on.. many have complained about the fingerprint reader AFTER they have applied a screen protector.. that's not the phone's fault... Just delete the old fingerprint and rescan it with the screen protector in place! It's not that hard.Update*  I've had the phone for a little over 3 weeks now and am still very impressed with it... I get all of the buzz and criticism about camera performance but I have to say again this phone's cameras are beyond adequate.  Performance remains seemless and smooth, with no lag apparent despite multiple apps / functions running together.  All in all a great phone at a great price.","November 25, 2022"
689,OnePlus 10 Pro,Luis Escobar,5,"I've owned the phone for a few months now. Here is my honest review. Battery is a all day battery, I have no problems answering phone calls and texting all day and even watching TikTok and browsing social media. The camera itself is really nice, however the camera tends to get blurry the farther you zoom in to take photos which I understand it doesn't have a long range camera which is OK. The selfie camera in front of the unit is awesome, not many phones have great selfie cameras and it's actually surprising. Now for people claiming it comes with color OS. It does not. It comes with Oxygen OS 12 (Android 12), Color OS is only non US Models. Now I'm a T-Mobile customer, I know TMobile has MMWave Technology, and this phone does not have it. The one thing that really makes up for that is that it can do 5G Support or 4G LTE Support, now 90% of areas I'm in have the 5g support down here in South West Florida. When I'm in towns or busy business areas, doing speed tests on the T-Mobile network, I've gotten between 40 Mbps download to 700 Mbps in select areas and 30 upload to 80 upload which is more then enough and even faster then Xfinity internet...... That I'm paying for in my house..... Honestly going from 4G Support to 5G support on the T-Mobile network really shocked me in coverage and speeds. This phone does support lots of 5g bands and even 4g bands. Now besides network connectivity, battery and the camera this is one solid phone. I came from a Samsung S10+. Now before buying this phone I got the pleasure to play around with the S22 and the One Plus 10 Pro, depending on the deals going on value per dollar will vary. I ended up going with the One Plus 10 Pro since the price, the battery is comparable to the S22 Ultra and is a solid phone. I will give it 4.5 stars due to the zoom features being alittle lack luster. Everything else is solid on the phone. Please note that the One Plus 10 Pro US Model only has one sim card slot, and only supports 65 Watts. At the time of purchase it said 85 watts which is not true. Only the non US Model at this time has 85 Watts and dual sim capabilities.A newer one plus 10 is coming out featuring more ram and more storage so keep an eye out for that too. It may also have more features.","June 14, 2022"
690,OnePlus 10 Pro,RC26271,5,"I have had an iPhone for about 2 years and I was well ready to get back to Android and not have a ton of bloatware. I chose OnePlus for the reputation, and quick charging, and so far this phone has not let me down too much.Charging us fantastic, and the image and video play back has been great, but the camera leaves a lot to be desired. I don't know what it is, but things just don't look right with this camera and I can't seem to adjust in the way that I want, and I am pretty well versed with a DSLR.There is also no sd slot, which is hear breaking, but I got 256gb; let's hope it's enough down the road.Overall, it's been a great phone with great features and yes, I would buy again, but make sure you upgrade to Android 13, cause 12 was bad. also, oxygenOS leaves a lot of be desired. Hopefully they get things fixed down the road, but for now it's just ""ok"" at best.","February 9, 2023"
691,OnePlus 10 Pro,RC26271,4,"BEFORE I GET INTO THE PROS AND CONS OF THIS PHONE I'LL LAY OUT THE BASICS OF WHAT THIS PHONE PROVIDES RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX WHEN YOU FIRST START USING ITThe phone comes with a 65-w supervuuc charger. It also comes with a screen protector pre-installed but no phone case. It has the SIM card tray key included as well with some nomenclature about the phone as well. I bought the American US version and use AT&t service on it. Other reviews mentioned not being able to use AT&t or 5G but that is all in the past as I have 5G on my AT&t service with this phone and it is very fast and works perfectly. Also some people complain about not being able to use Netflix or some other streaming services but they might have not had the US version as I set up all of my streaming services such as netflix, HBO max, hulu, Amazon prime video etc.Also, the software they use for moving data from your old device to this one was the fastest I've ever moved my storage and data as well as phone settings to another phone ever. They did very well on that.PROS:*CAMERA:  The camera is not bad, pretty good in fact but compared to a Samsung or an iPhone it just barely comes up short. Again it is not bad just not as good as a iPhone or Samsung. No one could ever tell the difference when I send them pictures I've taken with this phone or show them. But they are always curious as to what phone I'm using because it is different.*DESIGN AND BUILD:  Phone has a great design, maybe just because it's different from many other phones? It is very slippery though unfortunately as I wish I didn't have to put a case on it. I do like how the material on the back has a mat granite type of look. And I learned to like the camera bump. The build feels very sturdy and does not feel cheap at all. It has a flagship quality build I would say.*PERFORMANCE:  The phone is very fast though, it operates fairly well with everything I threw at it including the most demanding games you can play on a smartphone. The 120 HZ refresh rate is incredibly smooth and can go from one to 120 HZ based on what you are doing and I have never noticed any hiccups. It always felt zippy and fast.Your RAM increase options with the software are also great. I believe I was able to up my ram just using the software to 19 gigs.*BATTERY:  The battery charges very fast and can hold on to that power pretty well throughout the day and halfway through the next. If you are a heavy user and are constantly playing power demanding phone games you will have to charge it at night most likely. I usually charge it in the morning around 20 to 35% while I brush my teeth and get ready and it's done by the time I'm out of the shower. Pretty much 15 minutes will get you to 80 or 90%, which should definitely last you all day unless you ended up using it very heavy, which also you just need to charge it for a little bit again and you'll have another full day. I was able to Outlast my girlfriend's iPhone 13 Max. She always ends up with a low battery unexpectedly as well as me so it is nice not to have to charge it for an hour and a half to two hours to get a full battery. It takes 25 minutes for a full battery 0% - 100% which is nuts. (Although to get it to charge this fast you do have to enable and disable some settings as far as battery health settings go. They do this for people who are worried about the health of their battery as fast charging could supposedly have a negative impact on the battery's long-term health but I find that is not the case and I've been fast charging phones for a couple years.) Let's face it though, at the end of the day our battery levels are almost always between 20 and 30%, so 15 minutes charge and you are pretty much good to go has been a great perk using this phone. Never worried about having a dead phone or not enough battery before going out. It was about 4:00 p.m. and I didn't charge my phone since the morning from the previous day and when my girlfriend told me we had to meet up some friends for a night out but had to leave pretty much right then, I threw my phone on the charger at 12% for a little over 5 minutes and I had 65%. I used it for GPS, video and photos that night and some tipsy phone calls when we got home and I didn't have to charge it until the next day in the afternoon.*SPEAKERS/ MEDIA CONSUMPTION:  The speakers work on both the top and bottom of the phone and sound great. They will definitely get loud enough and don't ever get raspy or have a tinny sound.*CALL QUALITY/ SERVICE/ HOTSPOT:  The call quality on this phone is extremely good. Both the earpiece when receiving calls as well as making calls worked perfectly as far as sound quality. Anyone who I called said it sounded great all the time. I even called my other phones as I have to numbers and it always sounds incredibly good. Hotspot is also easy to set up and I get service everywhere. This thing can get reception and data as best as your carrier can dish it out. 5G works just fine with my carrier AT&t. I saw some other reviews on here saying these phones will not work with at&t, or the 5G doesn't work but AT&t fixed that and OnePlus is fully operational with AT&t's service.*OS AND SOFTWARE:  Because I am not coming from another one plus phone I can't say it is as good, better or worse than the previous operating systems but I can say that they aren't bad at all. Compared to Samsung though, the customization isn't as great, just a little more limited but nothing nearly as restrained as iPhones iOS. Also Android 13 should be coming out in the next month to a few months on the American versions,  But Android 12 still works perfectly fine.  I haven't set up the face unlock on this as I never use it on any phones, except for the iPhone cuz it forces you to but even then I always end up using a code on the iPhone when face unlock doesn't want to work at night or whatever other lame instance. This has a quick and reliable fingerprint reader which I've always loved on phones and honestly wish they at least kept it as another option rather than taking it away.CONS:*BRIGHTNESS:  The brightness is the main issue I have with this phone. It's not terrible but I also use an iPhone 13, Samsung flip and fold 4 and those get very bright. Again it's not terrible but I always have my brightness up to 100 on all my phones. You can still see it just fine during the daylight so it's really not that big of a deal, brightness is just something I like personally when it comes to phones.To be honest, this phone was incredibly easy to set up, use and work with on a daily basis. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good Android phone and would like something different from what's mostly out there. The main takeaway I got from this phone was having a flagship device and never having to worry about the battery or having to charge the battery.I hope this review helped.","December 6, 2022"

693,OnePlus 10 Pro,Chris,1,"I bought this phone through this medium and was thrilled when it arrived, it was fast, powerful, beautiful, it had it all. But then it was showing its shortcomings. Out of nowhere I have software problems where I want to turn on the phone screen, but it is impossible, I pressed and pressed the power button and it does not turn on, after letting it sit for a couple of minutes I noticed that it turns on and off by itself, how reacting to the times I pressed the button. I left it more time to rest and then it came back to normal operation. This has happened to me 3 times already. On the other hand I bought a phone protector from Spigen, it is expensive and specifically designed for this phone, but unlike the product description where they state that the back is made of hard and resistant ceramic, I can confirm that it is a total lie. A few days ago I wanted to remove the phone protector and I discovered that it had 3 cracks on the back, no sense why I have never dropped it on the floor, I take care of my phones with my life, but apparently the phone is not resistant at all, I do not know what happened, I have no idea, but I am extremely disappointed. Unfortunately I discovered all this a little after the end of the 30 days return period, I feel totally ripped off and despite this, I contacted Amazon, as expected they did not help me, but redirected me to contact OnePlus, they told me they would replace it, but that is a lie, OnePlus claims that for purchases within Amazon they are not responsible. Amazon also told me they would help me if OnePlus didn't take care of it, but they didn't, now I have a broken phone that is worth a lot of money. A very bad investment, now I understand why it is always on discount, they are trying to get rid of this phone and the missing stock. DO NOT BUY IT","February 18, 2023"
694,OnePlus 10 Pro,M Hernandez,5,"I'm beyond confused concerning the negative reviews around this phone. For the price the OnePlus 10 pro is hands down the best phone at this price point. I've had everything from the 12 pro max, the Xiaomi Mi 11 ultra, the s22 ultra all costing well over the price of this phone and this phone is just as good. The oxygen experience is fantastic. A clean, lightning fast OS. The camera quality is incredible. The Hasselblad tuning of the camera adds a unique life to photos. Facial unlock is blazing fast, fingerprint scanner blows Pixel 6 pro out of the water.80 watt charger in the box 0-100% in under 30 minutesCase in the box as well?!

It's heavy in the hands and feels like it's built to withstand war.It doesn't feel as good in the hand as a note 20 ultra but feels better in the hand then the S22 Ultra.All in all I absolutely love this phone and the user experience.

695,OnePlus 10 Pro,Tyler,5,"The Phone is a marvel of technology. Everything that was promised by One Plus’s website. However there were irregularities with the shipped device. It was not properly packed. It came inside an Amazon bubble bag and not in a shipping Box as I was expecting it to be, since it is such a wonderful device. Box was in poor condition. The phone box itself was not taped or sealed, which means that it was used, And I purchased it as a “New” device. The box had glue all over, from the tape removal before shipping. Maybe that is why the price for the device was much less than the advertised price on the manufacturer’s website.Device was on Android 12 and still no “OTA” to Android 13 from One Plus as promised. Also the phone is not “Play Protect Certified”. For the lack of good presentation (by the seller) and those other observations (by One Plus), I do not recommend this seller.As far as One Plus is concerned, I was sadly dissatisfied and disappointed, after so many promises. Amazon should make sure that sellers and Manufacturers comply seriously with what they sell using Amazon services.","August 8, 2023"
696,OnePlus 10 Pro,Leif Robert Langford,4,"I was going back and forth on this phone for a while, and I can honestly say that I am happy that I got it. As a long time user of Samsung and Pixel phones on the Android side of things, this is honestly a better phone in almost every way possible- aside from that camera.The unit I received was brand new as described, and it was in perfect working condition. I was able to easily add my SIM card to it and transfer my Google Fi number to this phone in just a few minutes. (Note, this phone does not support eSIM, so you will need a physical SIM card to set it up.) The setup was also very easy and simple to do and has the same data and app transfer option as on other android devices.Once set up, it was still on Android 12 by default, but I did have a large series of updates that took about an hour to fully get it up to the latest release of Android 13. The phone had approximately 7 updates in this time frame.Software:Once fully updated, OxygenOS was a breath of fresh air. For the first time in a long time, I felt like I was using a version of Android that was more customizable than ever as well as giving the default Android-like experience a whole new form. OxygenOS was cleaner and more modern than any other Android skin I've seen, with a translucent app and notification drawer, subtle icon animations when expanding the quick settings, and so much more. Even the built-in clock has a red color for the ""1"" digits as a subtle nod to OnePlus itself. While the entire skin feels smoother than any Android experience I have ever had, it is also the most customizable. You can change the icons to a number of different shapes, sizes, styles, and colors and the same goes for the software color themes, home page screen transitions, the always on display, and even the battery icon style itself. It's an endlessly adjustable software to reflect the style you like the most and I really, really like that. When it comes to ringtones it even has a much higher amount of ringtones I've ever seen preloaded on a phone, and the haptics are out of this world as each ringtone has haptics that respond identically to the tune that is playing. It's just that great and I haven't even mentioned the side quick app drawer or the shelf features. Also, despite being a physical switch, the phone also has a three-way slider above the power button that can instantly switch your phone between Ring, Haptic, and Silent modes as well as muting your audio automatically. It's similar to the silent mode switch on an iPhone but better, in my opinion.Performance:When it comes to performance I was very impressed. Despite the fact that I got the 8GB of RAM model, the phone was snappy and blazing fast. Apps launched in no time and apps scrolled with perfect butter-y action with that 120Hz display. My games were lag free in all that I tried and I am just overall very pleased with the performance.Display:In this phone is an LTPO gen 2 OLED panel that is one of the best I've seen aside from a Samsung phone. Not only is it able to automatically adjust its frame rate to conserve battery life, but it does it in a way that you wouldn't otherwise notice. There is no hitching or stuttering or weird glitches from the display shifting its frame rate and it is just a flawless experience. Not only that, the display is incredibly vivid, detailed, and bright and I didn't notice any color shifting like on some lower quality OLED panels. The HDR looks great, and the screen is super immersive. You will not be disappointed when playing games or watching content as it is one of the best displays I have seen. However, I am not the biggest fan of the curved edges as I prefer a flat display but the edges of the display are not too troublesome or as curved as some others.Battery Life:At first I was slightly worried that the battery wasn't going to be good as despite its exceptionally fast charging speeds, my phone was depleting charge extremely fast the first few days that I had it. In the days since, the battery has held up much better with somedays giving me as much as triple the screen on time compared to when I first got it. I assume that this is from the adaptive battery functionality finally optimizing itself based on how I use my phone and what apps I run, but it is something to take note of as you must give the phone a few days to get this kind of battery life. Presently, I am able to use it all day with about 30% charge left around bedtime. Now, the most standout feature about this phone is its charging capabilities. From a near 0 charge, this phone can almost completely get back to 100% in just 30 minutes which is crazy to me as I am used to phones taking anywhere from 1 hour to 2 hours to fully charge. So, if you just need a quick charge, just plug this in for a few minutes and you'll get a couple hours of screen time. It's that fast. If you prefer to charge wirelessly, it will also support insanely fast wireless charge speeds, but you have to make sure your wireless charger is capable of putting out the necessary wattage.Speakers:The speakers on this phone are very good. While they don't get as loud as I would like, they do deliver fuller and more natural sounding audio compared to other phones I have used. Voices sound crisp and clear, and music sounds detailed and rich. The only disappointment I have with the speaker aside from the volume level is that the bass is not very noticeable, but this isn't that much of an issue to me. The speakers deliver what I would describe as a mostly ""flat"" or otherwise balanced sound EQ.Build Quality:This is also without a doubt one of the most comfortable phones I have ever used. Even though I usually put a case on all of my devices, this is probably the only one I would consider using without one. The back of the phone has this unusual but incredibly well done powdered granite-like feel as the frosted matte finish is soft and soothing against the hands. It doesn’t look or feel like glass at all as it feels more like a soft stone, and the best part is this finish doesn’t leave fingerprints of any kind which means you don’t need to constantly wipe it down. It also gives it a slight amount of grip to hold as it isn’t slippery. Despite not being a fan of curved edges, the design of the phone is not too narrow or too wide which allows it to fit almost perfectly in my hands as if it was naturally designed for them. The phone is also very light weight despite all that is packed inside of it, and I just really think the design, feel and weight of the phone is one of the best I have ever used.Camera:We are finally at the weakest part of the entire phone. Despite the Hasselblad partnership, the cameras on this phone just can't quite live up to the photos taken on other Android phones such as the Pixel series or Galaxy Ultra phones. It gets even worse when you compare the selfie cameras as the photos taken by this phone are extremely soft and lack detail. While the rear camera can still take some fairly good photos, it is more of a ""luck of the draw"" as sometimes it will capture a good photo and other times it will not. Videos are even worse. While most android phones have never really been that good when it comes to video, there is something noticeably wrong with the videos I record with this phone. It's like all the saturation got turned up to a 1000 as the colors are way over done compared to real life in addition to all the shadow details being crushed with nothing but pure black. It's still usable to make a quick post, but I would not recommend using it to record videos for content creation. Overall, it is not the worst camera by any means as it is still fairly good, but it just doesn't live up to my expectations.Overall, this is an excellent phone that when on sale, I would say is better than almost anything else aside from the camera. At the current sub-500 cost, the performance, battery life, display quality, and software experience is unrivaled. The only thing that hurts the value in my opinion is the camera, but it excels in almost every other category. I highly recommend it.","September 10, 2023"

My old phone was busted pretty bad so when I got this one I was super worried my SIM from Verizon wouldn't work, but I slapped it right in and it worked immediately! As for the phone, OnePlus is one of the BEST phones I've ever used. I used to have an 8 and traded it in. (Which I regret) so I had to go back and get one again, the 10 Pro is very user friendly, and has very good quality cameras. It charges insanely fast and rarely gets hot/overheats.

I've been using the phone heavily for a few days now and the battery life has been excellent, lasting me through the entire day without needing to recharge.Overall, I think the OnePlus 10 Pro is an incredible value for money.

708,OnePlus 10 Pro,Michael Chang,3,"First off I like this camera. 30x is actually amazing.However, without access to MSM and edl firehose etc I am kinda disappointed.Basically if you brick your device doing any development there are two options open it up to do a hardware jumper bypass or send it back to OnePlus. The new MSM tool uses a unique key pair for each phone that links to oopos servers for the private key. So you need oopo credentials. While I'm sure someone will find a way eventually I'm not able to provide much in the way of research with my current situation. Their merger with oopo has been a failure there's things that I just can't tolerate with oos like the relatively weak encryption and security standards. Which are admittably Android standard. I apologize to Amazon but I'll have to send this one back I'll probably be buying an even older OnePlus.","June 17, 2023"
709,OnePlus 10 Pro,RC26271,2,"What i liked about this phone was the excitement of MORE 5G bands than my 8 Pro, but that was very short lived. Swapped sim cards and only saw 4G+, not 5G like my wifes 4 year old Samsung S20+.Samsung gets 121Mbps down & 55Mbps up. This phone got 27 down and 16 up. Looks like 4G!The rear camera is just pure trash. Bulky, 20 thousand lenses and at half zoom, its actually 0.6, not 0.5 like the 8 Pro. The colors are dull no matter what setting to use, basically, the 8 Pro has 5x better camera in quality, color and size-to-phone!. Face recognition is not very good, no matter what angle its barely working. Same for the fingerprint sensor, i've redid my finger 6 times and only worked few times. 8 Pro, zero issues, even with greasy finger!Battery, holds good because its a NEW PHONE! My 8 Pro holds over a day of normal use. Android 12, complete garbage as always, no Lockscreen lock timer, no extra sensitivity option with gloves on, many features gone. Starting to think this is actually a CHINESE CLONE...The 120Hz screen has issues also, scrolling through chrome pages i can see it goes down to 90Hz, not pure smoothness like the 8 Pro.I didn't test the call quality because the 5G doesnt work so i dont care!

714,OnePlus 10 Pro,Sesilos,2,"I love this phone but it's been the worse to personalize. I've had it for 3 days now and still have several settings that I've not setup, not found, or have wrong. This is due to the fact that NO USER MANUAL or anything of use was supplied- not even the phone case or screen protector listed to be in the box. The Quick Start Guide only shows where buttons are located... something my 1yo granddaughter knows, not one thing mentioned for features, settings, etc. After deciding to check the seller's listing (as if I read wrong), it does say the screen protector and case are missing and I found the 20pg User Manual as a PDF file also. Now I must go step by step to backtrack customizing and personalizing settings which seems more complicated than when I (as an Android user) setup my grandson's iPhone without need for instructions. This phone has alternative names for features within a feature of simple things that requires you to figure out what's being referenced-especially without the manual. I upgraded from OnePlus 7 Pro so the terms of stupidity used for simple features or settings within features is extremely unnecessary. Other than that and what WASN'T in my box as specified, the phone's fine... just catching the devil trying to find a screen protector and case now.

Many noticications aren't shown at all, and you have to unlock the phone to see only SOME of them.On the bright side, the screen looks good and the touch works well so far (bought the phone 4-5 months ago).All in all, the bad fingerprint reader is a good enough reason NOT to buy this phone in my opinion.","January 14, 2024"

It is a real powerhouse.  It did take me a bit of effort to customize it to my personal tastes, but now it is exactly the way I prefer.

729,OnePlus 10 Pro,RC26271,1,"I purchased the OnePlus 10 Pro 5G (256GB, 12GB RAM, Factory Unlocked - China Version with Google Play, Black) about four months ago. Regrettably, my experience has led to more frustration than satisfaction.Short-Lived Functionality: Remarkably, the phone only worked properly for a mere four months. For a device of its caliber and price range, this is a significantly shorter lifespan than expected.Display Issues: The most severe problem is with the display, which became increasingly unresponsive over time and now fails to turn on at all. This critical issue has rendered the phone unusable.Battery Drain: Additionally, the battery performance was subpar. I noticed that the battery would drain at an alarmingly fast rate, which is a significant inconvenience and not what you expect from a new smartphone.Biometric Failures: Both the fingerprint reader and face recognition features have been disappointingly unreliable. The fingerprint reader ceased functioning correctly within a few months, and the face recognition was inconsistent right from the beginning.Overall Reliability: These issues collectively raise serious doubts about the reliability and quality control of this model. It's a letdown, especially from a brand like OnePlus, which is known for its quality smartphones.Advice to Potential Buyers: Please exercise caution if you're considering this phone. My experience suggests that it might not live up to the expected standards of a flagship model in terms of durability and performance.

If I have one complaint, it would be, I wish a little more instruction came on different functions, but I guess that's the fun of a new phone. So, in conclusion, I give this phone a 4.8 in stars.

759,OnePlus 9 Pro,Damon Bull,5,"This is a fabulous phone, and why it gets 5 stars.  Scren is great.  Fingerprint and face unlock is great.  Super fast on 5G.  I'm very happy now that I have gotten it to work.But a couple of warnings:If you are a Sprint customer who thinks you are a T-Mobile customer, you are NOT!  You are still on the Sprint telecommunications network, even though you are able to also use the T-Mobile towers.  This phone, no matter what you do, WILL NOT ACTIVATE on the Sprint network.  Not even in any kind compatibility mode.  Sprint's activation and registration software and systems identifies this phone as a FOREIGN device and there is NO WAY to activate the IMEI number range this phone has been assigned on the Sprint network.  Don't waste your time trying!  I tried 3 different ways.  Not happening!The only way I could get the phone to activate was to open up a T-Mobile account and transfer my number over.  If you are a single phone line Sprint customer and do not have any balance owed on yourphone, this is an easy thing to do.  And you should do it.  The phone activates instantly on the T-Mobile network.But if you have any balance on your Sprint account for any of your active lines, you will need to pay all of those balances off to zero them before you can move over to T-Mobile.  Again, another wonderful side affect of the Sprint and T-Mobile accounting systems not yet being compatible.Again, if you have been a Sprint customer, you are not yet a T-Mobile customer.  Not until you have switched your account.  At this point, this has to be done by you.  And can not be done if you still have outstanding balances (lease, payments) for your phone on Sprint.  T-Mobile is not doing this automatically yet.  The Sprint phone support I talked to said that there may be some work starting offering deals to get Sprint customers converted over the holidays.  So look for that.Lastly, two days after I bought the phone, Amazon lowered the price by $100.  I chatted with the Amazon Customer support team to see if I could get a refund of the difference in prices.  Again, NOT HAPPENING!  It's not in Amazon's customer service policy to refund differences in prices for your purchases when they happen in just a 2 day period.  I could understand a longer duration, like 5 or more days.  But TWO DAYS?  Really?  I have had experience with a large number of brick-and-mortor retailers that would happily refund the difference in purchase price when an items prices are reduced shortly after purchase.  So, be warned that Amazon does not have a customer service policy like this and seems to not have any way to offer a customer pleasing exemption.I guess I could take some comfort in the idea that my non-refunded $100 could go towards more rocket fuel for Jeff Bazos' next trip into space.","July 23, 2021"
760,OnePlus 9 Pro,J Elliott,5,"The build quality is solid, and premium feeling in the hand. It has some weight to it, but is still less than say an iPad Mini.Performance wise, I have been able to play some Guitar Hero 3 for Wii (using the right adapters of course) in Dolphin - surprisingly solid performance and now capable of jamming while on the road. Standard mobile games and most applications will not stretch the specs on this one, but emulators definitely will. I have paired this with an amazingly thin case and the Razer Kishi controller for the ultimate emulation and streaming beast on the go.My choice came down to price, as I was originally going to go with the Sony Xperia 1 III. That choice also lost me some options in the process such as the awesome 3.5mm jack and DAC combo, and the micro SD slot (I have multiple ranging from 128GB to 1TB for storage away from my server (away from civilization)). Sony is the only top end option for those points but at nearly double the price that I bought the OnePlus 9 Pro at. 256GB of storage will be a little thin for my uses but I can manage.TL;DR - for the price, this is the best top-end phone of 2021. Emulation, photography, and overall performance and longevity make this one hard to beat.","October 24, 2021"

762,OnePlus 9 Pro,Nexx,1,"**This review has been deleted by amazon or oneplus 5 times.**This is a complete bait and switch. The device is sold with Oxygen OS (android 11), but a recent update delivered as a ""standard security update"" completely wipes the device, changing the OS to ColorOS (which is inferior and lacks features that Oxygen has).  The user is given zero warning  about this update, and it is sold as simply moving the android security update to the 03/2022 release.  It is infact a complete OS change.Features you lose:1.  Ability to remove some oneplus' bloatware2.  Ability to rename applications/disable3.  Paid apps fail to launch in the new Android 12 ""color os"" (These are up-to-date apps certified to work with Android 12 that fail in OnePlus's junk ColorOS, which is the cannibalized OS used in their Chinese products (brought in when they were purchased/merged with Oppo)4.  The OS lacks substantial features present in in the version this product is sold with. Headphones, camera, and bluetooth audio all failed with legitimate (and previously working) apps.5.  The OTA (over the air) update that changed Oxygen to ColorOS also deleted several personal files (desktop wallpaper, and files in the root of the phone outside standard directories).6.  Battery life is worse after the update as well.  It was already pretty terrible (see other reviews here).  This device drinks power and will require multiple recharges a day if you use the high resolution display / high refresh rate.This is relevant to Amazon purchasers, because you will be sold a device that appears/functions one way, and then magically overnight, an update will cripple the device.  You can revert the update, but it is not trivial (a factory reset will not save you)Amazon will likely delete this review again, even though I am a verified purchaser.  The critique of this phone is fair and honest. If OnePlus cared about its customers, it would address the egregious trust violations in their system update (and acknowledge the horrible battery life of the device).  Instead, Amazon and OnePlus will likely simply continue to delete my review.","April 7, 2022"
763,OnePlus 9 Pro,paul,4,"I got this after using multiple Samsung and Google phones, all of which had their own issues. After using it for some time, here are my impressions with both good and not so good parts.Good parts:- The build quality is good, the phone feels great in hand and has some weight to it, unlike phones like Google Pixel 5 which feels like a cheap toy. You can also watch video by JerryRigEverything, this phone does not bend easily with very strong frame.- The display quality is good, especially pixel density, which is 525 ppi. I have tried phones with lower pixel density such as Pixel 5, they're ok if your vision is good but if you have nearsightedness and have to use phone close to your face you will easily notice individual pixels on phones with lower pixel density. On OnePlus 9 Pro you will not have this issue.- The OS is better than on Samsung phones. It is close to stock, there is no bloat like on Samsung phones, many apps can be uninstalled except apps like Gallery or Netflix. It is close to Pixel phone OS, except the launcher on OnePlus is better than Google's own launcher because you can do more customizations like remove Google search bar (I don't use it) or remove stock widget from home screen (you can't do this on Pixel phones unless you will use different launcher) or do more customizations in terms of adding different icons or changing colors. OnePlus also uses stock Google dialer and messages apps, they are much better than Samsung's apps because they filter spam much better and Google's dialer has integrated visual voicemail (this feature depends on your provider, it works on Verizon but might not work with some other provider) and Google's messages app has support for RCS messaging which you can enable even if your carrier does not want to. You can also customize features such as adding black bar on top of display to hide front camera, something that Samsung used to allow but then they disabled this feature in One UI 3. The OnePlus launcher also looks better from visual point of view compared to Samsung's One UI - Samsung really overdid ""rounded corners"" on every pop-up message box and every menu in their phones, I really dislike it. OnePlus launcher has much less pronounced ""rounded corners"" in menus and message boxes which look better and hopefully something that OnePlus will never change.- The fingerprint reader works good for me, much more reliable than what I have seen on Samsung phones with their under display fingerprint readers. Just be aware that third-party screen protectors may interfere with it.- The cameras produce good photo quality, especially after latest updates. Initially the photo quality was pretty poor as you can see from all old reviews, but OnePlus has released many updates which increased the photo quality to good levels. It's still not as good as on Pixel phones but very close and with more updates will probably get even better.- The battery life is good after all recent updates. Both the standby and use time with display on are pretty good and better than similar models from Samsung. This will probably get even better with more updates by OnePlus.Not so good parts:- The phone is pretty expensive, especially without good trade-in programs. You can find Galaxy S21+ for cheaper price, especially with great trade-in program that Samsung offers.- The phone still has some software bugs which are not fixed, such as bugs with bluetooth which affects some people or bugs with automatic brightness adjustment. All of those will probably fixed with future updates but the phone should not have been released with those bugs.- The phone has SnapDragon 888 processor, it is known for high power consumption which creates high heat output. It affected many phones including phones from Samsung and also affected this model. The manufacturers are still trying to adjust this processor's power consumption in their phones, Samsung already does it well but OnePlus has not reached their level yet. You may still see overheat warnings on this model if you live in a warm climate and do things like filming 4k video at high fps. I personally hasn't experienced it but you may find other examples of it. This is something you need to be aware of before buying it.","June 4, 2021"

766,OnePlus 9 Pro,kitchen diva,3,"As a long time fan of the OnePlus brand and owner of the OP 1, 3, 6, 7 pro and now 9 Pro, I find this model to be wanting and somewhat unimpressive. I've been using this for over 2 months and here is my review especially when compared to the OP 6 and 7 pro.Design - nice finish, smooth and a bit slippery but I have it in a case now. It's a lot heavier and bulkier than I expected.Display - excellentSound: Speakers - very loud, crystal clear and impressive quality and surround sound.Sound: Earbuds (wired and wireless) - not as good as the OP6 possibly due to the usb-c and wireless (I use sony wired and wireless headsets).Camera - The Hasselblad is excellent quality for near and far images. Excellent photo and video quality.Gaming: very fast and smooth with no visual lagBattery life: less than I expected as I get the same from my OP6 and 7. I was expecting a lot more hours as I have even less apps installed.Dual sim: disappointing. I ordered the US version as I'm in NY an all previous models were dual sim however this US version does not have dual sim. While I understand this to be more due to regulation and not the fault of OP, I think this should be explicitly stated in the title as I now have to use 2 phones and will be giving up this one for the 10 pro this week.Overall performace: good. Phone is fast but not much faster than the OP6 with less cores, RAM and storage.OS: it's ok but nothing to really stand out. The OS and feel are exactly the same as the older models. No exclusive apps but I guess that lessens the bloatware.Call clarity: very goodOverall Pros - display, sound (only via built-in speakers), amazing camera.Overall Cons - bulky, heavy, no dual-sim and less than impressive audio and volume using wired and wireless headsets.I've purchased the OP 10 Pro and will give an opinion compared to the OP6 and OP 9 Pro. Cheers.","August 22, 2022"
767,OnePlus 9 Pro,Lex,4,"Loved the speed and memory. The warp charge is insane and charges my phone so fast, I only get one episode of netflix in before i check on it.Battery life - very respectable. Maybe charge it at the end of the day with heavy use.Gaming mode - pretty nice, made Pokemon go look snazzy and phone games popped, while also minimizing battery use.Pro-tip: get a clear backed phone case, because this phone is actually pretty to look at.Disliked the camera, which was a major selling point for this phone. Scenic photos, it's great! Night mode struggles and close-up photos struggle to stay in focus. It's like the phone wants to focus, but doesn't. Kind of like me.[Please keep in mind: this review comes from a tech-pleb. You may like it better.]","May 15, 2024"
768,OnePlus 9 Pro,SP,2,"Latest Update (<2yrs of use):It turns out that this model is NOT IP67 water resistant.  Any exposure to moisture (even short term) will affect this phone.  Also - the length of this handy makes it prone to twisting and in my case affected the sound (went from stereo to mono).  You could tell because the slightest twist along the long axis would make stereo sound come back.The latest thing that happened was that it acted up and started to be unresponsive to touch.  Application suddenly opened, random text started appearing, etc; Since it was unresponsive I couldn't stop it from going haywire.Well... it took less than 2 years to realize that I wasted money. At least the wireless charger is still functioning.Original review:Have you ever fallen in love with something only to see the manufacturer discontinue it.  (If you are a Google user then - yes, you would know:-). I was a huge fan of the Nexus phones from Google and it broke my heart when they discontinued the series in favor oF the pixels.  I've been in search of a replacement ever since having tried Samsung, LG and even a Pixel3xl.  The Pixel was nice in the beginning  but endless updates from Google made the phone so unstable that I started looking around again.This One+ 9 Pro is finally the phone I was looking for. Sleek, great screen, fast and once in a proper case, very comfortable to handle (without case it is too slick for me).I got the wireless warp charger for it (~$35) and boy... it charges the phone from 15% to 100% in 20 minutes.  I've never seen anything like that.  The battery lasts me 2 days and I do use it a lot, albeit, probably not as much as the younger generation. The cameras are awesome.  Great quality pictures and videos (without jerking).The only thing that I wonder about is the update frequency of the OS.  It's been almost 6 months since Android 12 was released and the manufacturer is still only on 11.  I'd like to think that they do more testing than Google to avoid the problems that caused me to loose faith in the Pixel3XL in the first place.My phone is a version LE2125 (unlocked on Verizon).  Transferring my data from the old phone was a breeze via Bluetooth.(Edit: just a few days later, the android 12 update came down)","March 24, 2022"
769,OnePlus 9 Pro,Damon Bull,3,"I ordered this phone expecting it to be the LE2125 model, as listed in the description.  What I received was a model number LE2127.  The LE2125 is the factory unlocked model while the LE 2125 is a T-Mobile phone that was unlocked.  First of all, the LE2127 has the T-Mobile bloatware and the T-Mobile boot animation but more importantly, they have different 5G bands and capabilities.  This is shown in the attached image.  The LE2125 is on the left and it supports 9 of the 10 5G bands.  The LE2127 is on the right and it only supports 7 of the 10 5G bands.  (The image shows 17 supported bands for the LE2125 and 8 for the LE2127 but I think the difference is due to bands not available in the US, but I'm not sure).  I wanted the OnePlus 9 Pro with the greatest 5G band compatibility, which is the LE2125, but that is not what I received.On the plus side, the phone is in very nice condition for a refurbished phone and seems to be working as intended.  I'll update this if I notice any other issues.","December 28, 2022"
770,OnePlus 9 Pro,J Elliott,2,"I am frequently in places where I don't want the phone to ring and the physical slide switch on the side of this phone was what convinced me to buy this particular phone.  However, the switch does not work - any alarm I have set will cause the phone to sound the audible alarm even when the phone is set to ""silent mode"".  When I set the switch to silent, the phone screen confirms that it is on silent mode, but the alarms still sound.Even if I POWER DOWN the phone, the phone will turn on by itself and sound the alarm tone when the time for the alarm occurs.  Obviously there is no way to actually turn this phone off.  If I could remove the battery I would but that's not practical every time I go into a doctor's office.I have been in contact with tech support and they have not been able to correct this major defect.  In fact, both of the times they made suggestions regarding what to do, their instructions for what to change in my settings do not apply to my phone.  They tell me what screen to go into and what setting to change, but that setting does not exist on my phone.So, zero stars for OnePlus tech support.","February 11, 2023"

If you only have 8gb you have a Chinese version which will work with most carriers in US so it can fool a person. The US version should work with all carriers so if your having issue with it working and can't figure out you prob have Chinese. ..ALSO if you use the Alexa app or smart devices connected to Alexa DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE either version. One plus did an update that now Alexa app will not open just freezes and crashes. Been this way for 2 months now. Amazon rep tried to figure it out with me for about an hour.

It was not, not even a little bit was it the American version of the one plus 9 pro..The one plus 9 pro (us spec) only had one sim. I had to run the model number through countless Google searches and three different cell carries before I got the phone to work, and work is a loose word. I have no service in places my one plus 6 did, I love the phone but the experience was and still is a disaster.The display is wonderful, it's snappy, and takes amazing pictures, it charges super fast, and self optimizes charging durning the night it's actually an amazing phone.

It charges insanely fast, but still, the battery life is a serious disappointment.Another gripe is when the phone updates, it messes up the screen / app layout.  Just when you get everything laid out nice...Camera and video is very good.In summary, battery life is a deal killer.  The phone itself is overkill to a large degree factoring in the price.  I think there are other less expensive phones just as good from a practical perspective, like one of the Google pixel phones. I bought one for my son when I got this, and his is thinner smaller, better battery.","August 11, 2022"

I'm surprised it only lasted me this long I might need to be thinking of getting a new phone in the next 4 to 6 months max. I do not recommend it, even though I have not encountered performance problems, this being the pro version, having extra memory and storage, but still the battery is a big problem, especially at this kind of price point.

I was also about to return this phone but kept it and I am happy with how it works.  One thing that does get old is that the sensor detects if you have you hand over the screen, which I have to switch hands sometimes and it covers my viewing area.  The other is that the camera does launch on its own every now and then.  So far, I'm very happy after the update.","December 1, 2021"

791,OnePlus 9 Pro,Jessica Euceda,1,"I will never, ever even consider buying another one of these garbage can phones ever again. In 6 months it has proven to be the worst phone I've owned in almost 20 years of owning cell phones. And realistically, the hardware is fine, it's the garbage can operating system that truly raises the bar on awfulness. The very first system update from about 5 or 6 months ago rendered the phone unable to connect to any network so I had to factory reset the phone and restore everything from backup, so it was a complete waste of time. After that I've been avoiding any repeat of a system update because I shudder to imagine whatever deleterious effect it will have now. And then today it decided to spontaneously restart and I lost network connections yet again, although the system has not been updated. I can't recommend staying away from this useless garbage enough. I've already told my friends and family to stay away from and avoid One+ like the plague. Now excuse me while I go get a new phone.","May 25, 2022"

Also it came pre-setup with a Chinese account logged in and I had to use my old phone's menus as reference to change it to English so I could use it easier.Update (12/04/2021) - The RAM makes all the difference, runs significantly worse and inconsistently than my 12GB OP8 I had. I already gave that as a hand-me-down so I'm stuck with this 8GB OP9Pro.

858,OnePlus 8 Pro,Mark,5,"I upgraded to the OnePlus 8 from a Pixel 2XL, and I have thoroughly enjoyed this phone so far! I was a little hesitant buying this phone (with some complaining about the camera, and so many other phones releasing this fall), but this phone has surpassed my expectations! I wasn't interested in the OnePlus 8 Pro because of the larger size/weight and more expensive price tag. The OnePlus 8 is close to the size of my Pixel 2XL, which is big enough for me. Personally, I don't really care about wireless charging or water resistance. Also, I read the pro has a more prominent waterfall screen (the screen wraps around the sides of the phone more), which I was not interested in.The screen is big and beautiful! The hole punch camera doesn't bother me at all, and I forget it is there most of the time. The 90hz screen was a huge selling point for me, and is a huge upgrade from a 60hz screen. It really makes the phone feel buttery smooth.Speaking of buttery smooth, this phone will handle anything you throw at it! The combination of the beefy specs (emphasis on the 8gb/12 gb of RAM) and OxygenOS make for an amazing experience. I am not a big mobile gamer, but I did try PUBG to check out the 90 fps mode, which works and gameplay is smooth/fluid.The battery life has been fantastic. It will definitely get though an entire day with heavy usage. The included 30w fast charger will charge up your phone super quick if you are in a rush. The phone also has battery optimization options that will help prevent the battery from degrading overtime.The on-screen fingerprint reader is very fast and I rarely have issues unlocking the phone. I have not tried face recognition, because I just prefer the fingerprint reader.The stereo speakers are pretty great, and I have no issues with the sound quality. I mostly use Bluetooth Bose earbuds with the phone, and haven't had any connection issues at all.The build quality is very premium and feels like a $1000 phone. Hepatic feedback (vibration) is something people overlook in reviews, and it feels great and is subtle. The power and volume buttons also feel nice and clicky. The power button on the Pixel 2 XL felt spongy, and sometimes wouldn't even register me pressing it (it was super annoying). The notification slider (ring/vibrate/silent) is useful and should be on more Android phones. The glass back also makes the phone feel premium, but it is super slippery. It is also a fingerprint magnet (interstellar glow). So maybe slap a case or a D-Brand skin on the back (although the interstellar glow looks beautiful).In my opinion, the camera is not nearly as bad as some people are saying. It still takes high quality photos, and software updates will only make it better. It isn't as easy as the pixel 2XL's camera and camera software, but it has potential! It definitely isn't on par with the OnePlus 8 pro or other $1000 phones, but it gets the job done. I am definitely not a photographer or photography enthusiast, so if you are looking for a phone that takes the best photos, maybe go with the OnePlus 8 pro. Also, the 2MP macro camera on this phone is pretty pointless (which may be my only negative point in this review). I know some people were having issues with the selfie camera (reports of blurry/fuzzy images), but I haven't had any problems with it so far.Overall, this is exactly the phone I wanted. A super fast phone (high specs and 90hz screen) that I didn't pay $1000+ for. I will never be able to go back to a phone with a 60hz screen!","September 3, 2020"
859,OnePlus 8 Pro,Dylan Whisnant,5,"This is my second Oneplus smartphone as I’m moving from the 6 to 8 and I’ve found a home with OnePlus. It may not have the name recognition in the USA that some of the other well-known brands do (Apple, Samsung, LG, Motorola, etc.) but now that more carriers are starting to adopt the brand in the states (Verizon & T-Mobile) it’s only a matter of time before it’s mentioned in the same breath as the Iphone or a galaxy. It has already topped many of the best phones of 2020 lists and for good reason. This phone is a beast, plain and simple. Whatever you throw at it, it can handle it plus more. Navigation in buttery smooth with a 90hz refresh rate screen. It’s got all the hardware you want under the hood with the latest Snapdragon processor on the market, 12GB of memory and 256GB of storage in the model I went with. It runs Android 10 with OxygenOS 10 UI which has always been good about giving the user great performance without shoving bloatware down your throat (it’s there but not in your face) They went away from the notch on the 6 and moved to a hole punch selfie camera on the 8 which really opens up the screen space.  The rear cameras are high-powered topping out at 48MP and takes superb pictures and videos. The 4300 mAh battery has already lasted me a complete day and some change including a twelve-hour shift at work as an IT professional when I’m constantly using my phone to perform tasks. The warp charger is insanely fast as I can go to empty to a full charge in about 45 minutes. What it lacks, I don’t miss. The headphone jack is no more from the 6 but most all phones have said goodbye to that relic from yesteryear. I don’t want to pay a premium for an IP68 rating (just get a SUPCASE Unicorn Beetle case and thank me later) nor do I care about wireless charging. If those things are important to you, pay the extra $100-200 and upgrade to the OnePlus 8 Pro. While the phone is 5g capable, unless you’re on T-Mobile, you will likely only see 4G LTE if you’re like me (AT&T) since the device is ahead of the carriers in terms of coverage and compatibility. The best Android experience around all at an affordable price point in the top tier of flagship devices. This is the smartphone you want. Don’t hesitate and purchase with supreme confidence.Pros• Smooth 90hz refresh rate• Snapdragon 865• 256GB of Storage and 12GB of memory• GSM Unlocked (AT&T, T-Mobile, etc)• Fast 30w WARP charging• 5G capable• Great picture quality• In screen fingerprint reader• Price is still exceptional compared to other flagship phones with similar specsCons• No IP68 dust/water resistant rating• Storage not expandable• No headphone jack• Lacks wireless charging• 5G currently only compatible on T-Mobile","June 17, 2020"
860,OnePlus 8 Pro,Mark,5,"I've been a Pixel person for many years now, but didn't have many options for an unlocked phone with near stockish Android and decent battery life.I will start by saying the phone doesn't have Alexa installed and it isn't required. Anyone giving it a poor review for that is misinformed.This phone seemed to be a better fit than a newer Pixel, but I was concerned with camera quality. The photos I've taken look really great and the camera app is very similar to the others I've used. I've taken several hundred pics since owning the phone and they have turned out almost as good (in some cases even better) than the ones taken with my Pixel 2 XL.I've installed all of my apps and been using it heavily and it gets significantly better battery life than my other phones. This was a big complaint and one of my primary reasons to upgrade. The screen on the 8 is really bright in Auto and adjusts well to surrounding light. Leaving the phone to adjust automatically has been fine most of the time and I rarely change it myself.The Warp Charging is absolutely amazing. Plugging it in for a short amount of time charges the battery up enough to use for hours. This wasn't really a huge selling point for me, but it did make me quite happy when I used it.The build quality and looks are impressive too. It just feels like a premium phone. The Interstellar Glow is an interesting color choice and it looks sogood in person. Any clear case will show off it's iridescent shine.Software has been a big win here. The simplicity of stock Android has always been appealing to me and getting away from that has been hard. You don't realize how much you were missing until you start using something like Oxygen OS on a OnePlus phone. You can change the icons on the entire phone with icon packs downloaded from Play Store. You can change the status bar, system icons, the color and shapes. So many things can be customized and it is so smooth.I was worried that I would spend the money to be let down, but this has been a great purchase. I'm happy with it and can't say enough good things about my new phone.","June 8, 2020"
861,OnePlus 8 Pro,Weaze the Wize,4,"Pro:Price good deal for the spec.Fast processor, sharp amoled screen.Fingerprint is good.Oxygen OS is like stock android, pretty easy to use.Camera software is good, like how it handle light source.Dual sims, unlocked, compatible with AT&T, Tmobile and Verizon (yes IMEI checked out with verizon)Fast charging, yes faster than Iphone 13. It has smart charge software control, can prolong charging for less heat. Battery life is good.Con: Some cons are subjective as compared to my previous phone (Huawei Mate 20)Fingerprint is on screen, less sensitive than my old phone which had dedicated finger print sensor behind the phone.Battery life seems less than my old phone, this is strange since Oneplus 8 has high endurance rating than the Mate 20. Could also due to Kirin chipset throttling better at power management.Oxygen OS has some quirks, just need to play with the settings e.g. default messaging app has MMS turned off for group texting. It would send individual sms to each recipient by default, or no way to close default music app locked in top notification bar without force stop.Heat dissipation/distribution: During initial setup, notice Oneplus 8 heat felt in one region of the phone. My old phone distribute and dissipate heat better. This is only a concern under intense usage, no heat issue during normal usage.No 3.5mm jack.No memory card slot.Speaker: playing music has tiny distortion from the vibration of the back plate. This effect is little, only affects certain type of music.Overall is good deal for the price.","February 11, 2022"

It was a solid week after I received it before I put a SIM card in it and started carrying it because I needed the time to modify and secure it, and test it to be certain it WAS secure and would not spy on me.The phone, out of the box, cooperated with my efforts to modify it.  It was not filled with bloatware to begin with, but also could be easily rooted and then modded at a deep level...many brands (*koff samsung*) fight you on this.  I have now been carrying it for almost 3 years and it has functioned perfectly.Camera is very good.  Not the best I guess but certainly good enough for me.I run the battery between 75% charge and 35% charge which is good enough to take me through the day (given that my mods keep all the spyware from running) and consequently the battery has shown no signs of deterioration.I was a bit leery of a chinese phone, which the OnePlus certainly is, but I have encountered no trouble controlling it and it does not contain any hidden spyware or backdoors.I'm a software developer and expert in pretty much all aspects of the technologies that you need to understand in order to understand, analyze, monitor, and control these phones, so if there was something untoward going on I would know about it by now.I recommend the OnePlus brand based on my experience with this device.  If nothing has changed with later phones, this brand is an excellent deai.","June 25, 2024"
863,OnePlus 8 Pro,Gregory S,5,"I'll just begin by saying this is the best device on the planet. Obviously, it's bro is due very soon. However, it will remain at the top of any list this year and beyond. I do not purchase devices based on cameras or camera performance. So, my review pertains to its strength based on its purpose, and performance, as a phone. I understand that may not be a popular position, and it doesn't mean that I won't mention camera functionality. Here's my short. Its display is brilliant. Colors are excellently saturated, and it produces a three dimensional picture. Sometimes, I think it's more entertaining watching videos, and movies, on my devices. I can't say that it's a result of its 120-hertz refresh rate. Honestly, many 60-hertz displays can easily challenge the 8 Pro. I believe that the One Plus engineers are invaluable in this industry. It does have a new motion processor that is fun to use. This is different from the refresh rate. I appreciate it, and I'm not aware of any other phone that exists with that technology. I may be wrong. A few apps support this processing, such as Netflix, Prime and YouTube. It definitely sets itself apart from other devices on the market. Dolby Atmos audio speaker performance is great. I wish that manufacturers would revert back to front firing speakers. Thinking about those Pixel 2XL days. However, stereo separation is great from it's ear and downfiring speakers. Phone performance is great. I have no issues with calls or its 5G performance. I have to say that their Oxygen OS software is a step above stock Droid. Its Snapdragon chip is very good. Gaming is also good with very little video or audio lag. I Iike it's gaming processing. What I mean is it shuts down many other functions while it processes your choice of games. At times, it may get warm when gaming or watching videos. As with any other device, you can take proper steps to allow to cool, or not.Camera and video performance are good to excellent for those of you that appreciate camera capabilities. In my opinion, there aren't many devices on the market that are bad camera performers. Unless, you're a cameraphile, the average consumer will be just fine. If you've never owned a One Plus device, you will be pleasantly surprised with their performance. It's been fun. I highly recommend this device.","March 17, 2021"
864,OnePlus 8 Pro,Gregory S,1,"Let me start this by saying I love the form factor, and specs of this phone. I've owned many iPhones, Samsungs, LG, Google, etc. I was in love with this phone out of the box. Though the love quickly ended.This phone is plagued and I mean PLAGUED with issues as many others have noticed and commented on. Not only that but their customer support and clearly from the post on the forums their actual warranty service is horrid.For those still reading my boring rant here are my issues that I've encountered:1. Wifi Dropout issue. A quick search will show this is widespread. Android 11 fixed the dropout in some of my areas of my house. That said it made it worse in the areas that it didn't fix.2. Rattling vibration motor that is somehow fixed with a restart. This seems less common but is truly odd. The haptic motor that you feel every time you type will randomly get really really bad and feel super odd about once every couple of days and last until restart. Super odd3. Notifications that show up hours after they have been delivered. Never encountered on any other of my other androids4. SMS/MMS Group chats only work about sometimes. I've heard about this issue on other androids but have never experienced it personally. This phone simply refuses to deliver group chat text messages randomly.5. Display issues as others have mentioned at certain brightness levels6. (Subjective) Android 11s skin is not that great. It's clearly a rip off of Samsung. That was one of the reasons I left Samsung after the Note 10+. I just found their skin too cartoonish and their colors off. I personally find similar with this new skin.7. Battery life is horrid after android 118. Misc. small issues that don't warrant a section but are still annoying.Thanks for reading. I hope you got some form of enjoyment or info out of this. Don't buy the phone...","November 18, 2020"
865,OnePlus 8 Pro,Kit,5,"I have been using an HTC 10, so my experience is definitely different than many other users who upgrade every year or two.Pros:Screen resolution and refresh rate - nothing but compliments from users with standard refresh ratesBody color is stunningBattery life - usually I can make my phone last a day and a half of use (social media, reddit, and youtube...I don't do mobile gaming)Camera - the camera defaults to 12mp but the 48mp is amazing. Nowhere near DSLR quality because of the tiny sensor, but better than other phone cameras I have usedOS - Oxygen OS is by far the fastest and cleanest version of Android availableFace unlock - I forget my phone is ever locked because of how fast face unlock is.\NO BLOATWAREZoom to fit screen function is great with youtubeWeight. I like heftier phones as they feel sturdierSpeed - this phone is blazing fast with everything.Bluetooth - I can use my Bluetooth earbuds from the opposite side of the house and still have excellent quality. I can be outside in a rainstorm and keep my phone inside while staying on a call without issue.Cons:Price - They could have easily dropped the price to $900 for the highest end and been a market leader. But you definitely get what you pay forFingerprint sensor - for some reason it doesn't always recognize my finger. and I will try 2 or 3 different fingers until it'll unlock, but I primarily use face unlock or the swipe codeNeutral:Many people complain about the camera bump. Get a bumper case and you will never notice it. I personally don't mind it at allI don't mind the camera cutout at all. I downloaded ""Energy Ring General Edition"" and it uses the camera cut out to show the battery life (also has a cool charging animation called ""bounce"")Summary. This is well worth the $1000 and I have had zero glitches or green screen issues. Battery life is my main bonus. Will definitely be sticking with OnePlus going forward if this phone ever dies.","June 7, 2020"
866,OnePlus 8 Pro,Jim,4,"It's a little buggy since it's an off brand but the price is very nice compared to the $1000+ phones that do literally all the same things. My next phone will be OnePlus brand as well.Just make sure you have access to a computer cause like I said, this is buggy. Some apps won't work, even some websites malfunction. I have to restart phone every few days when it gets too buggy. Also the SMS is trash, can't do group texts and picture quality sent through SMS are always terrible.They also updated the alarm to some stupid pain in the butt scroll wheel as opposed to just pushing the numbers in and being done with it.Overall, I'm happy. Perfect for people like me who want to save money and have a practical product over paying for the brand name thing for whatever reason some people like to do.","January 19, 2024"
867,OnePlus 8 Pro,Amazon Customer,4,"I was in the market for a new phone as my OnePlus 6T was on its last leg, charging port no longer working, and the battery wasn't lasting as long as it use to.So far this phone has been great. It charges fast with my old OnePlus 30w Brick, the camera is great, storage is fantastic, wireless charging is awesome and I dont have to worry about wearing out the usb C port as fast. The menus, user interface, and overall build of the phone seem to be very solid so far.I havent experienced any of the green tint issues that were happening with this phone for other users last year and hoping that doesnt pop up at some point.My two gripes at the moment are cell signal and bluetooth. I work in a building with a metal roof pretty far from a cell tower but with my OnePLus 6T I never had less than 4 bars, calls were clear, and I never missed a call, text, etc.Since switching to the OnePlus 8 Pro my cell signal is significantly worse. No one can hear me while I'm inside the building anymore, sometimes I even wont receive calls until the last ring and by then the caller hangs up. I am using the same sim card as I was before on the same network as before. My APN is set correctly so it's definitely a phone issue.Bluetooth: While music will play through the car, earbuds, speakers no problem and at a decently loud volume, bluetooth calls however are terribly quiet. I never had any of these issues with my OnePlus 6T but in my vehicle I have to turn my phone and vehicles volumes to max to even barely hear the person on the other end, same with my bluetooth ear piece. Again music plays fine, audio calls do not. I have not found any changeable settings that allow me to correct his and it still is an issue at the moment. I have yet to find a third party app to bypass the bluetooth volume limit when on a call.","April 16, 2021"
868,OnePlus 8 Pro,Mark,4,"This is my first Oneplus phone, I opted for the non-pro version because of the slightly smaller screen, and the fact that the hardware specs I care about were identical on both (90hz is more than enough for me, and going from 60hz to 90hz is much more important than 90hz to 120hz). It's definitely fast and powerful, and in terms of running apps smoothy, is as good as any flagship Samsung or iPhone right now.The main con for me is that there's no external storage options, which is the one thing I miss the most from the S10e I replaced this with. The 256GB version certainly comes with enough storage, but I definitely miss the convenience of being able to pop the card out from one phone and put it in the other and keep all my music and pictures on it without having to sync to anything.My other main issue has to do with the OS. There's a volume slider on the side, which is fine, but you can't actually put the phone on vibrate or silent in the software itself, which really sucks since most of the cases for this phone so far require you to dig your finger in there and basically claw at your phone to silence it.My other gripes are more with the industry as a whole right now which this phone copied, so they are problems with pretty much any good phone right now. Curved screens might look cool but they are actually a spectacular pain to use, especially if you are using apps that require touches at the very edges of the screen, not to mention putting screen protectors on them is also a huge pain. Also I'm a guy with big hands and I can barely use this thing one handed, most apps don't even support the ridiculously long 6.5 inch screen anyway, so it's not like things even look better on it. This might be mitigated if the OS offered a good one handed mode options, but you are stuck with whatever is on the play store if you want to attempt that with this OS.I like the phone enough that I'll definitely consider Oneplus phones in another couple of years when I might upgrade again though (I like it overall better than Samsung that I have my own gripes with), I just hope OP offers a version with a smaller, flat screen, and adds external storage options, and it would be almost a completely perfect phone.","May 10, 2020"
869,OnePlus 8 Pro,Dylan Whisnant,4,"..... With no future supported Android updates it just makes the phone lose all its luster for me personally.  Great screen and controls , love the mute/ring/vibrate switch.  Fast performance.","March 3, 2024"
870,OnePlus 8 Pro,rEsearcher,4,"I have to say that at first I was very happy with this phone. Until I found out that the 5MP color filter camera lens is just a placebo. There is a feature that we all pay for as part of this $900 (plus) price tag that we are not getting.One feature, and the only feature that uses this lens is the Photochrom feature. I have come to find that after some public complaints about this photo feature they have disabled it and now the camera lens is just sitting there having no purpose and we are paying for this hardware in the cost of the phone.I certainly will be searching for others that are complaining about this and join in with them in whatever solutions they have come up with. But it is in my best interest to not pay for things I do not receive.I'm sure this feature has an added cost of possibly hundreds of dollars and if we are being denied the use of it we should be compensated by OnePlus for having removed it. They should refund us for the feature and they should reduce the ongoing cost of the phone accordingly.In fact they are still advertising the feature even though it doesn't exist on their web page. In the specifications for this phone it states a 5MP color filter camera lens. It doesn't state a 5MP unused camera lens. It is supposed to be present specifically for the Photochrom photo filter feature that is no longer present.There are other quirks that I can mention about this phone but compared to being charged for things I cannot use is bad enough.Amazon has been very good about everything though. They have been very helpful. The first one I received had an issue where there was no response to touch on the screen and they promptly replaced it for me. Great job Amazon. Thanks.","June 21, 2020"
871,OnePlus 8 Pro,Bma4506,4,"Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone. Your mileage may vary in that opinion, but I figured I should update this review","May 12, 2020"
872,OnePlus 8 Pro,Lyndon,5,I originally got this phone in June and I wanted to use it or over a month to generate honest opinions. First off Alexa is not pre-installed you have to manually install it. Secondly the Amazon OnePlus 8 does not come with a clear case included in the box. Now that I got those out of the way this phone is amazing it's really fast has an amazing screen though some people say they have green tint issues I have not experienced that on my unit. The software or oxygen OS is very fast and very reminiscent of stock Android though there are some pre-installed apps such as Netflix and Facebook installer but you are able to uninstall Facebook. The screen is beautiful and pretty big and that 90 Hz makes a huge difference from 60 Hz. I showed this to my friends and family and they were blown away with how fast it was. The camera on this phone gets a bad rap from people for some unknown reason because I've used this and it's the best camera of ever used on a phone apart from the 2mp macro camera that is only useful for gimmicky purposes. I actually had a better experience with the main camera zoomed in two times than the macro camera. Battery life on this phone with my usage is amazing I watch a lot of YouTube and scroll through social media every once in awhile and play simple games and I get a day and a half to two days of battery life. Even if the battery life wasn't amazing the warp charge 30t charges my phone from 0% to 70% in 30 minutes. The downsides of this phone are losing out on some flagship creature comforts such as wireless charging an official IP rating and a telephoto camera. Honestly this phone in a $699 package is a great value it includes all of the flagship features you need and cuts the stuff you don't. I bragged about this phone constantly and convinced my family members to switch from their iPhones to this phone.,"August 27, 2020"
873,OnePlus 8 Pro,Robb,5,"This phone is hands down the best smartphone of 2020. The One Plus version of Android is a superior experience compared to Samsung. It is less convoluted and more streamlined in various ways. You simply have to experience it first hand as it is hard to convey in words. Every aspect of this phone can be summed up as ""fast"". The feel of the phone in your hand is a very dense, premium feel that neither an iPhone or Galaxy phone can come close to matching with very intuitive button placement. The One Plus 8 Pro makes every other phone feel cheap in comparison. The screen will attract attention from everyone as nothing else on the market can run a screen at 1440p resolution with a 120mhz refresh rate enabled - not even $1,400 dollar phones. The colors have to be seen to be believed. This is a next generation screen that everyone has to catch up to next year. The camera photos are every bit as beautiful as the high end Galaxies and Apple phones. You will not feel cheated in this area. Plus, it performs up close Macro shots that show a level of detail on objects unlike anything to date. One Plus delivers Android updates months ahead of the competition. There simply aren't any weak areas. This isn't a phone with downsides. I can't believe this phone exceeded my expectations in all areas but it did. I have no problem giving it this level of praise. This is beyond a solid device - it raises the bar. My friends who own S20 Ultra phones and Pro Max Apple phones are impressed and do not hesitate to say so. This phone would sell itself if there were demo units in physical retail stores. Nothing else can challenge it. Do not over think this and buy this phone for yourself and your loved ones. You will feel like a whole new world has opened up to you. I can't go back to any other phone manufacturer after experiencing such a smooth, intelligently designed product!","August 24, 2020"
874,OnePlus 8 Pro,Robb,2,"The overall phone itself is a good phone, especially for the price. That said, it has some glaring issues that shoot it in the foot, and I can't recommend it to basically anyone, especially not at $900.Pros:- Amazing battery life. Probably the best of any of the ""standard"" flagships.- Beautiful screen. The colors are great (outside of some small issues I'll mention below), it's crisp, and the 120hz is really nice.- Standard flagship specs, with a top end SoC, more RAM than a phone should ever really need, and a ton of storage.- Cheap for a flagship. Even though it's $900, it undercuts most of the competition. It's more expensive than older models, but it's got good specs on paper.- Good front camera position. The back one is a bit weird with how long it is, but the front punchout camera on the front is positioned very nicely. Unlike some of Samsung's models that have it right smack in the middle, OnePlus chose to put it to the side, and I personally think that's a great design decision.Cons:- The screen does have a bit of the tinting issues you might notice (frequently mentioned in reviews), but it's easy to adjust to and only really affects lower brightness settings.- Curved screen. I've never liked these a whole lot, and the One Plus is super sharply curved. Less a con and more a preference, but I leave it here because I disliked it.- The deal breaker: the glass. I'm inclined to believe I may have gotten a bad model, but I did a quick search and there's been at least a handful of other people who have had the issue. The phone uses Gorilla Glass 5 on the front, the same that most phones have for years. Every time GG ups a number, it's usually a little less scratch resistant but more shatter proof. However, this is the same as my previous phone, the Pixel 3XL. That phone is over two years old and has no scratches on it. I haven't been the nicest with it either; it's been slid along rough wood, dropped in dirt, stepped on at least once by accident, clawed by pets. And there is 0 scratching. I removed the screen protector on the OnePlus because I'm pretty careful; most of those were occasional accidents and I figured it would be fine, because I don't like the screen protector texture. Within a week of having the OnePlus 8, I started seeing scratching along the curve of the screen. Within 3 weeks, it had half a dozen small but pretty deep scratches and one very big one. I had the same case that I had on the Pixel (Spiggen's Tough Armor), and the glass on the Pixel had definitely seen it's share of use and ""scratching"" in terms of contact. It's the same glass, supposedly, and yet one was getting trashed in a fraction of the time. I can't say if it was a flawed model or what, but things that aren't harder than glass shoudlnt scratch it, and the Pixel had seen a *lot* more abuse than the OnePlus which I was babying. I hadn't dropped it at all, I only set it facedown maybe three times total, it was always alone in my pocket when it was there. I'm tempted to believe it was defective but I don't know. Either way, I've returned the phone but I thought I should share my experience.","October 15, 2020"
875,OnePlus 8 Pro,Hayden,5,"Wow, pros: Everything.  Super fast, long battery life, great pure android experience (no bloat wear), sound is fantastic, screen is fantastic.  I'm not a huge picture taker, but it all looks great to me in zoom or low light - things that other phones usually don't get right at all.  Love the vivid colors options and the finger print reader is best I've used.  It captures the whole finger print, so you can touch it off axis with no problems.  I compared to a 8t+ (my sons) and I did notice a difference in battery life and speed from the DDR5 vs. DDR4 memory.  Other than that both phones are about identical in RAM/ROM, etc.  Also, it does inductance charging which I love.  I keep a charge stand on my bedside table and desk.  Battery life is exceptional.  You really can charge it up and use it off and on throughout the day to call, email, stream, and surf the web on a single charge.  It is water resistant rated vs. just actually being water resistant but not rated, which I like and trust more.  Wifi hookup is very fast and 5G is insane.  Easily 500+mbs on T-Mobile all over town.  I have had it fall back to 4G LTE in some places like steel framed buildings.Cons:  Honesty, none so far.  I do like the standard back/home/open apps task bar vs gestures (default) but found it in settings ad switched it and that fixed that.  Gestures work as advertised but I just can't get used to them, especially the back gesture.Overall, I cant rave enough about this phone.  Especially if you get it used or renewed and save big bucks.Highly recommend.","February 28, 2021"
876,OnePlus 8 Pro,Hayden,3,"I upgraded from a OnePlus 7 pro. I gotta say this phone is so lovely to use. It's hundreds less than s20+ and yet it is much better in my opinion. Cleaner ui close to stock Android with neat customizations. The display color accuracy is superb, I love how I can enable qhd and 120hz all while getting a good battery life with brightness at 75%. I use the phone daily throughout the day to web browse, watch YouTube, text, stream from Netflix Hulu etc, music with bluetooth, wifi mostly on all day and it's solid.Next the build is very excellent and that's how it should be for 1000 dollars.The cameras, the main sensor is super crisp, the wide angle is also quite sharp, and same goes for telephoto, the macro photography is actually super insane in this phone. It focuses so quickly across all cameras, the colors are super vivid and bright with nice contrast and I love how I can get insanely close to a subject and it still focuses without issues at all. Now I never really used much of the 30x zoom but it seems good and it can be useful to see things from far away. The selfie camera is good but I don't really care for the face smoothing. The overall camera quality is so good like for sure flagship level.The face unlock, fingerprint scanner are super quick and reliable. Works all the time. All the amazing features listed are so sick and work all the time! This phone is a beast. It's a phone that just works so I don't feel like I need to say much more.Now the only issue with this phone is the display. After just a day of use I started seeing image retention and burn in and it gradually got more noticeable as the weeks went on. At very low brightness there is a black bar/line that runs across from home punch camera but I don't really mind that because it's only visible from 0- like 30% ish brightness. It's the image retention that worries me for long term use. I personally have tried two units one from Amazon and OnePlus directly and both had the same issues. I didn't want to take the risk so I returned. I wouldn't recommend this phone with that display issue but if your unit is good then that's awesome.","August 31, 2020"
877,OnePlus 8 Pro,Catfanatic3000,4,"Great smartphone. Super fast. I don't even need to speed up Animations in the Developer Options. Excellent battery. Great dual speakers. I do miss the headphone jack but I had a dongle (USB C → 3.5 headphone jack). It's my first time using Oxygen OS and although it's not as refined as One UI 2.0 (Samsung's skin), maybe that's why it's so snappy. The microphone is also not as great as my S10e but does the job. The camera is fine.About 5G capabilities. With AT&T, 5G works on my iPhone 12 mini bought UNLOCKED but WILL NOT WORK ON OP8 with AT&T.OnePlus is great. Nice and light. I don't favor curved screens (I realized and have enjoyed S10e, Note 20, 12 Mini) since hands are not large. Also why I prefer 12 mini or Note 20 (where Samsung One UI allows for resizing apps simply by pulling from top corner, whereas vanilla android OS, not my flavor, realized).But OnePlus ""skin"" called Oxygen OS is wonderful! If you're a true android fan and enjoy warp charge, slider (like on iPhone) for sound off/onno headphone jack, no wireless charge, quickest Android OS updates, Oxygen OS features like gestures on screen-off, then this is the phone for you.Volume keys on the left side and then the slider and power button on the right side.[On the off-chance you're wondering- iPhone 12, volume and silent toggle on the left, and power button on the right.And for the Note 20 5G, annoyingly, nothing on left side and volume and power on the right side. ]","July 5, 2020"

879,OnePlus 8 Pro,Dylan Whisnant,5,"I came from a galaxy s7 to oneplus 8.  What a world of difference.  I know I was using a 4 year old phone, but wow, this thing is so much faster.  Literally everything I do happens in a fraction of the time my old dinosaur s7 took.  The 90hz display is awesome, and smooth as butter.  Thank you oneplus for not dumping a dozen useless trash apps into the phone like other companies do...cough..samsung...cough.  Not buying from the carrier saved me another dozen useless apps..cough..tmobile...cough.  The UI is great, coming from garbage touchwiz.  I feel like I finally have a good phone.  It has a minor issue that oneplus could improve upon.  I miss having an always on display.  The oneplus 8 has kind of a half-azzed version of that.  The display will light up for notifications, but only the instant you get them, then the screen returns to darkness.  That is nearly useless since I'm not staring at my phone constantly.  There's also no indicator light to let you know you've gotten notifications.  So basically when you get a notification of any kind, the phone's half on display flashes for about 5 seconds, then goes dark.  You can't tell if you got a notification or not until you either tap the display or pick the phone up(if you have those settings configured).  This really should have been an always on display, and probably still could be if oneplus just changes when it's active.  The battery lasts a long time, more than a day for me.  I'd gladly trade a few % of that to have the always on display.  It charges very fast with warp charge.  I've had no problems with any of the phone's hardware or software.  Overall, great fast phone.","July 1, 2020"
880,OnePlus 8 Pro,Nick,5,"Pros:-Screen is beautiful, a slightly bigger resolution from the previous generation of phones.  Do I really need to say the 120Hz is absolutely stunning?!-Speakers are LOUD, honestly did not expect the level they produce, they are by no means audiophile but they do a good job.-Responsiveness to touch is next level, I've used Apple's and Samsung's flagships, and I really enjoy the  smoothness of transitions between applications, faster than the competitors I have tried.-Oxygen OS is by far one of my favorites of the phone, it's lightweight and not bogged down by anything.-Games run very smooth!-Battery life is pretty amazing, 4500mah last a LONG timeCons-Some people may be turned off that by default Netflix comes installed on the phone(Though the HDR on it is AMAZING LOOKING)-Transitioning from an Apple or Samsung may leave some software features to desire, possibly UI issues you do not like.  However there is a great deal of customization with this phone so it has never been an issue with me.ALEXA-Alexa DOES NOT COME INSTALLED BY DEFAULT, PLEASE STOP DOWN VOTING FOR A PHONE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE.-That being said if you want alexa, it's in the app store, if not you're set!Conclusion-This phone was controversial in a that it was a flagship, from a company that has historically against flagships.  However, it is an absolutely superb piece of technology that is well worth the money.","May 13, 2020"
881,OnePlus 8 Pro,Nick,4,"This is mostly a review on either Amazon or OnePlus fulfillment abilities at the moment.I put in an order for an Ultramarine Blue 8 Pro two weeks ago, only for my order to get delayed. And to put salt on the wound, I finally got the package today, only to reveal a standard 8 in Interstellar Glow. Not sure who screwed up here, but I'm just letting anyone interested know that getting theses phones in your hands is a process right now.Will update once I finally get the correct device.Update:Received the correct phone within the same week. Amazon guarantees that you will receive the correct item within 3-5 business days of receiving the returned item, which seems to happen even if it's out of stock. They must have some in reserve just in case. Say what you will about Amazon, but their customer service is top notch.If you're deciding between ordering off of OnePlus's website vs Amazon, definitely go Amazon for their service and accountability. Stock still seems to be an issue, so if you're willing to wait a month or so for that to steady, I'm sure you will encounter a much smoother experience than I did.The phone itself absolutely flies, and the ultramarine is straight up gorgeous. Quite an upgrade from my chugging Galaxy S8. However, no phone is worth the $400+ price premium gougers are charging when out of stock; the wait will be worth it.Overall, I'd rate everything a 3.5, but Amazon doesn't do half stars.","May 11, 2020"
882,OnePlus 8 Pro,James B,5,"Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already.","June 21, 2020"
883,OnePlus 8 Pro,Grayson Brane,4,"Phone is great with minor issues. Specs are the best out there and OnePlus consistently releases updates no less than monthly to make the experience better. Oh and Alexa does not come preinstalled on the phone. And no I don't have any green tint issues.Pros:- Phone is fast. No lag.- Screen is beautiful ❤️- Oxygen OS is nice. Some say new OS11 looks too much like Samsung One UI and doesn't have stock Android feel anymore. I like OS11.- Good battery life- 5G, VoLTE, WiFi Calling works well (on Google Fi)- Good speaker- Phone exterior is beautiful. The 🔵 is unique.Cons:- Camera is hit or miss. Some pictures are crystal clear. Others are blurry. Not sure if it's device or user error. My Pixel 3XL (previous phone) takes better photos.- Using phone outdoors during summer in 100+ degree weather caused overheating notifications and usage was limited. I don't recall having this issue with other devices. This was problematic for me because it was 100+ degrees almost every day in the summer. So if you live in a hot area and find yourself outdoors for a long period of time, be aware.Overall, I am happy with the phone. Hopefully future updates continue to improve the camera.","December 11, 2020"
884,OnePlus 8 Pro,Jimbotron,5,I had an One Plus 8 phone that was two years old but recently had a bloated battery and I needed a phone to use while I am waiting for the time to get the battery replaced on the One Plus 8 that I had.  This phone is quite a nice upgrade in speed and storage over the One Plus 8.  I love the color.  I also got this at a price that was nearly $300 off the regular price which made it easy to select this.  I've read the 9 and 10 models aren't as good as the 8 and I was not going to pay full price for a newer phone.  This will work until I see the 11th generation is worth purchasing at a discounted rate.  Very pleased with the phone and speed.,"July 22, 2023"
885,OnePlus 8 Pro,wardawgmalvicious,4,"It is possible the 5g factor has improved my cell service. We have a remote property and my previous phone could not capture the internet and could not even make calls but the One Plus 8 Pro overcame this obstacle. The service out there is not perfect but I can make calls, download files, etc. Sometime there is lag. No problems in urban areas except that on occasion there is some lag in the scroll feature but this is not a huge annoyance to me, maybe for others, (after all, it is a thousand dollar device)! Color is great and I am still checking out the camera as I am only into week two with this phone. Lucky for me, I am not a fan of fingerprint readers but I gave it a try and encountered multiple failures, so I gave up on that. After giving up, I opted for a screen protector called ""glass helmet"" and I highly recommend this for a phone like the One Plus that has a curved edge. The protector is applied as a liquid and covers the phone perfectly, for a measly 20 bucks. I read tons of reviews and research before choosing the One Plus 8 Pro and I still think it is one of the very best of what is out there at this moment in marketing time.","July 30, 2020"
886,OnePlus 8 Pro,Renee,5,"I use Consumer Cellular, which is on the AT&T network. This phone is certified by AT&T in US so it worked out of the box when I inserted my SIM card (it sets the APN automatically). It uses VoLTE but not VoWiFi (I think AT&T doesn't support it). It gets 5G in Dallas, Texas but the connection is sporadic. For AT&T 5G, it uses the n5 band but none of the mmWave bands (n260 and n261), which are for very high speeds. My Xiaomi 11 phone that uses the same AT&T 5G band connects to 5G in more areas in Dallas. Compared to OnePlus 8 Pro, it has less storage, no wireless charging, and no 120Hz display, which are not important to me. Surprisingly, the fingerprint reader, which is on screen, works very well. It took 1 hour to charge the battery from 1% to 100% using the 30W charger. It has a great display (curved at the edges which I thought was nice), fast response, light, not bloated with apps. The only thing I didn't like was the lack of audio jack, but this is common now.","March 18, 2022"
887,OnePlus 8 Pro,Carroll Prescott,5,"Best festures:  Scrolling is liquid smooth.  Warp charging (1+ shipped wireless chargers air express from CN with free shipping).  Apps load FAST.  Handles huge pdfs like a Threadripper (well... almost).  Awesome dpi.  Screen looks as good as AMOLED.  Battery life with 120Hz QHD+ display on.  VOWIFI works on Google Fi... although the VOWIFI toggle doesn't appear in the SIM settings with a Fi SIM installed (the VOWIFI toggle does appear with a TMo SIM installed), VOWIFI does work on Fi after following a magic sequence that Fi support will send you (even though you won't see a VOWIFI icon in the notification bar).Worst features:  Can't get fingerprint recognition to work... not a biggie since I've never seen fingerprint recognition work with wet fingers on any phone, so you revert to a PIN code anyway..  Cameras have excellent sensors (Sony) but image processing is not as good as Pixel.I've had every Nexus and Pixel phone, but I returned a Pixel 5 and kept the 8P.UPDATE, after a month of ownership.  No regrets, no problems.  As of the OxygenOS 11 update in Nov. 2020, dual SIM works (5G/5G !!!) with Google Fi, but second SIM cannot be a Fi SIM.  I'm using a Fi SIM and an AT&T (prepaid) SIM in my 8P (some places in my state (Hawaii) TMo has no bars and AT&T has 4 bars).","December 16, 2020"
888,OnePlus 8 Pro,Mark,4,"I got this phone and tried to copy all my stuff from the old phone. It took several attempts to finally be able to copy some of it.One unpleasant surprise - it does not have a notification light for new messages (e-mail, sms, wapp) and missed calls. I tried the so called ""horizon light"" which is useless - it only blinks once when you get a message and then stops. It would be helpful if it blinks or stays on continuously until you check the messages. The lack of a basic visual notification is unexcusable.Second surprise: it comes with some preinstalled junk you cannot get rid of - Netflix, Youtube etc.The battery holds OK for days. It lasted over 4 days while using the bluetooth for speaker and headphones, whapp talk/messaging, e-mail (no gaming or video streaming). It charges fast (41% to 93% in 30 mins) albeit a bit slower than advertised.All in all, the phone is OK for the price of $392.","October 17, 2021"
889,OnePlus 8 Pro,Dylan Whisnant,3,"This is the first ""unlocked"" phone I've ever bought. I took the phone to Verizon to have them activate it etc. It was not near as smooth a process as I had hoped it would be. I've had the phone about a month now and my only real complaints in the beginning was the process of getting it activated and the built in alexa funtionality and the built in Alexa functionality was VERY important to me and the ONLY reason I bought an unlocked phone rather than getting one directly from my cell provider. However, here recently I've also been having issues where the on screen keyboard does not go away when its suppose to.Built in Alexa functionality:  It rarely triggers via the keyword the first time I say it. It usually takes 2-3 times. When it does trigger I get the message ""cannot connect to network"" a lot when at home and the phone is usually only 6 feet or so from my router and i have the Netgear Nighthawk AX8 AX6000 router and do not notice any network issues with any of my other devices.I don't know if the Alexa issues are phone related or Amazon related and I've never had an Alexa built in phone before to compare my experience too. For anyone that's had an Alexa built in phone I would love to know how your experience has been with it.At this point I'm strongly thinking about returning the phone as when i get new things my expectation is that everything works as it's suppose to work.I will say one thing i do really like about the phone is the display. It has the whitest white I've ever seen on any display (computer or phone).","August 6, 2020"
890,OnePlus 8 Pro,Din Carpati,5,"This is the OnePlus 8 pro with the 128GB storage accounting for the lower price. To me it isn't worth the extra money for more storage. To someone else it might be with the money for that upgrade. This is my 4th OnePlus device. Definitely the best. Right off I'm impressed with the 5G signal I get from the T-Mobile network. With just a bar or 2 signal strength it's like full strength 4G. No problem at all sending or receiving pictures with that weak signal.The other thing to mention is how much fun the camera is to play with (if you have time). I've taken a few hours one day to go through different features: slow-mo, time lapse, color filter, panarama, 48 megapixel, and 12 megapixel. If you don't have time to play with settings in camera it will still simply take a great shot.The bigger battery is nice. A normal day for me at work would be that I listen to music on Bluetooth headphones for about 6 hours, normal check or send a few messages, gander through news headlines at lunch and still have over 60% battery at the end of day.The software from OnePlus is really good because it allows you to set different things for your own taste. Not just a wall paper or icons but themes, ringtones (your own from external storage), vibrations, to name a few.This is basically my highlight real for this device.","June 15, 2020"
891,OnePlus 8 Pro,Ryan G,5,"OnePlus are the best option if you won't want to shell of too much money on Samsung.Or if you don't want to shell money on unproven Google Pixel series.Reason why I bought this phone? I had a OnePlus 6T and I had zero complains on it. But I was enticed in trying the true stock Android experience and after 1 year of use, I switched to Pixel 4XL. God what a mistake that was. After 3 warranty replacements, I couldn't wait for trading in that phone to buy OnePlus 8T. Traded in with Amazon and then I had to decide between OnePlus 8 Pro and OnePlus 8T. One has the flat screen as advantage. Other has the excellent camera. I chose the Camera over flat screen.Other than surviving the edge, I'm 100% happy with this phone. Hopefully, I want to updated to OnePlus 9 Pro if it doesn't have an edge. After all, I'm an every year buyer.PS: Do not buy this phone if you cannot see a phone in-person which has curved edges. Walk in to T Mobile or Costco some where wee you can see any phone which has curved edges, experience it and then decide to buy. Else you may end up hating the purchase. Also remember, finding a tempered glass protector is next to impossible.","December 5, 2020"
892,OnePlus 8 Pro,DB,3,"Tons of money, so I have high expectations. It's been three months of ownership.Negatives:Two months after ownership the company disabled one of the four cameras (the near-IR camera) with an OTA update. This camera was pretty cool and I had fun with it, got some cool shots. Extremely unimpressed that they can legally remove a hardware feature from my phone without telling me and not refunding me some of the $1000 price tag.The screen glass is very fragile. I'm bummed after all these years Gorilla Glass hasn't improved at all. Screen protectors on the curved screen are awful and I had remoced a crappy one for a week before my new one came in. Permanent almost chip like scratch, didn't drop it or anything.Dual SIM is still not supported after all this time, despite being promised. For a while I had bad cell service, but that was fixed in an update.Inscreen fingerprint is still unimpressive compared to old normal fingerprint sensors. Slower and less consistant, but usable.Positives:The 48MP camera is AMAZING. Just pure bliss to use. 4K60 videos are smooth, and stills are gorgeous. Great color and detail. Wish I could make 48MP the default, unimpressed with the 12MP mode.Screen is beautiful, bright, and smooth. Wish they were flat edges instead of curved. Some color inconsistancies on greys with low backlight.Battery life and charging options are great. Warp is fast, QuickCharge is very convienent, wireless charging is nice. I always use full resolution and 120Hz.Performance is excellent.Overall should last me a long time and overall pleased. Just wish all the stuff worked correctly.","August 9, 2020"

The phone brought everything you need to get yourself started. You can use google to transfer data or oneplus switch app. It was super simple to migrate. I love the color and finish of this blue model. It isnt a finger print magnet. I do not have a green tint> I did have an upgrade to install shortly after getting set up. Not sure if it fixes that issue but i didnt notice it. The in display finger print sensor and face unlock are super snappy. So far I couldn't be happier, I will update after a few weeks.What i got in the box-phone-charger-charging cable-clear phone case2x screen protectors( not the best, the glue holds well around the edges, I got 2 bubbles in mine my fault during install.Im using google assistant not alexa, You can use either or. Its a little weird switching from Samsung one UI to Oneplus Oxygen OS( both android) but i do like how quick this OS feels to the One UI, will take a few days to get used toCons- I wish the charging cable was longer,  Camera bump is a bit bulky compared to my note 8.","May 11, 2020"
894,OnePlus 8 Pro,Tejasvi,3,"My iPhoneX died a few days ago due to water damage (I was sanitizing it). I've heard so many positive things about this phone and this company on Youtube. It has this great display, great camera, great battery and the best android OS. I am having issues with all of them!In almost every app, whenever I touched the scream, it would constantly count as a press even if I am just scrolling. Camera is good but cannot compete with the iPhone 11 pro. Battery is decent. With normal usage without playing game, it could last more than a day. If I unplug the charger before sleep, it would drain 10% battery over night. I think my iPhone drops less than 10% over night. An iPhone could achieve this battery life with smaller battery. The OxygenOS is okay but not perfect. I constantly have difficulty with the wifi. It would connect, then disconnect, and use my LTE. Or just drop the wifi completely while the circular is off. If I reconnect, it would sometime still drop off automatically. I tried this with another modem, same issue. The last thing I want to say is the fingerprint scanner. I understand that it requires a strong bright light for this to work under the screen. However, it is very disturbing at night or using this phone in a car at night. It would make you blind for a second. I mean if this phone is priced at $599 or $499, I would be okay with this phone. The iPhone 11 256GB starts at $849.Pros: Charing is fast. (I guess iPhone with QC2.0 could achieve similar but slower charing speed)Cons: Everything above.","August 4, 2020"

I had the 7 Pro- nothing wrong with it yet with T-Mobile's inferior 4G network I couldn't reliably connect in a kitty of places.After seeing their extensive 5G network (and loving my $60 monthly for two lines) I wanted to see how I could improve my T-Mobile experience.What a difference (especially after getting a new sim card)! The coverage is outstanding and this phone rocks! The speeds are ridiculously fast and this phone checks all the boxes:- Wireless charging- 120 MHz scrolling- High water resistance rating- Superior battery life- Wireless charge other devices- Great sounding speakers- Larger battery- Warp charger included (and still Warp charges with my 2019 OnePlus Warp car charger)- Ability to clone certain apps (Want to have two Facebook accounts on your phone? Done!)- Excellent photos- Unlocked and always timely Android updates from OnePlusThere is so much more- all at a price which is hundreds less than flagship Samsung and iPhone phones.I've been a fan since buying my OnePlus 3T...

Despite the advertisement of Alexa being baked in , it is optional in my experience, as it did not come preinstalled, so for those concerned or interested, that's how my scenario played out.Light user so on the battery, it took about until 7pm for the battery to get to 50% , I know average screen time is listed as 8-9 hours though. This is on 120hz fhd as well.Camera is great. Love the super macro function and the night time camera. Coming from a OP3T, so any upgrade is a welcome one. My roommate had a S10+ and this phone seems to pummel the image quality.Charges from 50-100 in about 20~ minutes. Beautiful finish on the phone, keep in mind comes with two screen protectors, they didn't seem too sturdy so I'm planning on getting some tempered ones when they're available. The screen in itself is absolutely gorgeous.Downsides so far, screen edges are kind of difficult to navigate and the in display fingerprint reader feels like a step down from my 3T, definitely not as snappy, maybe I need to reconfigure my fingerprint, but there are times it can't read my print.I will update upon further use!","May 15, 2020"

I was not familiar with One Plus at all.Now I am a couple weeks in. I am very happy with it. The most striking difference for me was the display. It is beautiful. The phone is also very snappy with apps. Which is one thing which I wasn't sure I would notice. I don't consider myself a heavy phone user during the day. Especially working from home, there is always a computer in front of me. However, even on days where I spend more time on the phone, the battery seems to last until bedtime.

903,OnePlus 8 Pro,Kenneth Barnes,5,"It's my first day with the one plus 8 pro 256GB phone, coming from galaxy s9+ (2years ago). This phone is clearly faster, but the best part is the smooth scrolling. Screen looks good, and I tend to trust displaymate. The finger print reader is instant so far. I noticed the sound of this phone has better base than s9 plus, voice of YouTuber sounded better on speaker. As a Samsung lover, I've been wondering what features I may miss. So far just occasionally checking on Samsung what time I fell asleep. For a moment, I recall thinking, Atmos, I doubt one plus covered that base. But they did.The gs9 + is lighter, and a bit shorter, and I can tell it feels better when limited to one hand. The galaxy s20+, my other consideration, is even lighter than the s9 plus. I think this is the main disadvantage to me, but so far I'm excited to give a new oem a chance. I think one plus checked so many boxes it was a compelling choice.

A lot of people say this phone is terrible but I just don't see it. Lots of bang for your buck here. Great audio too which is a big upgrade from the 6.4 stars because of the curved edges which results in plastic protector bubbling and not sitting correctly.","November 21, 2021"
906,OnePlus 8 Pro,userMQ7RGL1,5,"So far this phone has been the best phone I have ever used to date. My last phone was a Pixel 2, which I had no real complaints about except it was getting old. Oneplus 8 Pro is definitely noticeable bigger than the Pixel 2 and the screen is also brighter and better. The in-display fingerprint scanner is pretty cool just have to make sure you put a screen protector on that doesn't mess it up. The phone is very fast and by far has the best battery life of any phone that I have used so far. Can almost get through 2 days with my regular use, also charging is very fast with the 30 watt charging. The only thing I don't like is the aggressive waterfall screen that goes down the sides, you will definitely have some unwanted screen touches, happens to me all the time while watching videos. But all in all, this is a great phone that does everything well and is a little cheaper than the flagships of Samsung and Apple.

The new infrared camera filter that was called the x-ray filter, that had been deactivated in an upgrade over the summer. While they said they restored this to American models, mine never came back.Then I decided to switch to Google Fi service and found that the One Plus 6 and 7 are both comparable with Fi, but no longer is the 8 Pro or the 8T.i called customer support and was on the phone with a a person for an hour as she also was surprised at what I was telling her because she was not aware of this update also screwing up that as well either. Then there was the day when I was in the middle of downtown LA which is 80 miles from where I live and I was having constant issues with the device. This totally could have been a carrier issue although since my car broke down and I have an injured foot currently, it was not a pleasant experience. I had to have a stranger call my friend to come get me since payphones don't exist any more.Thankfully I realized that I had until the end of January to return it. Google Fi gave me a decent deal on the S20 Ultra Samsung and I chucked my carrier and sent back the phone. Maybe the 9 will wow everyone. The 8 sucks, not much good I can say about it.","February 21, 2021"
908,OnePlus 8 Pro,Mark,5,"I came from a Galaxy Note 10+ and before that Note 9. This phone has superior hardware and software. I had it for about a month and had zero issues. I do wish it had a stylus like the Note series but its a small sacrifice for a superb product with a very affordable price tag. The phone has a lot of support for customization on XDA Developers website. Even after customizing the software and adding extra features I get roughly 23 hours of battery life (normal to heavy use). In comparison, my Note 9 and 10+ lasted about 15 - 20 hours with similar use. The camera system is great, especially the Macro feature. The phone came with minimal bloatware (which was swiftly removed) and works smoothly as though I just got it today. The phone it works great on T-Mobile and At&T (two I tested). Internet speed on 5G is mind-blowing (over 150 Mbps in locations with strong signal). I just wish the OnePlus 8 Pro 2025 version with 256 GB Rom and 12 GB Ram came in green. I highly recommend!","October 4, 2020"
909,OnePlus 8 Pro,Dylan Whisnant,5,"This is an awesome phone at a great price. The screen quality is excellent and the few photos I've taken are great!Would definitely recommend this phone to anyone looking for a great flagship phone that's not as expensive as other brands like Apple or Samsung. My partner has a Samsung S20+ and I can honestly say, the OnePlus 8 Pro can easily hold a candle next to it. I actually prefer the camera punch hole in the corner as apposed to the Samsung's centered one in the screen.Scrolling is super smooth and the included video showing off the Dolby Atmos makes me really love this phone.The screen had a screen protector on, which I didn't expect, but appreciate.My only qualms is that the box my phone arrived in from Amazon wasn't packed well and I'm just glad the phone survived the trip. It could move around in the box that Amazon packed it into, which is not ideal for something that is expensive and sensitive to bumps.","December 18, 2020"
910,OnePlus 8 Pro,eren gg,4,"Incredible phone, but One's Plus's customer service and software has big flaws. So, let's start off with the fact that this is the nicest Android phone I've ever owned and I always have the nicest ones.Now the cons: One Plus's customer service is terrible and unfair. Also, the phone has a really dumb feature where when if press the power and volume button accidentally (can easily happen when you are gripping the phone) or when trying to restart the phone, it puts the phone in vibrate mode. One cannot disable this option anywhere! Futhermore, the status bar doesn't even show that it is in vibrate mode. A Oneplus forum thread has been talking about this issue since the OnePlus 7 or earlier and they still haven't fixed the problem!! So much for listening to their customers! Ha. Other than the two big flaws mentioned, the phone is a work of art.","June 24, 2020"
911,OnePlus 8 Pro,Christo,4,"Theres a lot to say on this phone. Hardware: Top knotch, Nothing short of Great price. Doesnt feel cheap and definitely an attention grabber (Oh is that the new iphone 🤦‍♀️)  Camera quality is Great, Speaker is great, Slippery but it comes with a case. Comes with preinstalled screen protector.. As far as software thats where I start to question this phones capabilities. 12 gb ram seems exaggerated as I would only have 5 apps open and my connection becomes unresponsive, Clearing app backgrounds does help but dont feel it should slow it down so much. Internet connection to my phone is slightly poor, however it could be my own router. Honestly if you are planning to get the 5g service, and have a good internet connection @ home, theres no reason not to get this device. Up to date with all softwares and filled cool features. Definitely dont regret buying this phone","July 14, 2020"
912,OnePlus 8 Pro,Rayhan Malik,2,"Some great potential here, but for a $1,000 flagship phone it is a huge disappointment.  Others have summarized the good points so I am going to focus on the bad:1.  Despite false advertising, this phone is not dual SIM in the USA at least.  An update has been promised since April ""next update"" but every update it is the same, no dual SIM.2.  The curved edge is critical to control this phone - scrolling, back and forward, etc.  Very cool and it works great except that it is impossible to hold the phone securely without activating the edge controls.  This means you have to hold the phone in the palm of your hand without touching the sides - not an easy trick and it makes it easy to drop the phone.3.  Because of the edge control issue, cases are poorly made for this phone.  I have tried three including the official OnePlus case, and all have the same issue - the edge protector ridge interferes with the swiping needed for edge control functions.4.  We have a documented issue where messages SMS that messages that are actually sent show up as unsent.  This problem reappears from time to time and OnePlus tech supports only answer is to totally reset the phone from firmware boot ROM (losing all apps and app data).  I just ignore the "" message not sent"" errors now but that is unacceptable in a flagship.4. Battery life is really so so.  I got a lot more life on my Moto z4.  Maybe the issue is the impressive 120hz display which looks amazing.  But battery life is just too short... In heavy use it doesn't last more than 6-7 hours.  Again, not bad for a mid-range but a flagship must do better.","August 11, 2020"
913,OnePlus 8 Pro,Baltazar Santiaqo Lopez,4,"First time buying a OnePlus phone.  I have been a Samsung Galaxy user from versions 4 through 10.  Early initial impressions:  The screen is large and easy to read, data transfer was pretty painless.  But the big gotcha so far is Bluetooth pairing.  The candidate list shows with just MAC addresses, and not names, and it doesn't show many of my devices where I had no problem identifying them with the older Samsung S9.  The OnePlus forums are full of people having similar issues.  Messed around with the dev settings a bit, but no luck so far.  I am hoping OnePlus can fix this via a software patch and that this isn't a BT antenna problem.","January 29, 2021"
914,OnePlus 8 Pro,Chicago family,5,"So I have 5 reasons why you should buy this.1: Battery recharges from 0 - 100 in 45 minutes and lasts 3-4 days with the right settings. (Stop using 90hz, use battery saver, use bedtime mode at night, etc.) The phone checks constantly for updates and that uses a TON of battery, you can still get notifications but instead of checking every 10 seconds, it checks every 5 mins.2: I got it for 380$ and it sells for 700$ at MSRP.3: It's fast.4: It can be used on virtually any carrier.5: The camera is the best I have ever seen and works well with 3rd party camera software.Cons:None.Recommendation? Yes. Much yes. Very yes. Yes.","October 12, 2021"
915,OnePlus 8 Pro,TechnoFiend,5,"I always buy phones based on how easy it is to root, completeness of aftermarket firmware and design. I hate ads and use system wide adblock, but also want to be in control of my software. OnePlus is known for having a community behind their phones that develops custom software for aftermarket support, further extending the life of the device.Fingerprint reader is miles better than the 6t I used to have. 5g is great, no issues with signal, battery is decent but running 120hz and 1440p constantly definitely increases battery drain, so keep that in mind. I get about 6 or so hours of SOT but you can improve that by going down to 60hz.If you can get this phone new for $600 or less in 2021 it's a good phone that will last you awhile.","June 25, 2021"
916,OnePlus 8 Pro,Jeremy Whitaker,3,"This was a replacement for my beloved 6T that was damaged by some chemical leaking on it. While it certainly has some great new capabilities (especially the camera and 5G) I just don't love it like I did the old one. The wireless connection is a little finicky. Its size and the center camera make it less comfortable to use, and although I guess it's faster than the 6T I find myself waiting for pages to load when I open a new browser. Also, I'm a little worried about the screen. There are a couple of tiny nicks on the rounded edge, you can't see them unless the light is just right and I didn't notice them sliding my fingers up and down until my fingernail snagged one once. I don't know whether they were there when the phone arrived, but it's never been dropped and I don't know what could have caused them. A good phone for the money, to be sure, but I'm a little disappointed with the upgrade.","June 25, 2021"
917,OnePlus 8 Pro,Gordon Freeman,5,"I am one of those people who uses their phone for years until it finally dies. That being said I got this one because my old phone died! I'm not into phone specs but my husband had been researching for a great phone for a affordable price (I think it's bonkers to pay $1,000 for a phone). I have to say this phone fits all the check boxes we both wanted. I absolutely love it. It runs really fast and has a long battery life. For a minimalist like myself the coolest feature is the dual screen (I can check texts while still watching youtube). It is very light weight, slim, and long (one of the longest phones I have owned). The only drawback that I have so far is the slide bar for the sound, and lack of cute cases. Other than that it is an amazing phone and I highly recommend it.","June 21, 2020"
918,OnePlus 8 Pro,Mark,3,"Just received. All works great so far after I removed most of the junk apps comes with the phone that I don't use. Some of the junk app like ""game store"" cannot even be disabled, what a shame OnePlus! It does not have Alexa app, so I don't have to uninstall it. I don't need half-baked 5G, so there is no reason to spend more money it. Price is good now that we don't have many choices. After competitors were kicked out of US, the price of the very limited brands of high-end phones only goes up, which does not worth it.Update: I use AT&T network and the cell phone signal inside my house is not good. We occasionally see issues in phone call. Tried to make a few phone calls using this one and the voice is choppy. Meanwhile other two phones from Huawei and Motorola worked well. This is no issue when the signal is very good.","September 4, 2021"
919,OnePlus 8 Pro,Dylan Whisnant,5,"I am going to begin this review the same as of few other enthusiasts have stated. The bad reviews because of the ""integrated Alexa"" Need to be removed. Its an app you can choose to install or not. People need to know what they are talking about before leaving a troll review.As for the phone. It is awesome so far. The oneplus 8 pro is a beast of a phone. The battery life has been great. The 30 watt charging is impressive. 5g in my area is awesome. the 120hz refresh is buttery smooth. This phone is simply fantastic. My ONLY complaint is the screen protectors that come in the box are not great. They will make due for now. But they leave a lot to desired. At the moment their are no good options for glass screen protectors. Hoping we see some good ones soon.","May 14, 2020"
920,OnePlus 8 Pro,Jack,4,This is a great phone overall.  I've had it for about a month.  The only downside is that I already have a small crack on the side of the screen.  No drops.  I am unsure where the crack came from. The screen is slightly curved on the edge and this may have contributed since it sticks out of the case a little. I am upgrading to a completely covered case to try and prolong the phone's life.,"October 19, 2021"
921,OnePlus 8 Pro,Tyler,3,"Update:So I wanted to update my review to be a little more fair.  The phone is great!  I do love it but I had to switch carriers.  I was eventually going to be on T-Mobile, due to the merger, so I just jumped ship early.The phone being great still doesn't provide 5 stars due to the company being incorrect about who can support the phone.  If OnePlus wants to update their info about Sprint and reach out to me to admit they were incorrect at the time of my purchase, then I'd consider going up to 5 stars.  Until then, 3 stars due to incorrect information provided by OnePlus.Original:Before I purchased this phone I asked both a Sprint rep and a OnePlus rep if the phone would be compatible.  OnePlus stated it was an unlocked version so it would be and Sprint said if it was unlocked it would be.  Phone came in about an hour ago and here I am unable to activate it on the Sprint network.DO NOT BUY IF YOU'RE ON SPRINT!  Unless you want to switch providers.","June 16, 2020"

Fortunately the face unlock is fast but I don't know who the idiot was at OnePLus who decided to put that crappy in Display fingerprinter reader combined with an enrollment time out. It took me 20 tries to get one fingerprint registered. Ridiculous. Also OnePlus has little to no support in the US. You can email them but usually their replies make no sense and your ticket will get passed from person to person, all of whom say the same thing NOTHING. Even with all that, I'm still a fan of OnePLus phones and have owned many since the OnePLus One","August 7, 2020"
923,OnePlus 8 Pro,Dustin,4,"Its a great phone, feature rich affordable price. Came with a charger, simple case, and screen protector. Its unlocked, works on verizon but you have to contact them either by call or web chat to fully activate the phone, because out of the box it can only make/receive calls and send text but not recive them, so thats why you have to contact verizon. The battery life is ok, probably wont last all day, but thats the price you pay for a smooth 120hz 1440p display. Has good stereo speakers, and HDR support. overall happy with the phone.","April 2, 2021"
924,OnePlus 8 Pro,Daniel G Satalino,5,"I got this phone to replace my aging Galaxy S8. I was a bit skeptical because my last deviation from the Samsung line was not that great of a phone, but I stuck with it till its end of life. After getting my data transferred over (easy due to Android transfer) I starting using this phone for everyday tasks to ensure it would be a viable replacement. I can say without reservation that this phone has thoroughly impressed me. The screen resolution and refresh rate make all the apps smooth and easy to read. The OnePlus interface isn't bloated and let's me configure the device down to the smallest level, which I love.

It is like u take the black punch hole camera and move it to the upper right hand corner and when it is moved out of the screen 1/4 of it is left and it is there permanent. Pretty big bummer and of course OnePlus said they can repair it but I have to send my phone on and I won't have it for 2-3 weeks ... Really ? They would replace it even when it is still brand new ... OnePlus has been Meh from the beginning since the phone came out ... They never had enough phones and there website didn't work right when trying to sell it at certain dates ....tons of complaints. So what do I do, I have to keep it I guess ... At least I am a prime member and the Amazon concierge have me some money on return back. Not happy with OnePlus.Also the camera is not really up to par ... When taking pictures on light it has very bad reflections in it ... Not that good after using a pixel device for a while ...Update: even the latest camera update hasn't done anything .... every shots from my wife's new note 20 and this 8 Pro and Geeez are the shots from the note 20 Ultra better ... Downloaded the new UI 11 and I may as well have a note 20. Very unhappy with this phone ... At this point to not going to recommend it anymore ... OnePlus, I am super disappointed!

If I'm playing games long enough my hands get tired and sore from holding it after a while, it's probably at least 3 times heavier than my last phone.

It appears you can end up in a situation like myself where you are unable to receive text messages. I have been working w/ Verizon since Saturday to try and resolve to no avail. Outside of that, this should be the flagship phone for Android. Much better specs than we're seeing for the pixel 5 currently.Update: Having used the phone for the last month or so, it's still super buggy. I have issues w/ not being able to hear people who call me (intermittently), but I can hear them just fine if I call them, both on wifi(messenger) and over regular phone calls. Location services seems to not be right. I'll try and share my location, but it never updates, the ability to turn location always on is missing for a lot of apps. Issues sending MMS/Images over SMS. Some of this may be related to verizon, and I will know when my new sim card arrives, but I think a lot of it is due to custom OS that the OnePlus uses and apps not working properly with it. I would return if I could, but it appears that window has come and gone.","September 28, 2020"
948,OnePlus 8 Pro,Mark,1,"Things I like about this phone: photo quality, screen quality, processing speed and touch responsiveness.Things I absolutely hate about this phone: mobile data is almost non-working. I have tried factory resetting the phone, resetting the sim card, updating APN, etc. and it still is horrible. I can't hardly even receive phone calls without being on wifi.I wanted to originally get away from Samsung because I thought OnePlus has less bloatware and more bang for your buck but I deeply regret my decision. I bought my wife the same phone and hers works way better than mine, although still with connectivity issues.I will never buy another OnePlus product again!","March 20, 2024"
949,OnePlus 8 Pro,Dylan Whisnant,5,"The phone has 2 simslots and one was disabled with the software that came out of the box. After the Android update the issue was fixed and works correctly. The camera takes great pictures and the on screen finger print reader works great. The only ""downside"" I see is that the phone does not have a button for home or back to fit a bigger screen, therefore you need to use swipe gestures to go back or go home.","September 4, 2021"
950,OnePlus 8 Pro,Bailey,5,This phone is amazing. My friend has a s20 and claimed it was faster with a better screen. Geek bench proved the fast issue greatly in my phone's favor and while on paper his screen sounds better in a comparison of the two my phone was more vibrant with better saturation and killed the refresh rate. If you want a flagship in 2021 don't spend all that money this phone is still absolutely amazing.,"October 18, 2021"
951,OnePlus 8 Pro,Marcelo Leon,4,"The phone is fast, great screen gaulity, as well as, sound. 5G is currently only available from T-Mobile and that might be spotty.

955,OnePlus 8 Pro,David Lewis,5,"I upgraded from a Galaxy S8 to get the OnePlus 8pro(blue) and it's a huge upgrade for me, it's a really beautiful phone in person and it feels amazing to hold. This will be a phone to last me for years. It's really fast and I love the screen 120hz QHD+. Also Alexa is optional until you set it up so don't let this ""Alexa"" stop you from buying a great phone. You can just use Google assistant. I game on my phone alot on the highest settings so expect the battery to drain fast. Overall I don't regret buying it.","May 15, 2020"
956,OnePlus 8 Pro,Curt Magurt,5,Best phone I've ever owned!!! The camera is really underrated. I didn't get the wireless charger from here but it's a must have also. The charger is the best ever and it's not even as good as the 8T. My girl has an iphone 11 and my phone charges more than twice as fast wirelessly or on a wire. When it says warp charge it means warp charge. Even better is the reverse charge overall I completely love the 8pro,"December 19, 2020"
957,OnePlus 8 Pro,Curt Magurt,5,Love the OnePlus brand and switching from my 6 was easy. The screen is beautiful but it is a little big. Will take some getting used to also the curved screen would be a lot more annoying if I didn't have a heavy duty case on it. It was on sale so I pulled the trigger but I would go 8t if you don't want curved glass. The battery is very good which was my main reason for switching from my old 6,"November 15, 2020"

I tried everything, spent hours and hours on hold over the course of two weeks. They sent me a new SIM. They sent an offline request to add it to their device database. They couldn't recognize the IMEI number as a valid device at all and so they couldn't manually add it.The phone itself is great. Easy to unlock and root.

964,OnePlus 7T DualSIM,Charles Despres,5,"This is simply a GREAT phone. I bought it at $500 2 months ago and now you can find it under $400, which is a steal for this level of performance and refinement. Coming from a OnePlus 6 with the fingerprint reader intelligently placed on the back, where my index fingers land every time, I find the screen-based reader awkward, but the face unlock is better than both and works great for me. Highly recommend this model, more than the 7Pro with its motorized selfie camera (simpler is better and more reliable) and the wisdom of staying a couple of generations behind the bleeding (expensive, risky) edge in this fast-moving industry.","September 17, 2020"

967,OnePlus 7T DualSIM,Kelly Newell,4,"This product could not be added to the Verizon network. The stateside 7T is a different model number than the international model (which this is) and because of that Verizon would not add my device to the network. Troubleshooting this was a Kafka-esque experience, so if you are considering attempting it do read on and decide if you can live with some kind of work-around for text messaging.The phone is great. The only thing I didn't like is that the vibrate motor is very weak even on high power. It is, however, very smooth and quick to start and stop for tactile feedback. The phone is quick to load and switch between apps, google play app store works with it, screen was bright and very smooth with the 90hz refresh rate. The battery would last me about a day and a half, I would use it to punch in at work, chat with clients for maybe 30 min total, check a message board or website for maybe an hour total, and that's it. I'm not a heavy phone user. I wanted something responsive, with an LED screen (never want to go back to LCD) and good battery life and a good camera for social media crap, at a price that wouldn't drain my wallet. Most manufacturers only offer that level of competence on their flagships and at ~$1000 so I was happy to find this phone. I was extremely pleased with the device and wish I could keep it.It has been a month since I mailed it back and I still haven't received a refund. Not sure what the deal is with that, but I'm waiting on the refund so that I can hopefully get a US model. Amazon has always been prompt in the past so I don't know what the hold up is...Putting this phone on Verizon goes like this: Vzw defaults to sending a device texts through CDMA unless it is flagged as a CDMA-less device. This device needs that flag because it has no CDMA antenna. You can't set that flag unless the device is officially added to the network. They won't add it to the network because the model number is different from the US released model, which is the only one that is 'verified' to workThis took a month of back and forth through the tech support chat app. Vzw would close my tickets without notifying me or giving any kind of resolution brief. No way to track the issue in order to bring the next tech up to speed. I had to track it all myself and then argue my case and present the findings of the previous tier 2 techs just to get past the tier 1 techs and have an add-device request form submitted to some shadow division of the company. I'd be told I would be notified how it went, then it would get closed and I wouldn't get notified, and I'd have to start all over again. Loads of fun. At least tech support staff was patient with me and as helpful as I could hope for given the communication and documentation challenges.Why not just call tech support? Because Verizon's phone-in tech support requires you to receive text messages, which is the problem in the first place. I set up an in-person appointment but when I arrived I was informed that they no longer do tech support in person due to the Covid plague.Otherwise, the phone works great; makes and receive's calls, downloads and uploads data. The Vzw techs insist that the phone lacks software that allows it to be compatible with their network, but everything on the phone works with the network aside from that text/CDMA flag issue, which leads me to believe the tier 1 techs are working with very limited information. I could be wrong, who knows.","August 24, 2020"
968,OnePlus 7T DualSIM,Destine Solorio,1,"From almost day one I had problems, both with dropped calls and with incoming calls not ringing at all but going straight to voicemail. The tech support people are beyond useless. I chatted with them a few times about these issues; their standard fix, and really the only thing they recommend, is wiping the cache, which never fixes anything.I would not recommend buying this phone.","July 14, 2020"
969,OnePlus 7T DualSIM,Dan Edmonds,2,I wouldn't pay more than $250 for this phone knowing what I know now but I bought when it was new but now the charge barely charges and it's slow ad ND freezes all the time And geeks out. Don't so it friends I'm going back to Samsung,"August 10, 2020"
970,OnePlus 8 5G,Ron,5,"So I bought this phone and immediately sent in to OnePlus for the unlock token.  They took over a month and it got to the point where I was emailing them every couple of days.  This doesn't sound typical; most people say they got the unlock_token in 2 weeks.After I got the unlock token, I wiped the phone and installed LineageOS and then switched over to the /e/ OS.  Everything works flawlessly.  I haven't been able to unlock the dual sim yet, but with the de-googled operating system, I only have to charge my phone every 3-4 days.","February 28, 2023"
971,OnePlus 8 5G,J Lee Thompson,4,"This phone is unlocked, but it's branded with ""T-Mobile"" and comes with a T-Mobile sim card.  It basically appears to be a T-Mobile carrier, but it worked fine when I put my Ting sim card in, no issues.  It was confusing to set-up because I was so nervous that I received a locked phone by mistake.  The seller should include instructions on how to set-up for other carriers besides T-Mobile.  The phone itself has worked well so far.  Quick apps and charging, decent photos.  The color of the phone doesn't look like the photos.  The back is an ombre that goes from pink to blue, sort of sunset-looking.","June 1, 2022"
972,OnePlus 8 5G,Ron,5,"This phone does everything well at a fraction of the price of the newest model.  Doesn't have wireless charging or waterproof, but I don't care. Very fast! Very happy.","March 30, 2022"
973,OnePlus 8 5G,lightninglesley,3,"I really wanted to like this phone, but it has a lot of problems.PROS* Works in Google Fi* Powerful! - It rates highly in Geekbench* Charging - using the supplied wall adapter and USB cable, charging is very fast* Camera - takes great pictures and videosOKAY* Screen - brightest setting could be brighter* Volume - highest setting could be louder* Side buttons - I like the placement, but often accidentally take screenshots when I'm not intending toCONS* No aux port for headphones* No micro SD card support* Too many unnecessary apps installed that you can't uninstall (unless you use ADB)* Duplicate apps* Calling over WiFi - had to jump through hoops to get such a simple feature to work* Can't call over WiFi while in airplane mode* Curved screenTo go into detail on a couple things listed above, I have Google Fi, and the last 4 phones I've had allowed me to turn on airplane mode, then turn on WiFi, and I could make and receive calls and send and receive texts.  With this phone I can't!  I have to have airplane mode off.I often don't get notified of a voicemail until I restart my phone.  Same thing for some text messages, I don't get them unless I restart the phone, or in some cases, just leave my apartment, which disconnects me from my WiFi and has me just on the Fi service data.Out of the box, the phone had several duplicate apps, including: Contacts, Phone, and a few others I can't remember.  If you know how to, you can use ADB to uninstall some apps, but you have to know the full name in order to do so, and I can't figure that out for some.  Also, the lone settings app I have access to seems to fit the same OnePlus theme, which makes me think I'm not able to use the stock android settings app.Lastly, the curved screen design is terrible!  I don't understand how people can put up with this.  I'm often accidentally tapping on the sides of an app when all I'm trying to do is hold the phone.  You really need one of those ring or popsocket cases in order to hold the phone without touching the sides.  Also, the curved bezel around the corners means some important info in certain apps is obscured.  I also noticed that the keyboard, while in landscape mode, has a gap below it (probably due to the curved screen), and in some apps, tapping the gap causes the keyboard to disappear.  This is very frustrating when trying to press the space bar that is *supposed* to be at the bottom of the screen but isn't.OVERALLDue to how powerful this phone is, I would definitely consider another OnePlus phone.  However, not if it has all of the same issues this one has.","July 27, 2022"
974,OnePlus 8 5G,gordon,2,"It has only been two days with this unit. I purchased this in a hurry because my wife's phone was on the fritz. I don't know how more emphatically I can state this, but the phone has been treated like a new-born baby and upon careful inspection of the screen, there seems to ALREADY be very slight and almost unrecognizable CRACKS?NO, the phone was not dropped.No, the phone wasn't bumped, bruised, jarred, tossed or thrown.The box the phone came in appeared to be a brand new device, but something tells me this is not a new item or this phone has a serious flaw I don't know about. I'm just puzzled. Should I return it, get a different phone?","December 4, 2021"
975,OnePlus 8 5G,J Lee Thompson,1,"I bought this phone in October 2021. It overheats often 3 or more times a week, while in shade with conditions of 83 F. When it gets hot  - it REALLY gets hot to the touch. It's particularly distressing when you use it as a GPS and it suddenly overheats , becomes dim, turns off most apps and then shuts down for over 15 minutes. I tried speaking to the support crew - the first one wanted me to delete my cache and data not warning me that I will lose all the data on my phone. I wasted 1 hour on the phone , asked for a supervisor three times before I was finally transferred to one who said i should send in my phone it would take 10 days from receipt to repair - yep I would not recommend this phone.","July 15, 2022"

978,OnePlus 8 5G,Quinn Mood,5,I am absolutely in amazement to this phone and the quality and the features it has along with the color and the price everything I'm so happy that I actually went through with purchasing this cell phone through this company. I was very hesitant after reading the reviews if you're like me you read reviews and you search and you compare before you purchase anything on Amazon but in this case I went ahead and decided to purchase even with the hesitation and I figured I could return if anything were to not workout.So delivery and shipping were fast although they did leave this package in the cold and since I live in Alaska that was not a very smart decision as far as mailing wise so I would suggest the seller to put a signature on cell phones so that they actually have to drop off the merchandise at the door with a signature they never did that in my case I don't know if that was supposed to be like that because it did save delivery signature on it but they never did that in this case so my phone could potentially could have been damaged by being in negative 10° weather since I live in Alaska and it's the middle of December 2021.However needless to say I knew that it was coming so I waited for the mail and I was able to get it out of the mailbox within an hour of it being delivered so my phone works just fine when I received this phone it was at 13% charged so I just went ahead and I charged the remainder of it while it was off and then when I was at 100% with the charger that came with it then I turned it on for the first time.One of my concerns were that it was not going to be unlocked truly even though a lot of sites or websites or pages stay that they are unlocked cell phones in most cases they are not luckily in this case going through this company with this OnePlus T-Mobile cell it was unlocked because as soon as I answered my SIM card the settings automatically reset and was compatible with my cell phone company that I go through for my telephone service. I believe I go through AT&t but it's GCI so general communications Incorporated so if anybody is wondering it will be compatible and it will work do not lose the silver little key that it comes with because that is how you take your sim card in and out of the phone you put that little key and you press it into the hole and it will eject onto the side of the phone and that is where you place your sim card into.Now the OnePlus 8 have a glass plated backing on it to where it appears to be a pink and yellow color or ombre color to it but it person and in reality when you receive the phone and open it yourself and look at it it's like it's glass it's more of a reflective than it is a solid color or an ombre color.I love it but it was not as it what I thought it would be but I love it even more so I cannot describe the appearance of this phone now I've always used Android cell phones I have never used or purchased a iPhone myself so coming from a Samsung phone or an LG phone or a Nokia phone this is very impressive. The OnePlus 8 has 128 GB I believe it has wireless charging capabilities it has an amazing 90 liquid hurts display screen on this type of cell phone and the capturing image on the photos are immaculate quality. I love that this style and this updated Windows Android 11 operating system has the perfect fingerprint authentication lock screen so that no one can access your phone without having your actual fingerprint pressed onto the phone it works instantaneously there's other phones that I've had before that were never as accurate as getting the correct imprint of my finger but this phone is amazing at this technology nowadays.I've had this phone for up to almost a week and it last me all day long on the charge now this was I believe a refurbished phone it was not a brand new phone at that so lasting all day long with the way I use my phone 24/7 throughout the day is pretty good for me I used to have to charge my phone constantly through the day throughout the day with this I do not I just charged this at night when I'm sleeping and in the morning it's at 100% and by the end of the night when I go to sleep it's at about 20% still. My recommendation is to not purchase a brand new phone go ahead and get the refurbished version if you if you can afford the new phone go for it it's all you but if you're trying to save a little bit go for the refurbished phone that's unlocked I believe this goes works and is compatible with CDMA and GSM technology and also has 5G and lower on this style phone. So everything was validated I'm going to see an update this review as time goes on before my 30 days if anything is to happen I still can return it I have about 3 weeks left on my return policy or I believe it was 90 days policy it might have been I need a check on that but if it's a 30-day window or whether it's a 90-day window on refurbished cell phones I still have that time frame to be able to replace this spell if anything was to happen or the battery does not charge correctly or if I notice anything that's not correct or the amount of money that I purchased this with I should be able to return or get my money fulfilled if it's not my satisfaction or if it's not up to my standards that is what I love about Amazon and I'm very happy with the seller go for it buy one you'll be happy you won't be upset or disappointed I hope this review helps somebody make a decision for a new cell phone with the one plus any version is good with the one plus I'm sure this is my first OnePlus cell phone and I will never buy another Samsung again it is not worth enough to purchase another Samsung for such an over evaluated price compared to the OnePlus which is drastically half the price in reduction to the cell phones this is my opinion and my suggestion stands. Thank you for looking at my review and good luck!,"December 19, 2021"

OMG im running 12gb ram in this!? ive never run out of space, or seen a low disk space notification. battery still lasts all day listnening to music, with 4G/5G and wifi, bluetooth on all the time. if only i could use the fast charge..... Superb phone!","December 31, 2022"

999,OnePlus 6T A6013,Kevin B,5,"If you don't care about having the newest $1k+ phone and your image of having the newest cool gadget, this gets the job done! Takes great pictures and I get around 3 solid days of battery life. I have bought a couple of unlocked phones from amazon and never had any issues. I'm on the Verizon network and I just popped my sim card in and turned it on! Literally that easy! If you have Verizon this will work, even though the boot screen does say T-mobile. I will never finance a phone and have no problem using a phone that was released a year ago. Its fast and it's not obnoxiously huge.. My only problem is I wished it would accept a SD card, as 128gb of storage isnt room for much any more. I have no problem backing up my videos and photos to my desktop at home. Great price and superb product! Would not hesitate to buy again or any OnePlus product!","August 31, 2020"
1000,OnePlus 6T A6013,Daniel Davis,5,"I had a difficult time sending text messages with Verizon as my carrier.  But the support person at Verizon made one technical adjustment to my account, and it worked fine.The phone is excellent. Fast, great display, and excellent battery life. The only negative is the speaker. There is only one speaker, and it is down firing. It is loud, but I was used to stereo speakers on my Pixel 2XL, and thereafter my iPhone Xr.However, especially for the price, it is a great deal. Right now using it is my daily driver.","June 23, 2020"
1001,OnePlus 6T A6013,Kevin B,5,"Value is insanely good. Recommend trying for a mint Oneplus experience on a budget I'm finally ditching my iPhone 7... Quality of packaging & phone build is better than most I've seen and overall surpassed my huawei experience which I didn't know if would be the case.. Mine came in original box with the Oneplus charger & pprwork/Sim tool/case etc.. The box itself was a little roughed and phone did restart while activating tmobile Sim but everything works perfect and no scratch/indication of ever being used, I haven't even bothered unlocking it yet not sure if I will.. Worth noting that if you want the phone unlocked the instructions come in the box to open an app already installed & enter a ""oneplus approved"" unlock code.Overall very dope experience and appreciate the people getting these awesome phones out at these prices","June 11, 2020"
1002,OnePlus 6T A6013,Gary Auerbach,5,"When I went to buy the phone I had my reservations because of all of the buyer beware comments. But when I got the phone and put my sim in. Any reservations I had went away. It fired right up and stared working like it was supposed to. After further inspection I noticed that the phone said it was an a6013 model and looked it up to no avail. So I called OnePlus and spoke with them about the model number. They told my that the only major difference with the a6010 and a6013 was that the a6013 was the dual SIM China unlocked model and that even if I did receive that phone instead it would have still functioned fine here in the US. The sim slots and startup screen are the only differences between the phone.The only down side about buying the one that I did. Is it didn't come with a charger or cable and if you want to use dash charging or any kind of fast charging on the oneplus 6t you will need a charger that works with their proprietary charging system.  But it did come with a pre-installed screen protectorThat all being said, It is a great phone for what I paid and I'd buy it again in a heart beat.","August 12, 2020"
1003,OnePlus 6T A6013,Josh H,4,"Thoughts: first thing I noticed out of the box was the screen wasn't as big as I expected. It's marketed at 6.4 inches. The LGs I'm used to are far larger to my expectations. However, not a big deal for the OnePlus 6T.Setup was easy as usual with my Google account. FYI, for anyone on Verizon. This works nicely with Verizon. Hesitated buying this phone because of CDMA issues. Internet, messeging and video work perfectly. The only thing that doesn't work right off the bat was, I couldn't receive SMS messages. Not make phone calls with Verizon. Haven't fixed that for a week now. I used a third party phone app called, TextNow. Calls work fine on there. But, left out of SMS texts & calls. Other than that, all works fine (internet-wise).As color goes, nice colors. Saturated. AMOLED. I noticed it has perfect darks. Unlike LCD smartphones. Blacks are superb and rich. No backlit blacks.Audio on OP6T is average. Compared to my Pixel XL. OP6T lacks decent audio. It's fine for it's use. Just really muffled audio. Not good highs. Poor base. Mids are ok. Almost sounds like mono. The downfiring speaker is ok. Loud enough for general use. Nothing special.OP6T comes with a USB-C to 3.5mm Jack for your headphones. It's a converter, it is not stocked.There's a notch for the camera that can be changed in case you don't like the notch thing. I personally don't mind the notch.My OP6T came as the T-Mobile variant. In which I converted to global version. So that makes things better. Still works great.OP6T markets as 128GB but, once formatted it's about 105GB (for both T-Mobile & global variant). I'm on Android 10. With latest OxygenOS, 10.3.5. Very fast phone. Haven't noticed any slow downs. Great buy.Good: 128gb lots of space , flagship killer, CDMA/ GSM capable. Verizon limited. Solid built. Fast phone. 3,700 battery last me a day. Will have updates till 2021 and with Android 11 future update.Bad: Verizon limited, SMS and call problems. Audio is pretty lame, slow fingerprint reader, T-Mobile variant (can be removed just Google it. Voids warranty) and no MicroSD card slot for stage expansion. You'll need an OTG device for backing up your files and or online storage like Google drive. Otherwise there is always there option to hook OP6T to your PC.Camera: No opinion. Don't care at all for the camera. I use it for general use, only.","July 31, 2020"
1004,OnePlus 6T A6013,Josh H,5,"This is the best phone that I’ve ever had.  Everything works as expected and it’s very fast.  I don’t know why people complain about the finger printer reader on the screen.  This one works as well as the rear mounted fingerprint reader only my last couple of phones.  I was little unsure about buying a phone without a headphone jack.  So, I used the money I saved on the phone and bought some wireless earbuds and I will never go back to wired headphones.  It’s so much easier to leave my phone on a table and walk around the house doing things without having to deal with the wires.  Now I use my headphones way more than I used to.  Do yourself a favor and get some wireless headphones with this phone.","January 27, 2019"
1005,OnePlus 6T A6013,StarHammer88,1,"The phone that is being describe is not what’s being sold. I purchased my device Feb 22, 2019 and received it the next day. When it arrived it was out of its plastic wrapping and the phone box was damaged. This didn’t really bother me because I was excited about the phone. I continued to set the phone up and unpack everything and noticed everything was in Chinese. This didn’t really bother me either because despite me getting a different model from what is being described and advertised from the seller, the phone itself is AMAZING. The OnePlus 6T is worth buying if you’re looking for a low budget high end phone and I did extensive research before buying to make sure I got the correct model seeing as it distributed from a Chinese manufacturer. The model that is being described is the A6013 but my model I got was the A6010. The 13 is the global model and the 10 is the China/India model. I decided to try and see if I could live with the model I got and my LTE data doesn’t work in most areas. This was a real slap in the face and will be returning the device and buying straight from the OnePlus website. I would recommend anyone wanting this phone to do the same.","February 26, 2019"
1006,OnePlus 6T A6013,Jesse R,3,"One of the best features of OnePlus phones is a fairly vanilla Android ROM (firmware) with *relatively* low amounts of bloatware and spyware pre-installed.  OnePlus phones can all be flashed with better, privacy-centered ""ungoogled"" AOSP firmware by a very simple and instant user-unlock method, which makes them some of the best devices around for security, privavy and open-source-minded users.Apparently not so with the T-Mobile branded versions...T-Mobile packs a load of bloatware, spyware apps and spyware ""system services"" into their firmware image.  T-Mobile spies on you and sells your information that they gather this way, there is no way to opt out or prevent this from happening without removing the spyware from the ROM itself**, so T-Mobile has a monetary incentive to take the ability away from you to remove that garbage from the phone:  They lock the bootloader with an encryption key which you have to request and wait weeks for (if they give it to you at all)People familiar with phone modding will be familiar with this anti-consumer rights / anti-ownership process.  A 14 day wait period to unlock is not as egregious as manufacturers who lock you out of it permanently (or wait much longer).  But its completely unacceptable, especially for manufacturers which have a reputation for allowing you to use your device however you wish.Remeber: If you can't fully use, control or repair your device because someone is preventing you from doing so, you don't own your device.Corporation who sell you things you aren't allowed to own are stealing from you.For those curious: - The bootsplash is the pink T-Mobile screen - There's about a dozen spyware apps.  Be sure to nuke the radio hooks, esp if you want to use a Mint APN - OEM/bootloader unlock procedure is available through oneplus's website.  Wait is supposedly 7-14 days. - You can still rootlessly (sorta) remove the T-Mobile bloatware/spyware PER-USER in the interim period through the usual method with ADB, with the caveat that any OTA update can/will reinstall them all over again.","March 6, 2022"
1007,OnePlus 6T A6013,Jesse R,4,"The description says that it is a factory unlocked phone while in reality it is an unlocked TMobile device. The phone is a model A6013 and can be used on the Verizon network with a little tweaking. I am currently on tracphone plan using a Verizon SIM card.When I first tried to send a text or connect to the network it wouldn't work. I did a little research on line and found that the device has to be set to use Vo-LTE. This can be easily enabled by dialing *#*#4636#*#* selecting ""phone information"" and changing the preferred network type to ""LTE/UMTS auto (PRL)"". Once I did that everything started working normally.The phone came in a white box and was wrapped in buble wrap. It was in fair condition for being a used phone. It had 2 unnoticeable scratches and a small pit that is barely noticeable when the screen is off. The back has some small pitting around the edges of the lense like it had been in a case.Overall I am happy with the phone in general. It kinda ticks me that it is a TMobile unlocked phone and shows the pink splash screen at startup but not enough to send it back. Another thing to note is that the back of the phone is incredibly slippery and easily dropped. Other than that I am happy with the phone. Possibly in the future I will reflash the software to the factory unlocked so that I can debrand the phone.","November 9, 2019"
1008,OnePlus 6T A6013,CPL,4,"Incredible phone, better than $1000 iPhones and Samsungs. Blazing speeds for games. Camera isn't super awesome but I don't care cause I don't take pictures. They sent the Chinese/Indian model and not the US. This is true of both of the phones I bought. The box says A6013 but the phones are both A6010. Not a big deal so far here in Michigan or Ohio, but some areas may use different frequencies causing you to lose service but I'm not overly concerned personally. The difference between the A6013 and the A6010 is like 2 or 3 frequencies, I can't remember just Google it of you feel it will be a problem. That's the only reason why I gave the phone 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the mislabeling/false advertising. The battery is incredible often lasting 2 days or more if you don't use it all day. I can usually get 36+ hours and 7-8 hours of screentime before charging.","July 13, 2019"
1009,OnePlus 6T A6013,Kevin B,3,"First things first, this is a great phone. More than I expected for the price. However it's listed as an a6013, but what they don't tell you is that this is a T-Mobile variant that has been unlocked and had global firmware installed. It will come with Android 9 and will be fully functional but will not receive any OTA updates. If you get curious about not getting any updates when it says Android 10 is available for the a 6013, you will receive instructions to install oxygen updater to get you updated. Once you update to Android 10 you will no longer be play protect certified and you cannot download certain apps like Netflix or Disney Plus, other things will stop working like Google pay. If you go through and arduous process to downgrade back to Android 9 those things will function again however there is no workaround to getting these functions on Android 10. I've been searching high and low for over a year now. Other than that the phone still quick and snappy where the Samsung my mother got is bogged down and frustratingly slow.","August 9, 2021"
1010,OnePlus 6T A6013,Daniel Davis,3,"The box was sealed with the manufacturer's sticker so it was a good start to know that I got a new phone. It's unlocked, but you need to unlock it manually from one of the T-Mobile apps installed. Checked version of phone before I did it to make sure it was the A6013 model, since I planned to use it on Republic Wireless and that's the only version they support. After getting it working on Republic Wireless, I started to clean up the phone and delete apps. I deleted all the T-Mobile apps, except for the main T-Mobile app that cannot be uninstalled. You also cannot change the permissions for Call logs, Location, Phone, and SMS. Those are always on. So, they are pretty much can track your usage via this app even though it is an unlocked phone. It is collecting data since the storage and cache for this app are always increasing in size. I force stop the app and delete the storage and cache  whenever I remember, but I know that's not really a fix; just a band-aid. I really like the phone and don't want to give it up, so this is what I will live with. Phone is as amazing as everyone says, even in mid-2020, but the unethical practices of T-Mobile tracking you knocks it down two stars. 3 stars overall.","July 9, 2020"
1011,OnePlus 6T A6013,J Schneider,5,"In 90th percentile for speed. Has Android 9.0 Pie (finally a very mature and polished OS).  Hard switch for ring/vibrate/mute. Huge screen with no buttons, bezels, or wasted real estate.  Fingerprint sensor right on screen.  Love USB-C not caring about orientation of plug, unlike micro-USB.  Headphones via USB-C or Bluetooth only, since no audio jack.  My phone auto-pairs flawlessly to 7 different remembered BT devices in course of a single week.  Android 9.0 now as slick as PalmOS was with Pre.  Have had some problems with OTG so far, and this seems due to changes made for 9.0 OS.

1012,OnePlus 6T A6013,Erwin,5,"A6013 is the T-mobile version for the USA. It's probably the only Chinese manufacturer that supports all the T-mobile bands as opposed to international versions that don't. Oneplus is typically on top of the benchmarks for the same year flagships. Currently, Oneplus 8 uses snapdragon 865 and so Oneplus 6 uses the 845. The price-performance of the 6 is still better than flagship phones of the same year. The performance is way better than current budget phones. It's a lot prettier than the Pixels. Even better, the phone upgrades itself to Android 10 while I was sleeping. Now I brought another one.","May 26, 2020"

I have to say this is the most disappointing phone I have owned yet. All prior models where amazing and I have almost no bad things to say about them but this model is full of problems. Facebook, YouTube, google, Google maps, messenger, Bluetooth, music, calls, have all froze or completely stopped working. This sometimes happens multiple times a day. I've tried to reset and reinstall everything. I have to restart my phone anytime one of them has an issue if I want it to work. It's been like this for the 3 months that I have owned it. The finger print sensor only works 1/3 times, most of the time it'll read your thumb as a fail more than once on an attempt and force you to use a pin anyways, making the in screen reader fairly useless since after timing it, I realised it takes nearly 3 full seconds to get a good read. Im not sure if all one plus 6t devices all behave like this but I'm 100% my device is completely defective which is concerning because mine was listed as being new, with these issues on a new model, I can't imagine how poorly the used and renewed models perform.","August 18, 2020"

1099,OnePlus 7T HD1907,Jay Chambliss,5,"I purchased this phone in November of 2020 to use on AT&T's network.  As soon as I received the phone and popped in the sim card, it worked like a charm.  Beautiful screen, fast refresh rate, great cameras in which I find the macro mode very useful. It updated to Android 11 and it makes my Iphone 11, which I also own, feel like a budget phone.  This phone is smoother and faster in every way.  The one hiccup I had is that at some point around February or March of 2021, when I would switch my Sim from my Iphone to this phone, AT&T would suspend my service and tell me that my phone was not compatible.  I would have to call AT&T and explain that I was just using the phone yesterday and, ""of course it's compatible"".  They would argue with me, but restore my service and the phone would be back to working with 4g LTE. I never understood why they kept suspending my service as my phone never showed any signs of not working with AT&T until they suspended it.  If you keep your Sim in one phone, I don't think this would be an issue, but since I was switching back and forth, they were cutting me off for some mysterious reason.  Fortunately, the last time I switched, it went smooth.  Perhaps the bug is fixed with AT&T.  I can't say so for certain, but his phone is definitely still worth it in 2021. I can't imagine any activities you might do on a phone that this phone cant handle.  Battery life is amazing.  If you're a moderate user like me, you might get two days on a charge.  It's an all around beast of a phone.","July 15, 2021"
1100,OnePlus 7T HD1907,Amazon Customer,5,"My old samsung was officially too old to run my banking apps and kept running out of space and crashing so I needed a new phone. Nothing fancy, just new enough to run everything without issues.I shopped around a LOT (I dont think phones should cost over 300$ but it's virtually impossible to find a solidly good phone that isnt) and I found this.I dropped my ATT nano SIM in during setup and it was instantly on the network, no issues (YAY!) and then I set to work setting everything else up.I gotta say I was SUPER impressed by how little bloatware there is on this phone. So that was a huge plus. I have also found dozens of small features I've missed out on with my 10 year old samsung (like the ability to action within the notification!).But there were also some cool features my friends with their iphone and pixel didnt have. Like the physical switch to choose silent/vibrate/ring without messing with the screen, and separate dedicate media volume buttons on the other side of the phone. And man does this phone get loud! A little distortion at the highest end but lowering to avoid the distortion is still loud.I've been able to add all my apps and settings and such in and the phone is still fast and responsive.Additionally, the display settings have some serious kick. I'm talking OLED TV type kick so that was a big surprise. The cameras appear to be really good as well.All in all I am incredibly happy with this purchase especially since I lucked out on a lightning deal so it was only $300 for me which was the perfect price for this much phone!","January 20, 2021"
1101,OnePlus 7T HD1907,Jay Chambliss,5,"This phone is great... insane value for the money and easily worth double what I paid.  Any number of reviews and youtube videos can tell you that. I'm here to share something different: Cricket is perhaps the worst of the ""bargain"" mobile service providers. Phone gets 5 stars, but this review is a cautionary tale for anyone on Cricket.The OnePlus 7t works fine on the Cricket network until they arbitrarily disable your service for using an unlocked phone rather than one purchased through their stores.  But they lie about this and will tell you that the reason is that they are dropping 3g support, which is BS because 1) this is a flagship phone, not a 3g antique and 2) their own site says they support 3g until Feb 2022.  I have been happily using this phone on their network since 1/11/21 until today. I was driving in an ice storm and the roads were terrible, cars in the ditch everywhere. I tried to call my girlfriend to tell her and her kids not to come to my superbowl party because the roads weren't safe, but my call went through to Cricket customer service who (after a loooong wait) first claimed I hadn't paid my bill, then changed the story to ""you need to buy a new phone from a cricket store"".  I convinced her to reactivate my phone as it was kind of a life and death situation, but she kept telling me to upgrade my device at a cricket store or cricket dot com.My phone worked for one hour before it got deactivated again.If you are on Cricket, buy this phone and switch carriers. I cannot say enough bad about Cricket at this point. Avoid them like the plague. This might sound dramatic, but being a cricket user could have potentially led to injury or worse of my loved ones. Cricket is cheap for a reason.","February 8, 2021"

Great screen, camera, fast, etc. Don't need to pay big for Apple or Samsung, when you can get this for a fraction of the price.And like some others have mentioned, with regards to Verizon, this phone does work perfectly. The only issue we had was with receiving texts, for which we contacted Verizon to activate CDMA-less. They took the IMEI number and within 24 hours, we were able to receive texts perfect. (I know other reviews mentioned GSM-less or something, overall not sure of the difference, but CDMA-less was what I found online for the texting issue and it worked). Definitely get this if you're with Verizon and considering it.Other than receiving texts, everything from data/internet, sending texts all worked fine on the first try with a Verizon sim.","December 5, 2020"

Sometimes in the middle of phone call.Never re-connect automatically, unless manually reboot.A terrible product. What is good of a phone if it cannot call.And the customer service is terrible.To me, the problem is straight forward. All other 3 phones from the 4 line plan work well in the same location, the old phone never failed me in several years. And all the nightmare started with this new phone.However, the customer representative asked me to contact T mobile to resolve the problem.I refused to call t mobile, waiting 30 mins and to asking some a question I do not know.Then they started to  giving me long instruction to debug the phone. holding this key for 15 sec, then holding two keys then release one key ............... Is it crazy to ask customer to do it?Then it comes to common sense question.  They claim that manual re-boot could re-connect the 4G, this phone is consider working well.

They are not signed, so you need to disable device driver signing to do so.Search for ""Disable driver signature enforcement"" , and follow the steps to boot windows into unchecked signature mode.Plug in your OnePlus 7t, and if USB debugging is enabled, turn it off so the virtual drive loads containing the OnePlus 7t drivers setup. Proceed with installation. You will get a red dialog warning about the unsigned driver.

The added benefit of type c charging, in screen finger print reader, and it being on sale for around $400.00 made it such a good deal that I bought another for my daughter for Christmas!

1124,OnePlus 7T HD1907,Yvan,5,I won't reiterate everything that others have said. It's a great phone. Fast looks great..

Constant system notifications that the device will not let you turn off. I tried customer service and their only suggestion is to do a factory reset.

I think ill get bored of this phone before something is wrong with it. The 3 things i love most is battery life and how fast it charges. It has never slowed down .( i guess because it comes with 128gb memory) and the sturdiness of it.The 2 things I was not thrilled about was that it does not take 5G and it does not have head phones port... So i had to buy pods .. But I got used to it and for what I get out of this phone is truly meaninglessness. 3 + years and counting and i have no intentions of switching it.,"July 17, 2022"

I sent the phone to oneplus, and they wanted to charge $200 to have it repaired.  I was very disappointed with the customer service, and the build quality of the phone.

Battery life is good, but not extraordinary, which you would expect with the high refresh screen. The display is buttery smooth. It's very fast. Camera is great. What I liked is that very few phones give the full manual control of camera. The long shutter time definitely helps with astrophotography.

I should've known better than to buy a phone with no warranty... What does it tell you about a company's confidence in their product if they don't offer a warranty?Anyway...I bought this phone because it had been rated relatively high on multiple websites that rank phones, and this was a solid pick in the value category. Regardless of that however, shortly after the Amazon return window closed and for no obvious reason, this phone began to randomly stop sending and receiving text/MMS messages for days at a time, and then occasionally the mic would also randomly stop working while making calls! The problems would always go away after a time, but if a phone doesn't have the ability to call/text when you need it, it's unacceptable...I had thought that OnePlus was a good company, but it turns out that I'm only one of many that have been having similar issues with their phones of late...

1229,OnePlus Nord 2,popoonworld,5,"I was looking for a phone with 5G support, and I was looking for something affordable with a large screen, good camera performance, and built-in stereo speakers, and I found this phone. this was my first OnePlus and I was quite worried, but I was right. I am so glad I came across this one. The battery charger comes with an adapter since it is European spec, but the 65w warp charger charges surprisingly fast. Shooting in night mode is very bright, and shooting video in 4K with the built-in hand stabilizer makes it look like a pro. It didn't come with a music playback app, but I installed the free Pulsar from the google play store. I recommend this app for gapless playback, and it plays Pink Floyd and early Queen albums without boundaries just like records. I could go on and on about what I like about it, but I can honestly say right now that I would choose OnePlus in the future.","April 20, 2022"
1230,OnePlus Nord 2,aislinginjp,2,"I wanted to like this phone. Too bad.Background: I needed to replace my dual SIM Moto G8. Very few made-for-US unlocked phones have dual SIM capacity, and my second SIM is European, so I usually get phones for the EU or South Asian markets. I also wanted 5g, if possible, and a slightly better camera than I had with the Moto. Overall, I was happy with the Moto-- it was a no-frills workhorse--but they had not updated their dual sim line with anything I wanted. I checked reviews, and decided on the OnePlus Nord. So, this is a phone targeted to South Asia being used in the USA. I've never had a major problem with that before.***Two big problems started from the first day out of the box: it does not hold a charge well, and loses internet connection constantly.I don't play games on my phone, and I rarely watch more than 15 minutes of video a day. I do have a lot of apps, but try to limit what's running in the background. Nevertheless, my phone drains from 100% at 8AM to below 40% by nightfall. I often have to recharge it during the day. This started as soon as I got it, and has only become worse over the 6 weeks it has been in use. The past few phones I had took a couple of years for the battery to become this bad.However, the loss of connectivity is the bigger problem for me. I am on TMobile which is a GSM network so that's not the issue. And TMobile 5G & 4G coverage in Boston, where I live & work, is excellent. I have not had a problem with phones losing data connectivity since the early 2000s, but something about this phone takes me straight back to those days. My job requires me to scan documents on my phone and text or email them often, and to track certain types of news. The internet will work for 5 minutes then will drop without me taking a single step in any direction. It drops when I'm outside, when I'm inside, when I'm standing still, when I'm walking, when it's sunny, when it's raining. My internet connection is so unreliable that I now have to carry my IPad as a backup for work. This is annoying.A third problem is that a few times a week the phone spontaneously shuts down. I don't mean that I accidentally hit the wrong button and it turns off-- I mean, out of nowhere, it just decides to power down. Sometimes it reboots, sometimes it doesn't. It was sitting on my coffee table completely untouched last night and it happened again. Take it as an indication of how trying the other problems are that I don't even consider this one of my top issues.I checked the NordPlus support forums for all of these problems, but have found no useful advice. I'm definitely not the only customer having these issues, and that is especially true for the internet connectivity problem-- complaints from all over the world for dropped internet connections.The reason I'm giving it two stars is that the camera is very good for this price point, as is the sound quality for calls and for podcasts. I have not had any trouble running all my apps, beyond the obvious problems with them becoming non-workable without an internet connection. The physical profile is nice.None of this makes up for the problems. Other phones from OnePlus get good reviews. Maybe this model is an anomaly.  This is my first OnePlus phone, and probably my last.","March 22, 2022"

1238,OnePlus 3T 6GBRAM,Jimm,5,"Update: I own both a OP3 and OP3T... and it has been two years since they were released. Both phones have  received OTA updates to Android 8.1 and will receive Android 9 Pie in a few weeks. That is far better support from any Android manufacture and easily better than what Samsung provides to phones that cost more than twice as much! If you can buy a OnePlus phone, do so! You will not be disappointed! When the OP7 comes out, it will have been three years since the OP3 was released. I'll be picking up the OP7 and unlocking it by touching anywhere on the front of the phone.... instead of the back where a sensor does not belong Apple and Samsung!Absolutely amazing phone for the price. It turns on faster and does so much more than an iPhone and costs half of what Apple gets. Other reviewers have listed all of the many great features of this phone. But I want to add a feature that I recently discovered, that is not touted, at all, by this company. I don't know what to call this feature; it is so much more than splash proof, but maybe not completely waterproof. But it is a welcome, if unexpected, feature that I can describe. You can give it a name. My wife and I had been paddling miles and miles of several different springs in central Florida. We spend a lot of time on boats and are comfortable on boats. But we also usually put valuables in dry bags or take other precautions to protect gear like phones and cameras. Our last day, we took an impromptu, short little paddle down a spring; first time the paddle had been open since hurricane Irma. We had been paddling all over Florida, for miles and miles without incident, but sure enough, with our phones in our pockets, we tipped when current pulled the canoe under some freshly cut tree branches (sharp!) My wife's OnePlus was in the water for a couple of minutes. My OnePlus was in the water for 10 minutes or more. We immediately shook the water out of them as best we could. Her phone continued to work normally, but we turned it off until it was dry. Each time we checked it, it just worked!  My OnePlus, however, would not turn off and the display was doing weird stuff that reminded me chemically induced visuals from the 70's. As soon as we could, we wrapped them both in high quality, fluffy towels to dry. I thought my phone would run itself down, as I couldn't turn it off and I was sure it would fry itself in the process. But during the drying process, after a few minutes, it put itself into sleep mode. I could wake it and the screen would come on, as normal, but I couldn't turn it off. After a few hours, I could turn it off with the power switch and it seemed almost normal, even the fingerprint sensor worked. But the ringer side switch wasn't working all of the time. Off to the airport! At the airport, my wife's phone continued to work normally, as did mine: wifi, cell data, camera, and we boarded with the electronic tickets we normally have on our phones. Nice. During the flight home, the side ringer switch started working normally. The only thing not working, now, was one capacitive button (go back button).  I could live with that. I plugged in the Dash charger and lo and behold it was charging, normally. Didn't even get warm. Used my phone as hard as I could during the flight and with data at a layover. Headphones, OTG, file transfers... Everything worked except the one capacitive button. We thanked our lucky stars and got home. The next day, my capactive button started working again. So, 24 hours after going swimming, one for several minutes, both phones were working normally and have continued to do so, since. Thank you OnePlus!","February 28, 2018"
1239,OnePlus 3T 6GBRAM,Sam,5,"The last phone I had was a OnePlus One, and this newer model definitely seems to be less glitchy (but the OnePlus One still works very nicely).The camera is very good, and the front facing camera has also been improved. The screen is also brighter, so I keep the brightness setting very low. You can also set clicks and the lower buttons to do different things which is nice.One thing I dislike is that when holding it, I sometimes accidentally press the very sides of the screen with the hand that is holding it. I'm hoping a phone case will fix this problem.All the listings I've seen on Amazon are more expensive than on the OnePlus site, so unless you have a lot of Amazon gift card money, you might want to go there.","April 21, 2017"
1240,OnePlus 3T 6GBRAM,Jimm,4,"Seller:I bought this phone from NGP STORE USA and everything went really smooth. I was worried of not receiving the USA version (A3000), since many people who bought this phone ended up with the Chinese one (A3013), this seller did a great job regarding that point. The only thing that I can criticize is the price, you can get this phone for $439 directly from the oneplus site (I paid $529).Hardware:- This phone has the same chipset, CPU and GPU that the Google Pixels phones use but paired it with 6GB of ram (the pixels have 4GB). It uses a 3400 mAh battery combined with the a Full HD AMOLED screen gives you great battery life.- The 16MP back camera is really good and I love the flexibility that gives you in manual mode, the laser focus works quite well and the OIS is something that every phone camera should have. I was surprised about the flash, although it is not dual tone it handles fairly good the low light pictures. Bottom line, this camera is excellent but don't expect something outstanding as the Samsung S7 Edge camera.- The front camera has 16MP but is not even close to the rear one (no OIS, no flash, bigger pixel size and more).- The screen is ""only"" FullHD but being AMOLED adds something here. Great view angles, great colors and outstanding contrast.- The audio is excellent! Matching big competitors as the HTC 10.- Other details, the fingerprint sensor is made of ceramic and works incredibly good. The back camera glass is made of sapphire which is super scratch resistance. The metal body gives the phone a premium look and the alert slider on the left side is something that every smartphone should have. No SD card slot, but the dual SIM works like a charm (you can choose which SIM to use for calling, SMS and data). It has a USB type C connector which is nice for the future but right now most cables are just micro USB. The Dash charge is amazing but you need to use the provided cable and charge adapter.Software:The phone came with OxygenOS 4.0.3 which is based in Android Nougat 7.0 and I was able to update it to OxygenOS 4.1 (based on android 7.1.1) using the app Opera VPN and choosing Canada as the location.If you are like me and prefer a more stock android experience you will love OxygenOS, it's light, customizable and secure (encryption is enabled by default).Finally, this device has great third-party developer support, this is a great plus because sooner or later it will lose official support but the third party developers will keep the software updated (think in CyanogenMod A.K.A. LineageOS).Conclusion: This devices is great for money, it's has a top notch hardware and a lightweight software, combining those 2 things you will have 0 lag experience something you won't find in heavily changed android skins (like LG or Samsung).","March 25, 2017"
1241,OnePlus 3T 6GBRAM,Kathleen,1,"I've never once had a refurbish purchase go as badly as this one. Bought the Oneplus 3T and had a great time with it, minus the fact that the screen had very severe burn in. I was willing to look past the burn in for what I thought was a super slick deal I was getting on a refurb. Then, 4 days after purchase, I locked my screen and it never turned back on. You can boot recovery all you want but the display is 100% screwed. As someone who used to repair and refurbish devices, specializing in phones, this kind of refurbish quality is absolute hot garbage. The fact that you can call yourselves a company at all surprises me. Don't ever buy a product from MLG Group. I'm almost certain they pay for good reviews at this point. Any of the bad reviews that I saw would mention the same issues I have, and some of them have returned their phones for a refund, and had never gotten it. I will not be returning the phone, and I will be replacing the parts myself, as to not get completely screwed over by them since they'd keep the phone and probably dodge the refund.DO NOT BUY FROM THE SELLER MLG GROUP.edit: possibly gonna be buried at this point, but I figured it was worth mentioning that I managed to refurb this phone myself at the cost of the extra parts and my own time. The phone continued to last me until I got my next refurb at the end of the 3T support cycle. It would constantly get hot, way hotter than any other 3T's I could compare it to. I assume this could have been something wrong with the refurb I received. My thought on this still stands though, seller sucks for selling phones that don't work, or hardly work until they entirely break. The positive reviews they had I assume were from bot accounts since that plagues Amazon reviews now. Look around for the varied responses, and trust your gut. If everyone says ""product arrived and works"" with 5 stars on it, with no mention of what the product actually was, or any sort of personal anecdotes, don't bother buying it. It's probably junkware trash they're trying to push on you for a quick buck.","July 16, 2019"
1242,OnePlus 3T 6GBRAM,Rodrigo A,5,I used to have a Droid Turbo. I got it when they first came out when I was with Verizon and I took it with me when I left and went to Cricket. That was about 2.5 to 3 years ago. This past November after almost 4 years of use the phone started acting up. Rebooting on it's on. Saying that the battery was low but then when i place it on charger it shows it has like 68% juice. It ran slow and would do all kinds of crazy things. So I started looking at other phones. I looked at the Samsung series of phones Hwiwai's and other Motorola's. I did a search for phones on Amazon and came across the OnePlus series. I started doing my research and found that they had alot of the same features that the Samsungs and all the other High end phones but at half the cost. So I dug deeper. I found some videos on YouTube that compared phones and the only reason that the OnePlus 3t lost out to the Samsung 7 and 8s was camera quality and the other phones are waterproof. I am happy with the price i paid 349.00 as oolpposed to 699+. This phone is awesome. My son wants a Google Pixel. Im thinking of giving him this one and getting the OnePlus 5t for myself,"March 6, 2018"

My provider is TMobile. There was a recent switch in there tower and as of 2 weeks ago I only recent a maximum of 2g service. No data coverage whatsoever. I am using my phone strictly with WiFi. When I called TMobile they said there was nothing they could do. Then I called OnePlus and was told that this is a Chinese model and that it lost functionality at the discretion of TMobile.

1244,OnePlus 3T 6GBRAM,Sam,3,"I had previously been an apple person. I enjoyed my iPhones when I had them, but as my last one started to wear down I decided it was time for an upgrade and had heard good things about OnePlus. When it arived, I was very excited to make the switch to android, and although I've had some issues with it, I still like what android has to offer over apple products. It was fast and sleek (and honestly still is), but I started running into issues with charging. My wife and I have a charger by our bed for both of our phones with two 1 and 2.4 amp usb ports. Both of us had previously had issues with our phones batteries dying prematurely due to using higher amperage chargers. Even though the dash charge box says it goes up to 4 amps, I did not want to risk losing my battery and kept my phone in one of the 1 amp slots (also when charging it over night there's no need to charge it faster). One moring, I woke up to my charging cable being disconnected from my phone. When I picked up my phone, I realized that there was still a peice of the charger left in my charging port. I looked on the internet to see if this had happened to anyone else, and apparently it is a midly common issue. I contacted OnePlus to see if my phone could be reiared under warranty. The customer service rep was super nice, and asked for my order number from their website. I told him that I had bought the phone off amazon and did not have an order number from them, but the ad said the phone came with a 1 year warranty. He apologized and said he could not repair the phone under warranty, but it could be repaired if I paid for it, but could not give me any sort of quote and sait it could take a minimum of about 3 weeks for me to get my phone back. At this point, I had already tried to charge the phone with a different cable and it worked just fine as long as you were careful putting it in. I told him that I would work it out myself. So I looked up how much the part would be and how hard it would be to repair. It was all pretty cheap and looked easy enough, but the part had to come from over seas and would take weeks to ship. I told myself it would be fine and left my phone as it was, and was just very careful when I plugged it in. As more time went on, it started acting up again, and I called a local phone repair shop. They told me that they could not get the part to repair the phone. I tell myself again that it will be fine and move on with my life babying my phone every time it comes near a charger. Finally the other day it breaks. My phone will no longer charge and I have to repair it myself. I love the phone. Even after being a few years old, it still works super well, but im very frustrated the in under a year I've had to repair it with no help from the manufacturer. If anyone is still looking at getting this phone, be warned. It's been awesome, but there are things that can go wrong very quickly.","November 14, 2018"

1298,OnePlus 3T 6GBRAM,Sam,5,"OnePlus have been making a name for themselves over the last few years but this is the first mobile from them I've actually had in my hands.The OnePlus 3T is a lovely looking mobile, it has a premium look and feel to it with a nice 5.5"" screen, fingerprint scanner and decent cameras this can easily go toe-to-toe with the big boys.On the right side of the mobile is the SIM tray (which can hold 2 SIM cards) as well as a power/lock button.  If pressed twice the power button quickly starts the camera.  You can also quick start the camera by drawing an 'O' on the screen, so whichever method you pick you're only ever a few seconds away from capturing the moment.On the bottom is a standard headphone socket, USB Type C charging point and the speaker.On the left is the volume rocker and, in another first for me, an Apple inspired switch to quickly change sound levels to save having to unlock the handset to pop it on silent.Unfortunately there is no micro-SD card slot so I'd recommend going for the 128GB version rather than the 64GB version to ensure you've lots of space available.To make use of the type C charging point you get a Dash Charger in the box.  This claims to rapidly charge up the 3T and in use it lives up to this, instead of the phone taking hours to fully charge you only need to pop it on for 30 minutes to get it ready for the day.  If, before heading out for the evening, you want to give it a quick 10 minute top up you'll see in the review video that gives it around 15% extra charge after just 10 minutes.The 5.5"" screen looks great and is brilliant for games, videos, general browsing, as colours look vibrant and it's very responsive.  Games play really well but the speaker placement means you'll very likely cover it over when playing any games where you hold the phone in landscape mode.The cameras are good, you get decent front and rear facing cameras and the ability to quickly open the camera up is a real bonus.  There are the usual photo and video modes available along with slow motion and time lapse.  The auto focus seemed to be a bit jumpy at times, especially noticeable on some of the slow motion and time lapse captures I've done.The fingerprint scanner is really rapid, you won't even realise you're using it once it's setup, the phone unlocks very quickly.  You'll also set a backup password in case there is a scanner issue and for whenever the phone is powered off/restarted.There are lots of little software enhancements, as previously mentioned you can draw an 'O' to unlock the camera, but there are a number of additional gestural shortcuts such as toggling flashlight, controlling music and taking screenshots.The OnePlus 3T is by no means a budget mobile, but when you consider the price of top end phones it offers incredible value for money.  It has a premium look and feel along with a fantastic set of specs that give you everything you need from a top end mobile.Yes there are little niggles around the auto focus and the speaker placement during gaming, but overall the quality of the mobile, the speed of the charging and the power on offer make this a brilliant all round package.","December 30, 2016"
1299,OnePlus 3T 6GBRAM,Amazon Customer,4,"Buyer beware, you can get this phone for $439 if you buy it directly from OnePlus site.This is the best smarphone of 2016, main differences between oneplus 3 are:- Snapdragon 821 cpu- 3400 mAh battery- Selfie camera bumped to 16MP- Improved electronic image stabilsation for video capture.PROS: All of the above plus:- Dash Charge: Ultra fast charging, fill 60% in 30min.- 6GB of RAM (Why would you need so much ram you ask? you can open a ton of apps and switch between them without delays, besides every mayor smartphone player is going to ship their flagship smartphone with 6GB or 8GB of ram next year, OnePlus was ahead of them)CONS:- No stereo front speakersif you care about sound, you could get the ZTE Axon 7 for $399, it comes with HiFi sound, Snapdragon 820 and 4GB or ram, or the Axon 7 mini ($299).","December 9, 2016"
1300,OnePlus 3T 6GBRAM,Mark J Draper,5,"As daily drivers, I've previously used iPhone 3G through 6S, Samsung S5, various Nokia Windows phones, and most recently, the Google Nexus 6P which I always returned to since its original release... NOT ANYMORE! I love my Oneplus 3T! (purchased directly through the Oneplus Site)The Nexus 6P, Google's own flagship smartphone from 2015, ran 3GB of RAM and a revised Snapdragon 810 SOC. It had a beautiful 1440p Amoled screen and deep front-facing stereo speakers allowed by moving the home button to the rear. It ran stock Android and received updates early and often for a great price (I paid around $549 for a 64GB model)  I was initially afraid of switching to the OnePlus line because although I'd used iPhones exclusively for over six years, I'd grown to love less ""thumb work."" I was also afraid to lose the updates, high-density screen and amazing dual speakers. Would the quad core 821 even be a noticeable bump over the octo core 810? Let me tell you, the 3T has been an amazing upgrade for me.SCREEN: Despite the display being a 1080p panel, it's gorgeous-- if you're unsure, go to a brick and mortar store and check out the  Samsung Galaxy A5-- it  has a similar 1080p 5'5"" AMOLED. I can't really tell unless I hold it directly next to my 6P. Many people don't consider how a lot of web content is still non-HD; it only gets more pixelated on a sharper display. Most important to me is that I can't see individual pixels like I can on the iPhone, so the screen gets a thumbs up!SOUND: The speakers aren't dual-front-facing like my Nexus 6P, but this guy is clear and loud! My headphones still sound great and work well which is important for me-- no silly hardware issues. I thought I'd be demoted to a ""tin can"" speaker after being spoiled by the rare boombox-like 6P, but I'm not disappointed!BODY/POWER: It's got a slightly smaller screen than the Nexus 6P (5.5 instead of 5.7), but the bezels are also a lot smaller, making for a phone that's easy to handle in one hand. I don't even notice that the screen is smaller, and I'm glad my phone fits in my pocket again (did I mention it's lighter weight?). The 16MP selfie camera has all of my Snapchat friends super jealous (despite low-light hiccups common in the industry) . Not a problem for me, but my friends have mentioned accidentally pressing the power button when squeezing the volume because they're on opposite sides of the device. The home button is capacitive so it's easy to press. Via software you can alter the button arrangement (to be like Samsung), add in shortcuts (ie. hold to multi-task, double-tap to show widgets, etc.), or even enable an on-screen digital nav bar if you're into that. In a similar way, you can change the color profiles of the AMOLED panel, and even the color them of the system settings. It's got all the benefits of Android 7 Nougat, and the overclocked 821 paired with 6GB of RAM keeps all-day multitasking smoother than any Android phone I've used which means, like the Apple iPhone, it outperforms the competition in saving you time opening and maintaining apps. I can't wait to see what the next OnePlus device brings!At under $500, the Oneplus 3T is the true Nexus Phone of 2016.ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT?I gave the device five stars despite having a software issue when I received my brand new unit (update corruption). Technical Support helped me, and within 12 hours I was up and running, so that's great! Thanks support!Compared to all the 2016 competition, nothing comes close to the OnePlus 3T in value for money in the U.S. -- it looks, feels, and performs just as well as phones that cost twice as much, and no other phone has this much RAM and can charge this fast. I'd love to have a waterproof device, but I can't justify buying an $800 phone for that feature. Maybe next generation?SHOULD YOU BUY ONE?Be sure it works on your carrier. Tmo and AT&T customers are fine. If you already have a Snapdragon 820 or equivalent SOC phone, I'd pass on the OnePlus 3T. If you've got an 810/older you're not only going to see a speed jump in apps and gaming, but the 6GB of RAM may be more than triple your current! It's got a headphone jack, which the similarly specced HTC U Ultra does not have. I can charge my phone to full in about an hour, and I can't stop gushing over the 16MP selfie shooter <3","March 14, 2017"
1301,OnePlus 3T 6GBRAM,Mark J Draper,3,"I was expecting to receive a super duper phone, the truth is that it is not much better than the Honor  X 5 that it replaced .The cameras are not much better, the battery life is marginally worse than  Honor X 5.It is faster though and has a marginally better screen. The fingerprint sensor is in an awkward position, on the X 5 it was on the back  and much easier to use.I use English, Spanish and Portuguese keyboards, it is painfully slow to switch between keyboards on the 3T , was a lot faster on the X5.I have  had no problems with freezing  or the  3T phone getting bogged down with memory sucking apps but I am careful not to use to many anyway.The phone is OK, a disappointment but OK. I bought it off the One Plus website...","April 22, 2017"
1302,OnePlus 3T 6GBRAM,Raul,5,"I've always been a carrier specific phone guy. Never had any use for, or trust in factory unlocked phones....until now. While the OP3T is a mid-range device (according to some), my personal opinion is, it's without a doubt, the best phone I've ever used, and I've used a bunch of them. Like probably 80% of the population, I don't use a smartphone to it's full potential. I use social media, surf the web, read emails, check the weather, and take a few photos from time to time. I'm not a gamer, and I have no need for a phone that is capable of controlling the international space station. For a guy (or gal) who wants a good solid, and well performing smartphone that won't cause you to have to take out a second mortgage on your house in order to buy it, you can't go wrong with this device. The display is gorgeous, and unless you have microscopes for eyes, you won't be able to tell the difference between the 1080 display, and the 1440 display on a Samsung. The device is very user friendly, with easy to navigate settings. I originally ordered the Huawei Mate 9, and yes, it IS a beast of a phone, but with it, there are settings within settings, within settings, and even sub settings. I monkeyed with that phone for days trying to figure it out, and ultimately sent it back, then ordered this OP3T. I couldn't be happier. It does what I need it to do, and does it flawlessly. If you want a particular phone to enhance your status, or think you need a $1500 phone that shows the world that you have more money than you have sense, then this probably isn't the phone for you. Nothing fancy about it. It's not diamond encrusted, it doesn't double as a drone, it doesn't have all kinds of flashing lights on it, but it DOES make phone calls, it DOES send and receive text messages, it DOES have access to all the popular social media sites, and it DOES have internet access, which all work quite nicely, I might add, with absolutely no lag. In the grand scheme of things, what more do you need?!","February 4, 2017"
1303,OnePlus 3T 6GBRAM,Miles Feral,1,"While the phone hardware has great specs, the OxygenOS leaves much to be desired. While I could live with the minimal customization capabilities, horrible stock ringtone selection, and generally poor performance, I absolutely can't believe they removed the ability to silence the phone using the volume buttons. Due to poor customer service and support practices, they choose to call this a ""feature"" instead of fixing an obvious bug in their code.","January 25, 2017"
1304,OnePlus 3T 6GBRAM,Miles Feral,5,"I love this phone so very much. Without a shadow of a doubt, this is the best phone I've ever owned and certainly the best value out there, in my opinion.The battery life is phenomenal and the dash charging is frankly unbelievable; a few minutes on the charger and you've got hours and hours of power. The only quirk I noticed, after a few weeks with this phone my battery life was completely crippled. I tracked this down to the Google now widget. Disabling that completely resolved my battery issues. Certainly weird, but easy to remedy. I hope anyone who is struggling with battery life problems finds this; I'd hate to see someone gave a negative experience with such a perfect device for such a silly problem.","June 2, 2017"

1307,OnePlus 3T 6GBRAM,Jimm,5,"Just buy it from the OnePlus site. Wait time was shorter than OnePlus estimated at the time of my order. Plus you pay no tax or shipping. The OnePlus 3T picks up where the Nexus left off.  Oxygen OS on Nougat is very light and fast and has useful custom-ability stock Android lacked. No lag or stutters. 1080p is sharp enough and I'm not missing the extra pixels my previous phone (S6 Active) had. Getting almost 7 hours of screen on time. Fingerprint scanner is fast and reliable. Speaker fidelity is great also. Noticeably narrower than the Note 5 or iPhone 7 Plus.

1338,One Plus 5,Turner,5,"I've been using OnePlus phones for years now and I love them. I found out about them back when the OnePlue 2 was coming out, I had just destroyed my new Galaxy (the first one with a curved screen, can't remember the number). An IT guy I knew told me about them and how cheap they were. I wasn't trying to pay Verizon $1000 for a new Galaxy, and the OnePlus 2 was around $300 new. The catch was you needed an invite to buy one. My IT friend worked that out for me and I got the phone, and loved it. I used it for 3 years without issue and still have it sitting in a drawer in my bedroom in case tragedy strikes and I need a phone in a pinch.This phone (actually the 5t, not the 5) is absolutely great. I originally didn't like the fingerprint scanner being moved the back of the phone, but I got used to it pretty quickly. I love that these phone come with basic android and that's it, no bloatware you can't remove. You can then customize them and build them out however you like. I was really impressed with the battery, I can go all day without having to charge. It also comes with the Dash Charger, it will charge the phone completely in around an hour. I'm a big fan of the all-metal body as well, the construction feels very solid.OnePlus phones are generally comparable to Samsung phones in terms of capability and power, but at 1/2 the price. One thing to consider is these phones will only work on a GSM network, so AT&T or T-Mobile are your only options for major carriers in the US. But you can get a cheap month-to-month plan because you brought your own phone, which is pretty nice.5 Stars: great product for amazing price.**Reviewer is a notorious OnePlus fanboy","August 3, 2018"
1339,One Plus 5,Billtech66,5,"I bought this phone because I am sick and tired of the recent trend of smartphone designs such as the notch, or removing the headphones port. This phone is still quite powerful even at almost 2 years old now, has absolutely brilliant battery (100% SOT estimated at 11 hours, mixed usage estimated at 35 hours), and most importantly, still doesn't have a notch, and still has a headphone port. It's sad that so many phone manufacturers feel the need to follow these trends of thinner phones with no bezel to the detriment of both removing useful features and also making ugly design choices like the notch.One negative I would say is the phone is too thin and slippery. You will need a case. But that's nothing compared to how awesome the phone is, even in 2019!","March 23, 2019"
1340,One Plus 5,Turner,4,"It's a great phone that does everything it says it will. Dual SIM works and everything loads quickly. Only problem I have is the front camera really only works well outdoors in excellent light and there's no timer on the camera. The only timer is one that activates after it recognises a face, which is hell to work with.I also wish I could change my lock screen background.HTC allows for do not disturb hours but this won't which sucks because you have to slide a small hard to use notification slide to change whether or not the phone rings.","July 24, 2018"
1341,One Plus 5,Andy Gilleand,5,"Very nice phone, I'm very satisfied with it. Though I want to put it out there that they can come with Android 7.1.1 and the over-the-air update from OnePlus tries to jump all the way to 8.1 and fails to install. To get the changes required to support builds of Android that use project treble, you must stop at 8.0 and then 8.1 and finally 9.0. You can only seem to get these files from their server and you have to scrape an XMP API to figure out what the download link is. I can post details if anyone cares.","April 4, 2019"
1342,One Plus 5,Olivia Russell,1,"12/16/2017 update. I've finally figured out that the phone is defective. Nothing wrong with the settings.There is no tech support, only hard to contact and only by email someone that is trained to mislead, and divert you, waste your time so it's too late to return.I have another phone with the same carrier, a Sony z2 that has the same programs, same set up but works just fine when away from wifi.This OnePlus 5 HAS NEVER USED ANY data. zero data used. Because it's not capable of doing so.Can't contact anyone at OnePlus, and options for tech support is very limited for troubleshooting yourself.prior review:Best battery life of all 9 other phones I've owned.Fast processor, nice shape and size, bright and vivid screen.Best camera for scanning barcodes ever!Dual cameras, one a 20Mg telephoto, the other 16Mg wide angle like all phone cameras.but three problems:1. flash only highlights near and brighter objects.2. Cannot receive pictures through SMS, called MMS. Fails to work, but keeps trying, popping up a warning that not able to, making an irritating sound. No way to see or find out who or where or when it came from. Repeated warnings seemingly randomly throughout the day and night.3. Unable to access internet through mobile phone carrier (I tried two: AT&T and Consumercellular). So, always shows OFFLINE when away from any wifi. Due to missing basic options in SETTINGS.On my OnePlus 5 phone I can find no way to turn on data saver, only can access and turn Mobile data on or off, which makes no difference. I get OFFLINE when wifi is turned off, or when I'm away from any wifi access, basically anywhere, since around here (California) all wifi needs a password.Tech support at OnePlus is not helpful, skirting questions, only offering ""reset the phone to original factory settings before any applications were installed"". However, this has happened on this OnePlus 5 since new, so I see no point in resetting to the same as when I got it when it was happening then as well. There's been no updates to the OS. or system since I got it.I found a possible fix online, which had the same problem but on a different android phone. He says: "" The Data Usage setting for the ‘xx' app was set to restricted.  I removed the restriction and it fixed the problem.""So, I went to  Settings/Apps/data usage/unrestricted data usage (turned on, was off) on DOZENS of applications. (allows unrestricted data access when Data Saver is on)) HOWEVER, still goes into OFFLINE when wifi is turned off... I have no answer, anyone have one?chatting with oneplus tech support, They fail to answer questions, ignoring specific questions, just giving vague path to solutions, and none of them work due to not enough details, and missing options on the phone:F_Bill_WvCSDec 1, 10:45 CST""A hard reset restores the device to the state it was in when it left the factory.“ and it has been doing it since I got it.

I'm wondering if there's anything you can do about them? Perhaps a software update?1. I can't receive any SMS or text message that contains a picture. In fact I don't get any message that contains a picture but get a warning that keeps happening reporting that was not able to receive it. And no idea where it came from or who sent it, or when it was sent. I had to disable notifications.2. There is a problem with the Flash: when taking a picture particularly a close up where there is high contrast. The Flash will highlight the white parts or lighter parts of the picture and the darker parts are even darker. The camera flash increases the contrast too much.Thank you.{THEY RESPONDED WITH: DO A HARD RESET.}","December 6, 2017"
1343,One Plus 5,Kenneth L,3,"Pros-build quality is awesome on this device! I'm very tired of glass-metal sandwiches these days. Charges very fast, but you have to use the included charger for the speed to work. With 8 gigs of RAM, this device will not slow down for a while. Software is very clean.Cons- battery life is horrible. Took out the phone from box at 100%, did a minor setup without even restoring my apps, played a 10 minute video and I was on 68%! Device is still stuck on Android 7.1 when it's supposed to be at 8.1, getting beta for 9.0.  Camera is lackluster in dim lighting even when I turn on the flash.Conclusion- this is my first day of using the phone, so perhaps I'll get an update on the next couple of days, which will hopefully help with the battery life and camera performance.","December 5, 2018"
1344,One Plus 5,Billtech66,5,"I had for over two years and loved it. I chanhed it beacuse I dropped and the screen broke but  it is a great phone, the bettery is great, it is super fast and has great storage capacity","August 3, 2020"
1345,One Plus 5,Billtech66,2,"I got my first OP5 directly from the OnePlus website expecting a Nexus/Pixel style experience based on hype and very bad information provided by tech sites like XDA that seem to be more interested in selling (certain) phones than in providing readers with accurate and useful information.The headphone jack on my OP5 was completely unusable after just 3 months--even the slightest phone movement would result in noise.  A month later the rest of my OP5 stopped working as well.  So after 4 months, my brand new OP5 was already little more than a very expensive paperweight.OnePlus customer service is so bad it's almost surreal.  For three days I couldn't get anybody at OnePlus to even acknowledge that their phone had a manufacturer's warranty.  Different customer service people just kept insisting that the 15 day return period had passed so there was nothing they could do for me.  There was an RMA option on the OnePlus website but it never seemed to be working.  On the fourth day, someone finally admitted that there was, in fact, a warranty and I began the OnePlus RMA process.  This resulted in being without the OP5 for 6 weeks.  The authorized warranty repair center in Texas stated that the motherboard, headphone jack, and USB port were all defective on my phone but rather than sending me a new phone they replaced everything.  Unfortunately, when I finally got the phone back I quickly discovered that the repair center hadn't reconnected the screen properly and there were now flickering vertical green lines running through the display.OnePlus customer service had no interest in repairing my phone after I got it back in an unusable state from their repair center so I filed an insurance claim and paid $150 deductible just so I would actually have a working phone.  I was sent a brand new replacement OP5 the next day.  The headphone jack on the replacement OP5 was defective out of the box--any standard headphone plug would immediately fall out of the jack.In 20+ years of owning various phones, the OP5 is the only one I have ever owned that had a defective motherboard, USB port or headphone jack.  I ended up with two brand new OP5 phones with defective headphone jacks after never previously owning any phone in any price range with that problem.OnePlus cut a lot of corners to get flagship specs into a lower cost phone and the end result is a phone that doesn't feel like a flagship or for that matter a $600 phone.  The OP5 feels like cheap Chinese junk.  The hardware specs are definitely impressive but a $150 Samsung J3 has far superior build quality.Then there's Oxygen which is frequently mischaracterized as being very close to stock Android.  It is true that Oxygen doesn't have a heavy-handed skin like Samsung and Xiaomi phones but Oxygen is only superficially similar to stock Android.  Oxygen is filled with so much code that doesn't meet basic Android standards that there are frequent problems with third-party apps (any app not written specifically for Oxygen).  One month an Oxygen update broke third-party camera apps.  This month an Oxygen update reportedly broke custom launchers.  A popular app can stop working properly after a Play Store update or an Oxygen update.  Oxygen requires never-ending bug fixes since it doesn't conform to Android coding standards.  The OnePlus version of Oreo, for instance, contains a lot of Nougat code that shouldn't be there.  When an app from the Play Store thinks you are running Oreo but your phone is actually running a Frankenstein blend of Oreo and Nougat that is inevitably going to lead to problems which is the reason Oxygen receives bug fixes every month.The OP5 was only on the market for 4 months and making a unified ROM with the 5T appears to be impossible so many developers abandoned the OP5 after Nougat.  Much of the development that's left is artificially sustained by OnePlus.  Developers who want a free OP6 maintain development for the OP5.  But if you follow Telegram, Google+, and tech sites you find that most of the developers still supporting the OP5 don't actually use it.  Even the XDA writer who claimed the OP5 was one of his favorite phones ever stopped using his after the 5T and Pixel 2XL came out.  Unfortunately, most of his readers don't have the same luxury.  And even though that XDA writer praised Oxygen as being like stock Android only better (seriously?) when he dusts off his OP5 it's actually running LOS, not Oxygen.  I wonder why that might be?If you plan to use TWRP and stay encrypted consider yourself warned--OnePlus regularly screws up the decryption keys.  TWRP will be working fine then one day it can't decrypt your data.  You can't simply boot back into the system like on other phones because of the way OnePlus implements encryption.  Your only option is to format the data on your phone which wipes everything and then start over from scratch.  OnePlus has screwed up decryption for TWRP users 3 or 4 times since the fall.Another potentially useful tidbit for flashers that tech writers never seem to mention--Oxygen is so heavily modded that a kernel made for Oxygen will not boot up any other type of Android ROM.  That means custom kernel developers need to make two separate kernels--one for OOS based ROMs and another for Android-based ROMs.  Most DEVs don't want the hassle so there are only a few kernels that can be flashed with non-OOS ROMs and only one where the DEV will actually provide support.Then there's spyware.  Last year a programmer found that Oxygen included a secret data collecting program that users were never told about or allowed to opt out of.  It wasn't harvesting the kind of data that Google, Apple, and Microsoft collects.  OnePlus collected enough data to clone your phone.  When caught OnePlus promised to remove the spyware.  They waited until the next monthly update and instead of removing it changed the name of the spyware program so phone owners wouldn't know what to disable.  When caught again OnePlus finally removed the spyware.Then a program was found on OnePlus phones that allowed anyone with physical access to a OnePlus phone to hack it.  OnePlus claimed it was just a Qualcuum diagnostic program that had been left by accident.  There actually was such a program but Qualcuum said the one found on OnePlus phones wasn't theirs.Then an open beta build for the OP3 was found to have a clipboard app that secretly transmitted data to servers in China.  OnePlus claimed it was an accident, denied that it was spyware anyway and instead characterized the data harvesting as a ""feature"" intended for Chinese customers even though OnePlus sells virtually no phones in China.  There's no point because OnePlus phone designs are copied from Oppo which is a huge phone brand in China.The OP5 is definitely a fast phone.  It's not as smooth as a Pixel but not that far off--as long as you are running Oxygen.  Custom ROMs don't run as quickly or smoothly as Oxygen because they are still stuck using OnePlus firmware with its non-standard coding.  Battery life is generally excellent but a background service can start acting up (especially after an Oxygen update) that causes excessive battery drain.  The only remedy is a complete factory reset of the phone and clean install of apps (not from a Google cloud backup).  I had to factory reset my OP5 more times in 5 months than my Nexus 6P and Pixel XL combined over a period of two and a half years.  The OP5 also charges quickly but uses a proprietary technology called Dash Charge that only works with the official OnePlus cable and charger.  Call quality and Bluetooth audio are both inferior to my outdated Nexus 6P.Because of its poor software, the OP5 takes surprisingly lousy pictures despite having impressive camera hardware.  Many OP5 owners were using the ported Google Pixel camera app instead of the stock camera app.  Since the Oreo update, however, the OP5 needs to be rooted to use the Pixel Camera app because bypassing the non-standard OnePlus camera HALs is currently necessary.I would never consider buying another OnePlus phone.  Unless your primary focus is on hardware specs you can definitely find something better.","March 21, 2018"

Everything works as expected. Sure, it's a refurb and a couple generations behind, but it blows new mid-range phones out of the water for the same price.My only real gripe is that when they say ""generic"" charger, I thought they meant something equivalent to the Oneplus Dash Charger.

1365,One Plus 5,Mr Ed,4,"I am an android geek and an enthusiast for many years. I have rooted phones, written xposed modules and am deeply familiar with android phones. I have moved on, though. All i now want is a good stable, responsive phone. Coming from LG G3, i narrowed my choices to Axon 7, Honor 8 and OnePlus 5 (based on true value). I don't believe there are many other choices.I read numerous reviews on each of these phones, however, i want to decide for myself. Bought all 3 phones and used it as daily driver for a week. I am not gonna bore you with all with processors/technical specs/etc. Phone Arena has those info.Here's my summarized version on usability of the phones.Axon 7Pro:+ Best value for the money among all three phones.+ ZTE is very generous; they don't skimp on anything; Phone comes with everything; including a case, extra set of screen protector.+ Phone is snappy; not many junk Apps; can even disable most of the junk;+ ZTE Custom UI is decent (not great); but customizable+ Dual Sim; but one of slot is either SD card or 2nd sim+ Excellent speaker; although i rarely use it. I always use headphones, so this feature really didn't tip the scale.+ Wifi Calling and VOLTE are available.Con:- Slow fingerprint reader for unlocking the phone. In my opinion, this is a serious flaw since you will be constantly unlocking the phone. Even though you might overlook this flaw initially, it will get to you after some time.- Cellular bands are not wide. Works well with GSM carriers in USA (like TMobile, AT&T etc). Does not work with CDMA. However, if you want to take your phone over seas (asian countries) not all LTE bands are compatible- Among the three, this is the heaviest phone. Also, phone is slightly big to use it in 1 hand.Honor8 (FRD L04):Pro:+ Best looking phone. Phone feels very slippery. I was afraid i might drop the phone.+ Very fast and good finger print reader. Best of all, you can customize few commands in the reader.+ Good customizable UI. Best part is, you can dim the screen for reading, will be easy on your eyes.Con:- This is NOT a dual sim phone. This phone may have a slot to put the second sim. The phone sold in usa does not have dual sim support in OS.- The cellular bands are not wide. Works well with GSM Networks in USA (like TMobile, AT&T, etc). Not with CDMA. However, if you want to take your phone over seas (asian countries), not all LTE bands are compatible- Junk apps- no WiFi calling available.OnePlus 5:Pro:+ Phone is lighter than Axon7+ Broadest Cellular band. Works well with all GSM Carrier in USA; And, if you plan to take it to asian countries, it works well with all GSM carriers there as well.+ Dual Sim; Also, you can dim the screen for reading, will be easy on your eyes+ BEST of all; insanely fast fingerprint reader; The fastest phone, by far. Has the largest RAM, 6GB; fastest processor.+ Closest to the native android experience. Not many bloatwares+ Wifi Calling available; so is VOLTE.Con:- Phone is the same size as Axon7; big for one hand; but much lighter than Axon 7- No SD Card slot- Most expensive of all 3- Compared to ZTE (see Axon 7 above) OnePlus is very cheap. Phone comes with wall charger and a cable, that it. No ear phones, nothing.- Not many UI customization available;- WORST Customer Service. This takes the cake, when it comes to bad customer service.In summary, it all came down to finger print reader. The delay in reading and unlocking the phone will slowly get on your nerves. If you do not care about dual sim (or broadest cellular band), Honor 8 is a good choice. However, if you want dual sim and the fastestfinger print reader, you may have to choose OnePlus 5. I know i will hate OnePlus customer service. I may buy square trade warranty just to avoid talking to OnePlus.","July 2, 2017"
1366,One Plus 5,Gabriel,5,"I would very highly recommend the Oneplus 5 to anyone! I have been and Android user since 2008 until the iPhone 7 plus launched. I switched to the iP7+ in September 2016 mainly because of the camera. I haven't been able to do anything with my phone outside of the standard call, texts, and browsing since because iOS is a garbage OS that can't even properly manage files, the single most basic operation of an operating system.I purchased the Oneplus 5 in hopes that I wouldn't be losing much in the way of hardware quality coming from the iPhone as the one thing Apple does right is the premium build of the iPhone. I checked out the Galaxy S8+ but it feels like a cheap toy compared to the iPhone 7 plus.After a couple of days all I can say about the Oneplus 5 is... WOW. The build quality is at least on par with the iPhone, aside from water proofing. Thanks to Android and of course the Snapdragon 835 + 6GB RAM (I have the 6GB/64GB model) the Oneplus is waaaay faster than my iPhone 7 plus. The screen is much more vivid than the iPhone and can be adjusted to your color preferences. The notification slider is much more useful than the iPhone's simple on/off toggle. The fingerprint reader on the Oneplus 5 is a lot more accurate than the iPhone and so fast that you think theres no way it read your print, but you try another finger and it doesn't come on lol, so it must have.The thing that most amazes me is that I can take much better pictures with the Oneplus 5 than the iPhone 7 plus.. I did not expect that! In both low light and outdoors with the rear and front cameras, my Oneplus 5 is better than my iPhone 7 plus hands down. The portrait mode on the Oneplus also works much better than on the iPhone as it allows for a wider range of distance between you and your subject.Oxygen OS, the default Android version that is preinstalled is wonderful. I anticipated flashing LineageOS or helping port AOSPA to this device but I have to say that I will continue using Oxygen OS becuase it is fast, bloat free and thoughtfully designed.Also, I have not noticed any of the jelly scrolling that other users have pointed out.I don't know where it goes from here, how does a device get any better?","July 27, 2017"

1371,OnePlus 5 A5000,Andrew,5,I did a ton of research when I needed a new phone. I always get unlocked phones to use on any GSM carrier. I am currently using Cricket wireless and I get LTE everywhere. I was coming from an LG G5 RS988 which was a great phone but not with a cracked screen. I needed something with an awesome chipset and a great screen. Not too big though. This for the bill. The front mounted fingerprint scanner and hardware back and recent buttons are what really attracted me to this device. No need to lift the phone to unlock it and more screen real estate without soft nav buttons. This phone is still being updated with security patches from OnePlus and the open beta supports project treble. There's a ton of software development for this phone as well if you want a custom ROM or kernel. I'm running the most current OxygenOs release with a custom kernel and the battery life is amazing!

1374,OnePlus 5 A5000,Kindle Customer,2,"Note I have not used the fingerprint reader or face recognition features to unlock phone. So those are left at 0 stars.I received my Oneplus 5 on the 16th of March. Upon opening it it came with the dash charger plugin, dash charger USB-C cord, sim pin, and a few sponsored ads for low cost cellular data plans. I charged it up from 0% to 100 before using it, and the phone worked fine until the 2nd charge and reboot. After that it suffered from the infamous system freeze ups and reboots and persisted from stock ROM all the way to the official 9.0.4 OTA update, as well as custom AOSP ROMs after unlocking and rooting the phone. The manufacturer site says it is one of the best budget phones for playing games but I cannot even use it to browse the web since it freezes up, screen turns black, which forces me to force reboot it by holding the power button. I waited a month to review to see if it was just the buggy OxygenOS updates Oneplus pushes but it seems it is both that and a dud of a phone as nothing fixes the constant crashing and rebooting. Before I unlocked the bootloader and rooted this phone I went through all the steps Oneplus recommended to fix the issues. Such as flashing the recent official OTA and then clearing all the cache partitions and rebooting but nothing worked. So after that process failed I tried to see if using AOSP custom ROMs would alleviate the problem but it hasn't.Going to the Oneplus forums it appears there are many customers who have the same problem but no real answers on how to fix it from Oneplus themselves, just recommendations to go into the stock recovery, clear the system cache, flash the official OTA update and reboot. I was going to return this phone but it is past its warranty so I guess I am just going to use it until I can order a new phone from a different brand.","April 19, 2019"

1383,OnePlus 5 A5000,Tommie Sanders,5,"I'm honestly so sad I recently broke this phone. I had always used older generations iPhones or other androids and they always got the job done, but sometimes there would be a lot of lagging. The one plus has been the smoothest phone that I've had and I was a big fan of the quickness of the face recognition and the video in video option so I can see two applications at once. The biggest downside was finding a case that didn't mess with the touch screen because the screen is covered. On top of this, their website doesn't offer a case for this phone anymore so I ended up not finding one that works and eventually dropped my phone and broke it. Overall, good product though that's reliable.","September 4, 2020"
1384,SAMSUNG Galaxy A15,Amazon Customer,5,This phone is amazing I got one for my 13 year old and one for my eleven year old and I'm about to buy one for myself! Thus phone is amazingly cheap but it still works well. It has a great camera and a light weight. It is very secure and has a great scratch resistant screen. The picture on the screen was also always clear and easy to see.,"September 1, 2024"
1385,SAMSUNG Galaxy A15,Lisa Cashner,5,"This is a very nice phone. Samsung did a really good job on this one.The build quality is solid. The plastic case is a matte iridescent deep blackish blue and does a good job at not showing fingerprints. The AMOLED screen has good colors and perfect deep blacks. The high capacity battery (5,000mAh) lasts 7-10 days with light usage before needing to recharge. The software is typical Samsung high-quality and the Samsung-built email app is still the best amongst Android phones. The fingerprint reader on the side unlocks the phone instantaneously. The charging port is USB-C. Speed-wise, the phone is plenty fast and doesn't lag. It has 5G cell phone connectivity but you can turn it off and use 4G to save on battery life. Networking also supports 2G (i.e. GSM) that can be turned on or off. Built-in storage is a whopping 128GB. Expansion-wise, the SIM tray accepts 2 SIM cards (i.e. this is indeed a dual-SIM phone), or 1 SIM card + 1 Micro-SD card. There is a headphone jack at the bottom, next to the charging port. The phone is quite big, i.e. the screen is huge, and it's rather heavy but so are most phones nowadays. It barely fits in my pants pockets.This is marketed as an entry-level phone, but honestly, it has such much memory, long battery life, fingerprint unlock, 3 good cameras, dual-SIM, Micro-SD expansion, headphone jack, USB C, great software support, future-proof updates, and is quite fast, so you may wonder why you'd ever need to buy anything more expensive.Overall, great modern phone at a reasonable price ($200) that should work well for most people and last a long time.","April 26, 2024"
1386,SAMSUNG Galaxy A15,Amazon Customer,4,"I bought this for my son and so fat in two weeks he loves it. Battery life is longer than advertised. He charges it every 3 days or so. Loves watching crisp videos and playing video games. Fingerprint sensor works every-time so far. Sound is louder than my iphone 14 pro. Love the option for a wired headphone, there is also the option for bluetooth accessories. Lots of phone cases available for this model. Reason for three starts? Well there is some lag speed with having multiple apps open.","May 27, 2024"
1387,SAMSUNG Galaxy A15,Amazoner,5,"I decided to wait to write a review because I was on the fence about keeping it or not. My previous phone was a Samsung A10E which is not a very heavy phone. The A15 is considerably heavier which I am (still) not very comfortable with. Comparing the 2 phones as far as memory is concerned is markedly different. The A10E has 32 gigs of internal memory. The A15 has 128 gigs of internal memory. Considering that I have alot of pics on my phone with several different albums, this makes the A15 a better product. The battery life is quite good. The appearance is beautiful. I purchased the light blue phone. I have a clear cover on my phone. This is my 4th Samsung cell phone. Samsung never disappoints with quality, durability and performance. I love the Samsung Smart Switch which makes moving your data from one phone to another fast and super easy. They don't provide a SIM card or micro SD card so you need to make sure to move your cards into your new phone. The software is similar to previous Samsung phone with a few tweaks. For example, to get a screen shot for the A15 you need to press both power and volume down button simultaneously. What makes the A15 different from any of my previous Samsungs is with the A15 you have to press each twice. There is a feature that would put a floating icon on your screen and open it and tap screenshot then you will get your screenshot. Now, what sold me on the A15 is a neat feature where, upon your approval, they will block all spam/scam phone calls. So no more annoying spam/scam calls!! It's a neat feature!! Like I said, I love Samsung phones!!","May 19, 2024"

1390,SAMSUNG Galaxy A15,Lisa Cashner,3,"Yes it works, but I have complaints! The touch-screen is the biggest problem, it is unresponsive and inexact. VERY INEXACT. The battery life is pretty good, but not as good as my Moto-G. And it gets really bad call reception in my area if it's not set to wi-fi calling. I do live in a very remote location, but still, what the heck? My old phone worked! My husband's phone works! It's a phone, shouldn't its primary function be making and receiving calls? (Oh, I just betrayed my age, didn't I?)That's all my complaints. Those caveats aside, it has good smartphone functionality and it's sturdy. It is also extremely affordable.I'm afraid I had high expectations. Because they are the premier Android brand, I expected a low-level Samsung to be at least as good as a mid-level Motorola. NO. That is NOT the case. I will be going back to a Moto-G when this phone reaches the end of its usefulness. And I will try to take better care of the next one!","August 21, 2024"

I needed a new phone and being on disability can be a hassle since I am living off of limited income, so thank you Amazon for the automatic payment plan option.

1392,SAMSUNG Galaxy A15,Cindy Kime,5,"For my uses this phone is a great deal.  I use it as a phone, for email, to text, to access the internet, for Zoom, to navigate, to take photos, and a bunch of lesser things like controlling my alarm system and thermometer, reading the Washington Post etc.  What I don’t do is game and social media.The most important things I want in a phone are that it does what I need, which it does, and that it be stable and robust – it’s a Samsung -- nuf said.I had been using a Samsung Galaxy J7 for the past five years but finally decided that it just didn’t have enough memory so I got the A15 which has about 4x more memory and seems perfectly adequate.  Aside from inadequate memory, my old J7 worked perfectly and still does.I see some complaints about the A15 being slow.  It seems fine for my uses, but you’ve probably guessed by now that I’m not exactly a tech expert, power user type.  I can tell you that videos and Zoom operate smoothly.  It may not work very well for high demand functions like gaming, but I wouldn’t know.I opted for the US version for $200 rather than the international version for $20 or $30 less because I didn’t want to mess around with any possible compatibility issues with my isp.  Speaking of cost: for my uses, why would I spend 4 to 6 times more for a high-end phone -- really?The battery seems fine.  I let it charge at night but it so far has never gone below 80% during an average day’s use.  The screen is large and sharp and the cameras seem to do a fine job.  I could only wish that it was smaller and lighter and that it had cordless charging but for the price I’m not complaining.FYI:  The phone weighs 7.57 oz (0.47lbs) and the dimensions are 6 ¼”  x  3”","August 20, 2024"
1393,SAMSUNG Galaxy A15,randall s morris,4,"I got this smartphone as an alternative to a.) Getting my iPhone 12 pro scrubbed.b.) buying another iPhone.To explain, I got hacked while using my iPhone and my bank wanted me to get it scrubbed in case there was some sort of malware on it. So rather than driving 40 minutes and paying $190 to get that done along with the paperwork certifying it was done, I just bought a brand new Samsung A-15 from Amazon. It performs well and satisfied my bank. Price is probably the .ain't factor in my purchasing this phone. I think I owned a Galaxy S-21 before, and I like this A-15 better. It has no water resistance, one speaker, but it has decent cameras and is fast enough loading internet sites. It's a tad big and heavy, but the + side is a larger screen. There is no inductive charging, but it uses a 25 watt charger that makes charging relatively fast. Also, the battery lasts a long time. I think it's 5000 miliamps. I've had it last over 3 days, so that's a plus. If you are an iOS user and have Apple Mail, that can be challenging, but once you set everything up, it's no big deal.","August 20, 2024"

So decided to give the Samsung Galaxy A15 phone a try. I like the build quality of the phone it feels solid and with 5g data and amoled display it's worth the price. It has everything I want in a phone. I don't open a lot of web page tabs so it fast enough for me. It's the four years of Android upgrades that sold me on this phone. My last phone didn't last two years before the battery problem. I hope this phone last long enough to receive all the Android upgrade. The power button is a little hard to press, but the fingerprint sensor works great. I really like this phone and highly recommend this budget phone.","August 7, 2024"

1397,SAMSUNG Galaxy A15,Michael,4,"Great storage, very responsive, sleek-looking Samsung phone. Can run most apps with little to no issues. However, while the Samsung A15 5G is completely ready for RCS and Native Video Calling, it is locked out by default. If you try to contact ATT/T-Mobile/Sprint, they will tell you that only their carrier-branded phones support these features. The current workaround is to use Shizuku+System UI Tuner to enable IMS Settings to turn on Native Video Calling (Samsung/Green Phone app) as well as all the RCS features. It is a shame that these features are turned off by default because we already pay so much money for these phones and data plans, and now they add more restrictions. Very good phone for the price otherwise.","July 10, 2024"

1399,SAMSUNG Galaxy A15,Gary,4,"After being an Apple customer for several years, I am starting to get tired of constantly having to get a new phone at a cost of about $1000 every few years. My phones tend to last longer than the software upgrades allow. I still have a working iPhone 3GS that can be used. I even bought a SIMM conversion kit to test it. It still works, but not much good for anything else but playing my music library.This phone is my delve into the Android world, and at a little over $200 this phone seems to work great. I only did the basic setup, and haven’t logged it into any accounts like Google or Samsung, but I can insert the SIMM card, and use it like an old fashioned phone, should my aging iPhone 8 fail on me. Right now, I am trying to decide about whether to shell out for another Apple product or just go with Samsung, like a lot of others have done, according to recent news about how Apple is losing market share to Samsung.After I get a chance to play around with the phone a little more, I will probably update this review.","May 17, 2024"

1401,SAMSUNG Galaxy A15,Geodenizen,2,"I always need a backup phone. My main phone ( Moto stylus 5g) dropped and had to order a new screen. My backup phone died so, I bought this Galaxy A15 since it would get to me the next day. I thought getting a Galaxy would be great with the brand reputation. I realize this is entry level for this family of phones, but did expect a little better. Here is the good:1. The Samsung UI is intuitive and is willing to take on tasks and minimize effort for logging in and anything related to accounts.2. Setup was easy with the Samsung UI.The not so good:1. It has to think about loading something when you try to open an app. I was able to grab my laptop log in and start typing before it loaded the app.2. It will say you are offline even when connected to WiFi or cell. You may have to close then relaunch the browser multiple times for it to load.3. the UI gives you a message that you will have to reboot the phone often to keep it working correctly. I know a little about computers and know that the file system will apply updates and such to ensure it is working right however, I found I had to reboot this one multiple times in a day to get it to open apps or connect. There were no error messages or indications of hardware issues. It was new in the box.4. I bought a Moto G 5G as a backup, which is in the same price range as the A15 and it; setup, connected and navigated apps without issues or delays. The performance difference was notable.I have read many reviews with the same result from users regarding the A15.I was able to install the new screen for my Stylus G, while it is slightly higher level than the A15, it hadno issues with speed or connectivity the same as the Moto G 5G.Summary:  The A15 performs lower than comparable phones so, if you are looking for a low mid range phone, other than a dedicated Samsung fan, it would benefit you to either upgrade to a higher level Galaxy or shop for a different brand in this price range.Hope this helps.","September 2, 2024"

The soundcard is good,  which is what I care about and why I went back to Samsung.After testing , it can't use Google's speed test and had a problem scrolling one of my emails; other speed tests and emails worked.  This occurred on multiple browsers.  My old Samsung phones used google's test and scrolled the same email without problem as usual.

For a secondary/budget phone, this is a great deal (I got it for $170).My primary is an A54 and I would recommend that over this phone.  BUT... if you do decide to get the A15, understand that it is a budget phone that can do all the basic things you need.Overall, for the price, it does have many features that are attractive.  I would get a 128gb micro SD card that's A1, V30, and U1.  It'll be decent for apps.Edit: I wanted to mention that this DOES work with T-Mobile.  If you want to check compatibility, go to your phone carrier and see if you can purchase the phone through them.  If you can't, then that means the A15 is not supported.","March 17, 2024"

1408,SAMSUNG Galaxy A15,Stuart Strausbaugh,2,"I bought the Samsung Galaxy, the description said unlocked. And compatible with my carrier which was MetroPCS. When I got the phone and try to activate it my carrier MetroPCS said it was locked by another carrier and wanted a $30 fee to unlock it. Or to call Amazon to see if they could call the carrier that it was locked by and have them unlock it. I had no success with that. So I returned the phone. I then but another Samsung phone of the same model, with the same description as being unlocked from Amazon. I bought a second replacement phone and that phone was also locked by another carrier. And a $30 fee was required to unlock it by my carrier. So both phones were locked when I bought them. If I would have been told that there was to be a unlock fee from my carrier in the first place I would have kept the first phone and just paid to have it unlocked. Not knowing this information from Amazon, and a incorrect description of phone and misinformation, cost me time and money for almost a month, waiting on a return of my money and in the meantime I had no phone. So phones that say unlocked are almost definitely locked. And a fee from your carrier will be needed to unlock it. And paid by the buyer. The phone I bought as a replacement after sending the first locked phone back was also locked. I ended up buying the same model Galaxy phone at a higher price , I also had to pay for unlock fee. The ram was lower, 4 gigs vs 6 gigs than the original one I purchased. So because of misinformation and bad description, the overall situation of the purchase was very very bad. The Galaxy phone itself seemed to be running fine so far. But because of low ram at 4 GB, it seems to lag when scrolling.","August 30, 2024"
1409,SAMSUNG Galaxy A15,DK,3,"After having the Samsung galaxy A15 5g for over 6 months now I can say it's not a bad deal for under 200 bucks. The performance on it has been slower over the months, but nothing too bad yet. It has 128 gb of internal storage, which for me is plenty. The sound quality on the speaker isn't anything amazing, but it works well. Although I do hate the placement of it at the bottom of the phone, it gets covered easily and muffles the sound. The picture quality is pretty, way better than my last phone. The thing I probably love about it the most is the display. I didn't think I would care that much about the display, but every time I look at someone else's phone I only then realize how much of a difference it makes. All in all if your looking for a reliable phone under 200, this is probably the best deal.","July 18, 2024"
1410,SAMSUNG Galaxy A15,Michael Hmel,3,"Very similar to older Samsung but was set up to only take three icons in width.  Could not find setting to change so set it up similar to older phone.  After about a week contacted Samsung about it and received a call back.  After resetting to factory settings I could change the display to 4 or 5 wide.  Then able to set up icons and widgets to give the desired spacing.  I then had to reload all my apps and go through all the settings again.All the other issues I have had have been with the changes from older software to the latest versions, not with the phone itself.  Samsung did add extraneous apps, some of which could not be deleted so I did a force stop on them.  The first update brought them back so had to turn off automatic updates, then allow or block updates individually since then.Would prefer to have the 256 gig memory of the non-US veersion but did not want to give up the warranty.

1419,SAMSUNG Galaxy A15,KP,2,"I bought this phone because of all the good reviews and that it was affordable.  I had had bad experiences with Samsung phones in the past, but I thought maybe they had improved.  I was disappointed.Within a couple of days, when I was trying to type out texts, I found that even if I very carefully pushed on a letter that I wanted, another letter, or number, or word would show up in the text box.  I would have to re-start the phone to get it to work again.  And that was not all.  Other times the screen would start jittering badly, or quickly shifting back and forth between two apps when I wasn't even touching it.This behavior has persisted.  Due to this problem, I have to re-start the phone on the average every two days, but there have been a few times whey I've had to do it three or four times in one day.Also, I'm not sure why the default setting for the screen is ""gestures"".  This was very frustrating because I could only remember a few basic gestures, so I could never do things like bring up the screen with all of the open apps, as well as having other things happen that I didn't want to happen when I tried certain swipe gestures. I finally got sick of this problem, and looked it up on the internet and found where there was a way to get three buttons at the bottom of the screen - one for ""back a screen"", one for the ""home"" screen"" and one to open the window allowing you to scroll through (and close) open apps individually - or close them all with one button.The battery saving feature takes a while to get it right.  This feature keeps you from over-charging it, and stops the charging when the battery gets to 85% full.  For the first few weeks, this resulted in me sometimes running out of power before my day was through.  This feature has some king of AI support, I think, and it has gotten better over time.  It still says it only gets 85% full, but it usually lasts a whole day unless I am using it very heavily.Otherwise, the phone seems to work well, but the screen problem is bad enough that I can only give this a two star rating.","May 10, 2024"

The A15 5G met all her requirements and more, even has a earphone jack and micro sd card for external storage - which the S23FE does not. Has the same Android 14 as my S23FE. File and app transfer from the old Galaxy to to A15 was smooth. Fast charge battery is very good via USB connection (no wireless charge). The phone is fast and responsive.

Samsung sent me to their repair store, and since they couldn't duplicate it at the time, they told me there was nothing they could do. They also said they did not have any parts on hand and had no idea how long it would take to fix anything they did find wrong. They told me that I need to use someone else's phone and videotape the problem when it's happening, then show it to Samsung.

Had to redo my fingerprint just for that to not work really either...- Not sure if it's my phone carrier, but literally cannot text in a group chat if there's more than 10 people...- Color isn't what it says to me. It's supposed to be a cute, reflective blue and it doesn't even look blue in the slightest, but not too mad about it. Just a little disappointed.- Just my slight with Samsung phones, but I hate the voicemail setup. I much prefer Apple or Google's way of reviewing individual voicemails along with the day they were sent instead of having to listen through all of the menu options and voicemails with no way to tell when they were sent..Overall:I'm not sure I'd recommend this phone, at least not for $200. I tried out the Moto power 5g 2023 and I actually preferred it over this phone. While it was taller, it was slimmer and easier to hold. Faster too, just had too much bull crap on their crowding up the phone and home page. I regret buying this one and keeping it, cause I can't return it since it's past the return date.","May 17, 2024"

1449,SAMSUNG Galaxy A15,KassT,2,"Over the first few weeks of buying the Galaxy A15 5G, I became aware my phone would not ring or vibrate when three family members on my Favorites list called. The phone worked fine with other family members and friends on my Favorite list. All settings were the same. I called my carrier and it was not their problem. I then called Samsung support. I spent 65 minutes trying to translate a heavy East Asian accent. To make matters worse, he shared a room with, I'm guessing, 10 - 25 people. Between the accent and the talking in the background, it was very difficult to understand each other on both ends. I was asked at least four times the reason I was calling. Duh. At the end of our conversation it was left up to me to use the phone and see if the problem was resolved, and if not, to call back. Huh!? The solution? I have to keep both the Do Not Disturb and the Sleep features turned off in order for the phone to ring for those three people!!!  There might be more people who haven't called me during this first month that won't get through when they call. That remains to be seen over time. I'm two days past the Amazon refund date. My bad. There's a zero chance of my every buying or recommending ANY Samsung product going forward. You're welcome, Samsung, for my $176.00 donation to your bottom line.","April 18, 2024"

First, the fingerprint feature doesn't work at all well.  I have supplied a new fingerprint half a dozen times and it just won't open the phone.  Another very disappointing thing is that the tweaking software made for Galaxy phones, Good Lock, is not available on the Galaxy store.  The substitute version, Fine Lock, is available on Google Play but the app is empty of modules.  A search online suggests that this phone is too low end for Samsung to include access to this app.  Ugh.  I am no expert on cell phones, but my last phone, a TCL, worked much better than this new Samsung.  The TCL had voicemails available without having to log into a voicemail center to retrieve them.  There are other dislikes I have but you get the picture.  If these issues are due to pilot error, I am glad to edit the review, but so far...disappointing.","May 19, 2024"

1484,SAMSUNG Galaxy A35,RT,5,"I've had my Samsung Galaxy A35 for just over one month. I looked at a lot of reviews before pulling the trigger and I shopped a few brands.1st - 4 Android upgrades (1/yr) and 5 years of security patches CAN'T BE BEAT at this price point.2nd - IP67 dust/water resistant (up to 1m for 30 min).Great screen (Super AMOLED, 120Hz, 1000 nits) and the adaptive brightness works super well (High Brightness Mode). Solid build with Victus Glass front and rear on a plastic frame. 5000 mAh battery and 25W charging give longevity and fast top ups. The 5nm Exynos 1380 chipset has 4x2.4 GHz & 4x2.0 GHz processors along with 6GB RAM, 128GB internal storage and micro SDXC slot. Plenty of power and storage under the hood for all except maybe the hardcore power users and game junkies. A fantastic all-around phone for most users. Fingerprint reader under the screen works great providing accurate and fast access to the device. Stereo speakers have plenty of volume and a pleasing tone for streaming videos. Audiophiles will want quality ear buds regardless of the speakers. The sound is well tuned for normal use. Calls are clear and trouble free.I don't really do selfies; the front camera is 13MP of acceptable. Not horrible, not wow.Let's talk triple rear cameras. 50 MP, f/1.8, (wide) with PDAF (phase detection auto focus) and OIS (optical image stabilization - way better then electronic image stabilization) + 8 MP, f/2.2 (ultrawide) + 5 MP, f/2.4, (macro). Like their displays, Samsung also makes their own camera sensors and know what they are about in both departments. In my experience, the biggest limiter on phone cameras is the controlling software. Here Samsung gives you acceptable level software. No brand name glass (like Zeiss or Leica) for the lenses. The cameras are solidly utilitarian and get the job done with enough power to give you some creative wiggle room. Those who know how can tweak their pictures by learning the strengths and weaknesses and going to post processing when needed. Unfortunately, there is no RAW support, or you could make even better progress in post. There are also several shooting modes that users might utilize to adapt to the composition of a particular image capture.The main camera operates in a 12.5MP mode by default. I went into settings > settings to keep > camera mode (switch on) so that it remembers I want the 50MP mode and saves it when I open the camera app again. There is no zoom in 50MP mode, but I'd rather crop in on more pixels than use less pixels getting degraded by digital zoom in most use case scenarios.The picture of the steering wheel detail was taken with the 5MP f/2.4 macro lens, auto settings, no post process.The two cloudscapes were captured with the main camera in 50MP mode, auto settings, no post process. You only achieve 50MP when shooting in full aspect ratio. I prefer 16:9 so those images are 37.5MP.The picture of the moon was taken in Pro mode (12.5MP) with 10x zoom, ISO 40 and -2.0ev.The picture of the $1 coin was captured with the main camera at 50MP. I used a 10x macro lens clipped in front of the main camera and did post processing in Snapseed.The picture of the moth was captured with the main camera at 12.5MP and 2x zoom. Post processed in Snapseed.All-in-all: solid value for money and a phone you likely won't upgrade from anytime soon. It has all you need to make it a faithful companion for years.Quick Update: I was out taking Milkyway photos the other night with my mirrorless camera. I did add one image to this review, taken with the A35. The photo of the trees after sunset was during the Blue Hour (low light) with the main camera in 50MP mode, auto settings, lightly edited in Snapseed. The capture was at 1/9th of a second and demonstrates the effectiveness of the Optical Image Stabilization.I was also using the Stellarium app with live view and can attest to the accuracy and responsiveness of the compass sensor on the Galaxy A35. I just keep finding more reasons to love this phone!","July 1, 2024"

1488,SAMSUNG Galaxy A35,Lavienrose30,5,"UPDATED POST (30JUN24)For some reason, the phone is very ""slippery"" when placed glass-side down.  I have set the phone face down on surfaces like a kitchen or restaurant table with and without cloth and plastic table cloths, my pant leg when I am sitting down, the keyboard  and top of my laptop when it is turned off or closed, and other materials.When placed this way, if there is ANY slight sense of not being 100% level and flat, the phone will start to creep in the direction of the slant and make it way off of the device.  This is very annoying and concerning that it may sustain damage...especially since the frame and corners are plastic.My only solution it to put it face up (yet camera side down) where is seems to create a bit more friction and not creep off of the surface.  When trying to maintain privacy, I although I WANT to place it face down, I am fearful it will slide off of the surface.SOLUTION: Getting a thin silicone skin-type case for it has solved my issue.Note: Although I say ""I"" above, it is a combination of either me or my wife, as the phone is now hers, but I use it from time to time.ORIGINAL POST :I bought this for my wife. I have a newer Samsung S-series.This phone has everything I would want.I would gladly trade my S-series for it.What it is missing, compared to my S-Series:1) Wireless charging  If I really needed that I could get this for $10  (See end of this review for Amazon  TASUMATO Wireless Charging Receiver Qi Charger Adapter link)2) Thinness A35 is thicker (0.32"" vs 0.30"")3) Maybe speed? (Not noticeable enough for me)4) Too new for Verizon to recognize5) Read ""complaints"" about speed of fingerprint reader.  To me it is not significant.6) Size  A35 is taller (6.37"" vs 5.76""  )/wider( 3.07""vs 2.79"" ) ,  I like the smaller S-Series because so it does not stick out of  my back pocket like the A35.What is has that I wish my S-Series had1) Micro SD Slot2) Less that 1/2 the price.3) Battery almost 2x as big4) Android 14 is its first OS. Which means it will be supported longer than my S-Series (release with Android 13)  with another Android O/S update.Since this is an Unlocked version, Verizon doesn't sell a similar version (even a Verizon locked version) yet, and it has only been out since Mar/APRIL 2024, I had an issue with Verizon.The only issue I had was getting a physical 5G nano SIM installed for it from the local Verizon store.I used the old Verizon 3G SIM I had (from the phone I was replacing) in this new phone until I could get to the verizon store. No issues.When the Verizon ""tech"" tried to scan the phone, it would not come up in his database. Thus he couldn't link it to the new SIM in an automated way (and he did not know how else to do it).He said ""We usually have this issue with Unlocked phones.""I think it was just because it was so new.So, he set it up via eSIM.  He did some testing and found no issues.I ran it this way for a while without issue.I also got him to give me a new blank Verizon 5G SIM. (It was no good to me unless Verizon registered it anyway).I called Verizon customer support. Since I had a blank Verizon 5G SIM, they were able to void the eSIM and get my 5G physical SIM to work over the phone.So, no real ""issues"" with Verizon, just an inconvenience.NOTE:I did not set it up with face recognition or the fingerprint reader for security reasons.WIRELESS CHARGING RECEIVER ADAPTER from AMAZON:https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Charging-Receiver-Charger-Adapter/dp/B09T9192P1/ref=sr_1_7?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.XikiZ2djR8Rm8GopWoXVrA6AtYSRHayCogLn1kB5WU1S1MxZpSygtHxk2SoP8HhoTmeYF_C9UDcXTJbQfQvHkiFALl_olKSl3jH1Kr2lBa2mHnkXagvaC0d1QDHVq2ia76qe0msNIOLPW8CEfpderibezU531235JojJLrHVl0ezvGYDTYPDr9cO3-X6l09LEsoaOhkw0GzjX5EsJIKh71KnLblw7KQ1dHYPBzj199A.YtasrLm4IwzJ-ZHKuwzoNLE3v11As-gdgSzdTnxyzf4&dib_tag=se&keywords=wireless+charging+adapter&qid=1717338850&sr=8-7","June 2, 2024"

1491,SAMSUNG Galaxy A35,James Bond,5,Reviewers price the phone as mid-range in the $700 range. Bought it for song. I bought it for the gigabyte RAM and the camera. A little heavier than I expected but I'll easily get used to it.,"September 3, 2024"
1492,SAMSUNG Galaxy A35,Hank,5,"Coming from a Note 9 that is 5 years old I find that even though it doesn't have wireless charging and an S pen that this is a great replacement for said phone. Although I suppose upgrading from any phone that is 5 years old to one that is less than a year old would probably result in a good experience one does have to make sure to get a phone that will meet your needs. I watched multiple reviews online and read ones as well and decided that I don't really need wireless charging or an S pen for the price one has to pay to get phones with those features. Ordered a set of magnetic adapters for the cable which will make connecting and disconnecting the phone to charge much easier than having to insert it. This should help to over come the ease of wireless charging and wired charging is faster anyway even if not as convenient. The one thing that most reviews failed to mention, and perhaps it is because it has become so common on Samsung phones, is adaptive charging. This ability allows one to pick from 3 different behaviors the phone will have in relation to charging when left on the charger which is significant for over night charging. This is a feature which my old phone did not have. Based on what I researched online the worst thing you can do to shorten your battery life is leave your phone on the charger overnight if it does not have adaptive charging. When I had my note 4 I did not know this and use to leave it on the charger overnight all the time. Although with the Note 4 you could just replace the battery when it went bad by just removing it. I followed the advice of not leaving the phone on the charger overnight with my Note 9 and I guess it must have extended the life of the battery considering it has not swollen in 5 years of use. Even if it does not hold the charge as long as I would like. As far as speed I find this phone to be plenty fast for doing everyday things which is all I really want the phone for besides playing some low end games. The front finger print reader is fast enough for me, coming from a phone with the reader on the back, and has no problem unlocking my banking app as well as the password software I use. I had read that someone else couldn't use the front reader with their banking app so this was of concern for me. Have no problem using it with Mint, which uses T-Mobile towers, simply shut down phone installed sim card and SD card rebooted and was making phone calls in no time.  For me this works great as a replacement for my Note 9 and should get plenty of years of use out of it.","July 20, 2024"
1493,SAMSUNG Galaxy A35,Amy,5,"Frankly, I never had any problem.well, not much anyway with my previous Moto G5. And then, though the Moto was still dandy...but getting a bit long in the tooth I wisely purchased the not inexpensive SAMSUNG Galaxy A35 5G A Series Cell Phone, 128GB. Yes, it's cheaper than one of those fruit fones but it still ain't cheap. Long story short a couple of months down the line....It was a HUGE step up. Of course I'm still discovering helpful features. I love this thing. Bigly. Gets my highest recommend! One tip I will give. If you use the voice thingy to, say, do your messages, look on the webbernet to see how to change over to the Google voice. The phone defaults to the Samsung voice...and that thing just never graduated elementary school. Get goog voice to text for happy! Happy phoning!","August 30, 2024"

This phone may not be the best at everything, but it does everything that I use it for to near perfection. Have no regrets after purchasing the phone approximately a month ago. The phone seem a bit on the bulky side and slightly heavier like other reviewers had mentioned, but it is not a major issue with my needs and purposes.Last, but not least, longevity of the battery is fantastic when your not playing games or streaming movies on it.","August 30, 2024"

I held onto an old Motorola that I got from TMobile in 2019!I finally upgraded to this Galaxy and love it. I synced my phone and tablet for easy transition and fluid use.I like the fingerprint security feature, the appearance, and long-lasting battery. The only issue I have is with the camera and video. Like many mobile devices, distance shooting is pixilated. That's why I still use a 40x zoom camera.","August 13, 2024"
1499,SAMSUNG Galaxy A35,Eric S,5,"Purchased this phone for the gorella glass front and back, sd card slot, large battery, 4 OS upgrades and 5 years of security updates, and the duel sim capability. I'm not a gammer and don't want to pay for all that high speed stuff. Needed a basic rugged phone that will last me 5 years or more. I use security system apps, email, text, and internet with some camera use, but no great expectations on the camera. Does everything I need at a price point below what I thought I would pay. Only drawback is the phone is somewhat larger than anticipated and a little heavier. Not a big deal though. Connected to the Verizon network through it's internal SIM without any issues. 25W fast charge works well and takes about 1 hr, 20 min for a full charge from 5% using a samsung 40W wall charger (purchased separately).","July 25, 2024"

1508,SAMSUNG Galaxy A35,CaptM8,3,"I bought this phone because after 3 years, my A32 needed daily recharge with moderate use. With this new phone, I barely get through the day. And that with some power saving settings. I probably going to keep this phone because of the hassle of trying something else  but disappointing is an understatement.Two other less important flaws: While the cam makes slightly sharper low light pictures than my A 32 did, don't try to make a pic of moon light landscape, it will have strong red bias.The application screen has only the first word of the app description, other than my old A 32 - what did they think.On the plus side :  Significant increase in memory capacity. Good audio quality both incoming and outgoing, nice sensitive screen. And as with all Samsung phones, you will get several OS updates.Bottom line :  If long battery life is important to you, look for something else. Otherwise it's a decent phone.","August 25, 2024"

I'd like both and as my last phone had a battery share feature that was ridiculous as it needs charged all the time, you would think technology would improve.

Not sure if it's Amazon or the seller's settings.Phone issues from day one - Intermittent screen freeze, app freeze, back up freeze, wont acknowledge touch commands and it overheats. I have done reboot MANY times, reset network, factory reset, manually set up with bare minimum info, nothing helped.Per usual routine when buying a Prime item shipped from Amazon I just wanted to exchange this phone that was defective upon arrival for the same phone but it was not an option. You have to wait for a refund that could take up to 30 days.If you have plenty of money and can wait great! But I had no option but to finance through Affirm. This shouldn't have been an issue if exchanging but not being allowed to and HAVING to wait for a refund locked up the funds I desperately needed to buy a functioning phone.

I saw Tracfone sold the same A35 model but they could not activate this unlocked IMEI with a physical SIM that I had to buy or with the eSIM feature.  I gave up and decided I would change carriers and went to Mint Mobile next.  Mint has a somewhat deceiving compatibility check and initially showed it was compatible with their bands.  However, there is a tiny question mark to click on which shows it is not compatible with Mints 5G bands.  I'm not buying a new 5G phone just to have it at 4G so I returned it.What puzzles me is, last year I bought an unlocked US version A54 and it activates and works at 5G on both Tracfone and Mint.  The A35 has the same chipsets as the A54 but doesn't support the common US carrier bands.  I don't think this was a US version but I am not sure.","August 3, 2024"

1561,SAMSUNG Galaxy A35,Jan,1,"This phone is slow. Going from app to app is slow. Looking through the background apps is slow. Typing is slow - there letters on the screen are a bit behind, even when not trying to type fast. There seem to be lots of phantom touches. For example if you open a site in a browser it will start going to a hyperlink on the site before the whole page loads. Which happens SLOW even with a fast, and strong connection. The phone is supposed to have a glass back, but it feels cheap and theres flex that usually would not have with a higher end glass device. The boxy shape of the phone makes it feel bigger than it is. And its oddly heavy.  Oneplus 12r would be a better option just based on software and the speed. But with the Oneplus curved screen you have to deal with all those accidental touches. But the A35 has ghost touches while the Oneplus tends to respond faster once you try to go back.

1574,SAMSUNG Galaxy A35,RT,5,"I've owned this phone for about a month or so now. Coming from a Galaxy S8, this phone feels incredible to use in comparison. Disappointed that it didn't have a headphone jack, but I don't want to purchase an A05 just for the headphone jack since it's a lower-end phone. The A35 is the perfect sweet spot when it comes to smartphones that just work. Expandable storage with a microSD card is a nice touch. I'm also really happy it doesn't have any of Samsung's new AI stuff. It runs almost all apps with little to no issues. it doesn't run higher end mobile games like CoD Mobile or Zenless Zone Zero, but things like Subway Surfers and Jetpack Joyride run perfectly fine. Battery life is excellent, I can get 1-2 days out of a single charge depending on my usage. Videos, TV shows, and other content look really good on this phone since it's got an OLED screen. All in all, a very decent phone for the price. Hard not to recommend.","August 3, 2024"

I also bit the bullet and switched to a new mobile service provider at the same time when I activated the phone (it was easy and I was able to keep the same cellphone number). I had no problem doing this because the phone is ""unlocked"". As soon as I finished setting up the phone I saw that all my contacts, apps, photos, files, etc. transferred without a single hitch from my old Samsung Galaxy S8+.  The display is nice and big and the resolution and colors are very sharp and brilliant. The sound quality is truly awesome as well. I noticed right away that it was much better than my last phone when I listened to some music (I'm a professional trumpet player and I prefer listening to music genres that include Jazz, Classical, Folk and British Brass Bands). I would definitely recommend this product.","August 27, 2024"

Samsung software is pretty good.HOWEVER, this and other S24 models have serious issues with OLED ""grain"". This appears as uneven grey colors at low brightness. It's super distracting if you use dark mode. It's one of those things that, once you notice it, you will see it forever. My first unit had terrible grain, so I returned it and got another one. The second one is perfectly fine, and I love it. Just be aware of it if you are sensitive to display issues.","July 30, 2024"

Every was easy to set up due to the smart switch app.My only issue was getting the service turned on since the sim card in the S9+ was originally from my S6+. Turned out that it was necessary to download an e-sim. But I'm pretty that was a service provider issue, not so much a phone issue. (I use straight talk).","July 31, 2024"

It has awesome battery life and for the most part everything seems to work the way it should. However it has the worst fingerprint recognition scanner of any phone I've used. I'm having to enter the code about half of the time, and yes I've deleted the fingerprint imprint and redone it several times to the same effect.Also, even though I downloaded the UI update and installed it, it constantly says there's an update, tries to download it, halfway through it clears out the Wi-Fi password and pauses the install.  The smart transfer feature did not transfer password and logins to all of my various apps, even though another phone I got at the same time... A free phone from straight talk, copied everything perfectly.I'm sure these are all issues I will eventually overcome... But when I pay several hundred dollars for a phone, I expect it to be easier and work better.I also don't understand why they don't include an option to add an SD card.","August 31, 2024"

1606,SAMSUNG Galaxy S24,Logan,3,"The product looked good when delivered and I didn't notice the touchscreen problems until the next day after I downloaded everything to the phone. I have no screen protector that could be interfering with it. I am considering deleting everything and returning it but that is a lot of hassle. I had a very slow phone, which I used for years before this, so it's still an improvement. For $800  I would expect a phone that works as good as new. The other thing is the talk to text. Definitely.Adds periods and punctuation where it does not belong I end up having to correct a lot of what is said I left the last few sentences uncorrected, so you could see. Battery life, was good the first week And it might be the apps that I added that are sucking up the battery. I would say it's definitely the apps that are  running in the background. So I would say, overall, a good phone, but I wish the companies would test functionality a little more thoroughly, because the touchscreen is the most irritating thing to have to push on something six times to get it to respond.

1611,SAMSUNG Galaxy S24,S M P,3,"Buying Samsung products is not inexpensive. With cell phones, however, one expects quality - especially as pricey as their phones are.My pro: the phone feels sturdy and comfortable in hand.My Cons:  1.  The secondary sim is an e-sim, which is not accommodated by all cell service providers.  2.  Most user choices are removed with this phone and unable to be changed in settings. Example - If you use an eSim with a physical sim, the physical sim settings are primary OVER eSim settings. This is even when the eSim is designated as the primary sim. All eSim settings are treated as secondary.  3.  Google accounts on the phone cannot be selected as primary or secondary. The phone forces the selection on users whether or not you want them that way. Example - I have a personal (for purposes of android) and work based email that each use Google. The physical sim attached to my work email / account is treated as primary OVER my personal account. Well, geez, it's my phone that I spent an enormous amount of money on.  4.  While different ringtones and notification settings are selected for each sim, AGAIN, they settings for the physical sim supersede those for the eSim.  5.  Many apps on your phone will default to the Samsung selected settings are unable to be changed.  6.  Privacy controls are NOT user editable.  Most privacy issues must be waved for use of the phone.There are many more gripes or dislikes about this phone. Bottom line, user control or preferences are removed. Further, if you use this phone to travel, wherein most users may opt to use a physical sim purchased in the respective country of travel, then expect that all settings for that physical sim will override ANY setting used for the eSim, EVEN WHEN the eSim is selected as primary.  NOT OKAY!!Samsung has already removed so many standard features from their phones such as the sd card, earphone jacks, and other things.  This is all done (seemingly) to compete with Apple.  What Samsung hasn't grasped is that Android users are not trying to be Apple users. Users selected or stayed with Android for a reason. Second, while Apple seemingly goes to great lengths to protect users privacy concerns, Samsung causes users to wave them, especially if the user wants to take advantage of their bloatware or apps.  For all these sacrifices, Samsung could have retained two things -  the use of TWO physical sim cards versus an eSim and physical and user control over their data.","March 3, 2024"

1639,SAMSUNG Galaxy S24,Rather B Fishing,5,"I did a ton of research before I committed to a purchase.  But it's not the same kind of research that techies can do.  I rely on their input for my impressions and then I ogle the colors and how it fits in my hand and how fast it goes and can I type better on the shrunken keyboard -- all while trusting the professional reviewers.  I'm writing this review for people like me.  Do your own research and trust in that.  I think I got a terrific phone that looks phenomenal and will last me for at least 7 more years.  And using it is so easy.  Transferring everything was so easy.  Now I'll have to master the camera.  Nitpicky opinions are no longer useful.  ""It should have square corners, it should have round corners, they did this, why didn't they do that..."" ENOUGH.

1643,SAMSUNG Galaxy S24,Pam K,5,"Prior to buying the s24+ I purchased a Pixel 8 Pro and really wanted to love it. That however turned into pure frustration with multiple glitches in the first two weeks of ownership that Google support couldn't fix. So much so, that the Pixel 8 Pro was returned in favor of the s24+. I am so glad I did that, because owning the s24+ has been nothing but pure joy. I mean this phone rocks in every way and the transition from my old s10 5g was seamless and straightforward. It literally took couple of hours from start to finish and there is no learning curve. With the Pixel 8 Pro transferring data was a complete disaster with multiple glitches, unfixable bugs and a few calls to Google support. There were some many issues with the Pixel 8 Pro that it would take an essay to list them all. Thank you Samsung for turning my frustration into pure joy!","February 1, 2024"

1682,SAMSUNG Galaxy A25,R Mitchell,1,"Bought this as it has 5g vs my older A51 that was 4g. Going from 4 to 5 was not great an experience.Here are the problems I've had:1 - Failure to re-connect to mobile network when coming back into range when out of range. I was an hour away from our house and received a call from my wife. Signal wasn't the greatest but at least I could understand her. When I went to leave, I opened Google Maps to show me the way home. Device said no connection. I remembered part of the way and figured when I was in range the phone would automatically connect. Well, I was only 1/2 hour from home and phone still gave 'no connection' message. Frustrated, I pulled over, shut the phone down and restarted it. Magically, it now had a connection!2 - Today it would not make a call (even 911!), all incoming calls went straight to voicemail and call history did not even show these calls. Restarted phone and magically, everything was ok!3 - Samsung music player in new phones does not play WMA files where the Samsung player in my old A51 would.I can't believe I spent this much money on a phone that I apparently need to restart every few days to get it to function properly and to restart it when I go out of range (I was only 1 county over).I may get iPhone next time or if an Android, definitely NOT Samsung.","September 3, 2024"
1683,SAMSUNG Galaxy A25,BGK,4,"TL;DR: Nice phone with a few common-sense features, and several issues.I'm an undemanding user, and my old A01 showed its age at the end of its support life. It began lagging more and more. Storage was full and apps wouldn't update because there supposedly wasn't enough space, regardless of the size of SD card I installed. The very definition of ""planned obsolescence"". Wanting to avoid this with my next phone, I bought something with more storage and memory this time around.SCREEN:After 2 Galaxy A15's had phantom screen press issues I decided to give the A25 a try since online resources suggested it had a different screen. Thankfully I've yet to have any phantom screen press issues about 2 months since receipt.Per gsmarena.com the A15's features a 800-nit screen, while the A25 features a 1000-nit screen. The noticeable difference here is that the A25 is actually usable in sunlight. The A15 is too dim. This is very important, and I feel a huge drawback of the A15.BATTERY:I subjectively feel like the A25 runs down the battery a bit faster than the A15. This does make sense given the hardware. Per nanoreview.net the SOC of this phone is more powerful than that of the A15, with a lower battery life rating. Per gsmarena.com the A25 has a 120Hz screen vs. the 90Hz of the A15, while both phones feature 5000 mAh batteries.Either someone at Google decided to finally build battery charge thresholds into Android after 14 versions (better late than never?), or this phone, due to price point and/or hardware, supports them. This should help improve battery lifespan of this phone.Neither the A15 or A25 feature wireless charging. I don't care. You might.HARDWARE:I DO care that both feature 3.5mm jacks. They make life so much better. Locating it on the bottom, unlike the A01's top-mounted 3.5mm jack, makes it easier to route a cable when it's in a pocket or car mount.It supports either dual SIM or one SIM and a microSDXC. This also makes life much better. I wish it could hold 2 SIMs AND a microSDXC at once, but it's better than nothing I suppose.The cameras are pretty good, but get grainy/pixelated when zooming in. My camera needs are modest compared to some, so I'm satisfied.The notch for the front camera is fine. In fact I grew to like the status info (battery, WiFi/cellular, notification icons, etc) being at the top, next to the notch, in the A01, giving more room to apps.The inclusion of stereo loudspeakers is a nice upgrade from the A15, especially considering the price increase. If you hold the phone at an off-angle they can sound strange due to the angle. For best results hold the phone with the screen flat toward your face.It gets a bit warmer than the A15. A quick internet search suggests it's the Exynos SOC. Thumbs down.I'm not particularly tough on my phones, so the plastic construction is fine for me. I put it in a silicone case. This makes it easier to grab, and was potentially far less expensive than buying a phone with metal construction.SIZE:The phone's too big*. The A01 was too big at 5.7"", and the A25 is worse 6.5"". I have long fingers and it's impossible to reach the top of the screen (where one might find a close or menu button in an app) one-handed without major grip adjustment, risking dropping the phone. The A01 was borderline uncomfortable in the (large) pockets of my pants, the A15/A25 cross the border. Squatting down must be carefully done lest it dig into your hip and cause discomfort or pain. Yes viewing more of web pages is nice. Yes I have to thumb to the next page of ebooks less when there are more words on-screen. Yes, more screen real estate is nice for Google Maps. But I don't NEED those things. In fact, I'd rather have an easier-to-carry PHONE, not a PHABLET I have to buy military cargo pants or a purse to comfortably carry.SOFTWARE:Mostly stable and as-expected: minimal changes to Android and the usual Samsung bloatware. There are some issues but I'm not sure if I can blame Samsung.1. Expo Go (an app used for mobile app development) doesn't allow interaction with the app I'm helping develop. Expo Go itself works fine on both the A15 and A25, but the in-development app would appear frozen. The in-development app works perfectly on Expo Go on the A01.2. ** 2nd Edit: The issue has resurfaced, and I've had to switch to a different camera app. Edit: this issue appears to have been resolved, perhaps via one of the updates the phone received since I wrote about it. Original issue text: ""I set the ""side button"" (power button) to turn on the flashlight when double-pressed. Using the included camera app before using the side button to turn on the flashlight results in the flashlight not working. This can be fixed by clearing the camera app's cache every time you want to use the flashlight, or using a different camera app. For all I know there's a fix for these, but I haven't found it yet (and I've looked).""3. Some third-party apps fail to start and require a second screen tap.VALUE:This phone is exiting the budget segment toward mid-range, but you get more for your money compared to an entry-level phone. More computing power, more storage and memory, an ultrawide camera, stereo speakers, a better screen than the A15, while retaining a 3.5mm jack.*But ""the market"" wants big phones (see the Marques Brownlee video ""Small Phones are Dead and We Killed Them"" video for more).","May 11, 2024"
1684,SAMSUNG Galaxy A25,R Mitchell,5,"I bought my Galaxy A25 5G on sale and was pleasantly surprised by its' many features at a very low price point.  My old phone couldn't be used in direct sunlight, this AMOLED display is phenomenal, HD, bright and readable in any light.  This makes using the cameras during the day very easy, regardless of the setting. The stereo speakers sound crisp and clear, and the response from the Exynos 1280 processor is fast.

Apparently, the shutting off/connection problems are a known issue and are non-repairable.Days after the 30-day return window closed, my son's phone kept turning off. Call Samsung customer service and the representative says it is because we aren't using the correct Samsung charger. Bought two of the recommended chargers and they are EXACTLY like the two we already own. What a waste of money!Continued to have phone issues. Contact Samsung customer service and they say to return it for repair. Next we get an email saying phone received by Samsung repair department but they don't have the needed part and it will take 10 days for them to get it.Update: (May 10, 2024), we get an email stating the phone is being returned -- UNREPAIRED. No explanation, just an 800 number to call for more info.  Called, complained, told they'd look into it. Called, complained, told it was being referred to another department.Update: (May 24, 2024) After weeks of complaining and being jerked around, we finally get a text that we'll get a cash refund. Heaven knows how long it will take to actually get it.We will replace the defective Samsung A25 with a different model. Meanwhile, we hold our breath and hope our second A25 lasts more than a few months.For years, we've been fans of Samsung products, having owned a number of Samsung televisions, monitors, tablets, phones. Samsung was our go-to for electronic entertainment. Normally, we love the products but the customer service is definitely third-rate at best.

1690,SAMSUNG Galaxy A25,Passingby,1,"I wish I could give Zero stars.  After owning the phone for a few months it began malfunctioning.  It would start and stop apps on its own randomly.  Sometimes it would start playing music, other times the weather or the calculator numerous other apps would start.  Today it was Lyft's turn, and it welcomed me as a new user.  At least I could make and receive phones and texts; everything else was a crap shoot.Samsung customer service was even worse.  The phone was past Amazon's 30 day return period, but I knew I was covered by Samsung's 1 year warranty... ha!!!  I've never been so wrong.  The first tech was a very pleasant woman to whom I gave permission to link into my phone and adjust some settings more to her liking.  She made sure I had the most up to date firmware (maybe software).  This did no good.  The next tech had me wipe the phone clean to original factory settings, and then download the current firmware.  This also did no good.  I finally got to a supervisor, and he said to take the phone to Samsung's nearest walk-in repair location.  Happily this was only a few miles from my home.  The tech there accomplished nothing.Today I went through the entire tech and then to supervisor routine again.  The supervisor promised to call me back in about 2 hours after texting me to make sure it was a convenient time.  He never texted nor called... what an insult to a customer.  So I tried again working my way to another supervisor, who had the ticket of my earlier call.  He insisted I sent them the phone to have their tech people examine it.  That this was done locally had no impact on him.  I raised enough hell to be bumped up to his boss who went on and on about Samsung's ""Policy"" of getting the phone back before honoring their warranty, and their was no other way.I give him a couple of other ways, such as buying a phone from Amazon and and sending it to me (as a loaner, if need be), or he could reach in his pocket and send me his phone to use while my phone in transit and being evaluated for a maybe 3-4 weeks.  He had a fit.  I gave him a few other options, but he said that only one of their techs had that authority.  I told him I'd guess the CEO of Samsung in Korea probably had that authority as well.  And that many other people had it as well, but he would only repeat Samsung's ""Policy"", which I then told him was in conflict with my Policy.I let him know that I'd contact the Ohio Sect of State, who loves tearing into big companies, and that I was sure his team of lawyers would find something, anything to sue them for.  I guess breach of contract, false advertising, etc.  When I told him government works slowly so he might not be served with the suit for a few years, but to be on the look out for it.Keep away from this phone, and never count on Samsung to honor their warranty.  They make it nearly impossible to dance to their requirements.","September 4, 2024"

1693,SAMSUNG Galaxy A25,Li P,2,"I get the feeling Samsung wanted to re-create the iPhone experience with this galaxy. I bought it because the android platform is much simpler and for years did not seem to have the problems of Apple downloading iOS that deliberately slow everything down.Not anymore. About two months after I had this phone a series of downloads were placed on Samsung. Now it takes about two minutes to boot up, so quick reboot.  Now put a bar on the screen, saying optimizing apps and takes a good full two minutes to reboot just to turn the thing on. I’m not talking about a reboot after updates. I’m talking about every time I turn on the phone. Quite a surprise to me. Samsung wanted to be like an iPhone, well, Apple may mess with battery obsolete all your accessories, etc. but at least it’s still boots up quickly.I can’t say that for this phone. It was functioning just fine if I’ve written this review a month earlier it would’ve been a 4 1/2 star.  Now, I don’t know what they’ve put on this phone.

And, for us boomers, who think a phone keyboard is out of a dystopian SciFi, the new speech transcriber, an AS (Artificial Stupidity) not only gets the words wrong, but makes you sit and wait for it to add punctuation (also usually wrong).

1697,SAMSUNG Galaxy A25,Grant S,2,"I realize people love their Galaxy phones, and that, in general, they're decent phones, and I likely just got a lemon, but I'm reviewing the phone I received, which was horrible.The good.  I was upgrading from a middle-of-the-road Motorola.  The graphics on this Samsung were great, smooth motion, and really high brightness levels.  Sound was also really good.The bad.  Like, really bad.  After spending two days getting everything set up on the new phone, I'm using it for navigation, and the phone just shut off.  Restarted, ran, for another few minutes, and shut off again.  No, the battery wasn't dead.  After that, it would stay running long enough for me to log in, then shut off again.  No drops, bumps, impacts, or anything.Found a video online that showed a setting that could enable these random shut-downs, but that option was not set on my phone.The phone felt warm, but not uncomfortably hot.  After keeping it powered off for a couple hours, I was able to get it going again, and it stayed up, but now, no texts or calls came in, and anything I tried to send said ""waiting for network"".  Texts would eventually send, usually minutes later.I'm using the phone in the same area I've lived for decades, and there are no known network dead spots.  Every other phone I've had, with multiple carriers, works fine everywhere.  If I randomly open Chrome on the phone, it's unable to get online unless I'm somewhere with wifi.  The mobile data network would eventually reconnect, but for me, the phone was just too unreliable, so I'm returning it.Silver lining here is that the phone starting failing almost immediately, so I was still easily within Amazon's return window.","March 12, 2024"
1698,SAMSUNG Galaxy A25,Anon,4,"I wanted a faster, more responsive phone than the awful Galaxy A03 I had previously. This one definitely is and I'm generally happy with it, but it's SO responsive that I've had to make it lock with the side key after it turned itself on in my work bag, opened the Clock app and turned off my work morning alarm. Just that one. It's a good phone overall, just gotta be careful because it will do things by itself.","April 23, 2024"

1702,SAMSUNG Galaxy A25,Doug Shannon,1,"This phone and my experience with Samsung has been an absolute nightmare.About 5 weeks after I bought it, the phone, text, and internet functions stopped working properly. The phone wouldn’t make or receive calls or texts, and the internet would work for a few minutes and then go dead for an extended period.The service carrier (T-Mobile) ran multiple diagnostics on the phone and told me the problem is likely the hardware. That’s when the chaos really started.I called Samsung, and they told me I need to call their local repair center.When I called the repair center, they told me they didn’t have parts for the phone, and it would likely take about 3 days to fix it because they would have to order the parts.So I called Samsung back to ask for a replacement phone, and they told me I needed to go the repair center to have them confirm that the phone is under warranty.So I wasted an hour driving to and from the repair center, only to have them tell me that the parts are backordered, and they don’t know when they are coming in.Soooo, I called Samsung again, and they told me that I needed to send my phone to them, and they will repair it or send me a new one in about 12 business days!I demanded a supervisor, and the supervisor told me there was nothing she could do to speed up this process.I told her that was outrageous and unacceptable, and she then called Amazon to ask for an extension of the return window. Kudos to Amazon for refunding the phone.Samsung then offered to sell me an A35 for $80 more than the A25, which I rejected.So here I am, about 10 hours of wasted time later, without a phone.","May 23, 2024"

I'm talking Bluetooth, wifi & cell service connection issues. We were lucky to keep cell service at all, much less 5G. Sometimes I'd get the old busy dial tone when I'd call my husbands phone, even if it was showing I had good cell service. His would do the same when he'd call me, never seen that issue before... My 1st phone had a faulty battery & connection issues within a week or so. We returned it for another one, hoping for the best. Then my husband's phone started having the same connection issues. My new phone arrived & guess what? Same connection issues right off the bat. It's for sure not our sim cards/service provider because our old phones work just fine. Thank goodness we still have them. Our wifi isn't cutting in and out on any of our other devices. My bluetooth headphones work & connect just fine to other devices! These phones are just defective! This has been such a nightmare!!!! We're switching back to the S series & will be buying elsewhere. Not sure if it's Amazon selling all the defective ones or if its just the A25 model in general.","March 8, 2024"

Obvioulsy, this is not a viable option for people to be phone less for two weeks.  Help yourself and move one from this product and this horrible customer service.Side note:  while the software for this phone (updates and such) is still supported, it is next to impossible to find replacement parts which is why you cannot get the phone fixed at local repair shops.","August 17, 2024"

Overall cheap quality.I decided to try a Samsung phone after years of Motorolas. Worst mistake ever. My old 2021 Motorola Stylus was better than this. The most important features for me are a definite downgrade with this. The cameras and wifi connection are a joke. Samsung added a bunch of useless features at the cost of a quality phone. It's bloated but none of that counts when you need it. Battery life is not great either. It seems like Samsung locks out features because it's midrange and not because the phone would be capable.

1781,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,Chase Johnson,5,"When I bought this phone it was listed as being used/like new.When the phone arrived and I opened it I was shocked, the phone looked and functioned as new, not a single scratch, bump, or defect whatsoever.It has been a few months since i recieved it, I wanted to use it before writing the review to be sure it continued to function at an optimum level. It has not let me down.Everything about this purchase was perfect, and the phone is still keeping up and functions just as a new phone. The camera is amazing, clear video, and all the settings are fun to use.There is 8 GB internal memory, and it has plenty of storage with 256 GB.The screen is bright, scrolling is super smooth, and there are many extra functions for the tech savvy.I have no complaints, this is an amazing phone and a huge upgrade from my galaxy s9.If your hesitant on buying a used device but want to save money, I can say from my expierience that you will not regret your purchase. Buy used, and enjoy your like new phone!","July 1, 2024"
1782,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,P Sjoman,5,"I agonized about what to buy for over a year. I am very picky and do not change phones very often. My previous phone was a Samsung Note 8 and this phone is almost the same size. It is a little heavier but I don't mind. The battery is great but avoid auto brightness if you want to have better performance. It has everything I needed without being larger size and twice the price. I have a brand new laptop for doing anything fancier than what I want to do on the phone so could not find any value in getting the S24 or S24+. I don't use the stylus much anymore either. If there isn't something you absolutely must have in the S24 series, this is a very good deal for half the price.","June 29, 2024"
1783,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,William,4,"Great phone, I have accidentally dropped it from my top pocket multiple times and it is still like new.I do not like Samsung Bixby, it interferes with simple phone off functions. Maybe its me, but privacy is out the window with almost everything that is connected to the internet. And I really dislike the Google playstore, trick of install this app, but you need to then sign up for this app, and also anther app, before you can use the first app.The phone has lots of memory, performance is good, picture quality is excellent. So far storage is also good. I Like USB C, charging rate is good, battery life is also good.  BT works well. I have used the Google maps GPS for directions, kinda clunky but it works. Overall a good phone.","July 30, 2024"
1784,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,William,5,"The device offers an array of impressive features at a competitive price point. It requires approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes for a complete charge.

I dont use phone very much just keep in car in case i break down or have emergency - phone fits well in my cargo shorts and is light and no problem carrying,"August 9, 2024"
1786,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,PNWACE,5,"I got this phone on sale for $400 (Black Friday 2023). So far, it's been very good for the price. The chipset is simply blazing fast. Everything feels snappy on this phone. Opening and closing apps are quick. Animation is smooth and does not stutter. The build quality is amazing and feels good to touch. So good that I did not use case until I first dropped it (more on this later).One drawback this phone has is battery life. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor is power hungry. The battery, while theoretically big, is quickly depleted. I mostly use my phone for navigation (Android Auto wireless), YouTube video playback, browsing on Edge, or social media chatting. My Screen on Time (SoT) life is expected to be 7 hours when fully charged according to AccuBattery Pro app I installed since day one of owning this phone. That is my usage without gaming ever. Expect the battery life to go down to around 4 hours or even less if you game because gaming is extremely taxing on your phone. It also heats up quite quickly, probably because it's drawing a bit too much power than it should have (inefficient CPU / GPU). One solution I have working for me is by activating Light performance profile under Device Care settings. This decrease the performance unless you're gaming. For my use case, it's perfect because it doesn't overheat anymore. That 7 hours SoT figure is with this profile turned on. Expect it to be around 5.5 to 6 hours SoT without this on.So about me dropping the phone, it was when I was changing my car's tires. I was crouching, so when it fell, it was about 12 inches high. The floor was concrete, and it was not clean. This is the worst combination because dust and debris are really abrasive and can easily put lots of dents and scratches on phone. Surprisingly, other than two scratches (one big, and one small), there's really no other damage. I was using matte screen protector at that time, so when it ended up falling screen down, it did crack the screen protector, but the screen remains flawless to this day. I assumed it fell by its side frame (charging port side), then it fell face down. I did attach the photo so you can judge the amount of damage done by this accident.","February 8, 2024"
1787,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,Kindle Customer,5,"Upgrading from an S10e, so it's not hard to impress me, I guess, though I knew what I was looking for in a new phone. So far it's very good, though I keep having to get used to how much bigger and heavier it is than me old one. Love the color. Must faster processing than my old one and much bigger battery life, but again, that's not hard, haha. So far no issues. Big screen is much easier to read on. I'm still a bit thrown by how big all the app icons are and that you can't make them smaller to fit more on one page but that's whatever.","July 21, 2024"
1788,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,JOSEPH BENDZINSK,4,"The phones camera is great. However the buttons to shut off and turn on are annoying. You have to press two buttons to shut it off and if you don't press it the right way forget it. Turning it on, you have to press it in the right spot. Also in my contacts they don't scroll properly. I never experienced these issues with any other Samsung phone, so a little disappointed. Would like to know if anyone else experiences these issues?","August 22, 2024"
1789,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,Jovindio,5,"The slower processor does not make any difference in the performance of this phone. I am coming from a Samsung Galaxy S9+, so it's great! The battery saving settings or features are nice too, there are 3 different ones to choose from. I love the telephoto lens on this! It can zoom a great distance, but my hands are not steady enough yet to take good pictures using that lens. I did get the larger storage size 256GB so I hope I have plenty of room for a LONG time now. Many of the features on this phone are very new to me being in a much older phone for a while, so I have plenty of more discovering to do!","August 5, 2024"
1790,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,P Sjoman,5,"I am absolutely LOVING this Samsung 23.  The picture quality is absolutely insane.

1791,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,Chase Johnson,4,The battery life is just ok. I upgraded from the S20fe and I feel like it had better battery life but this one isn't bad. The fingerprint reader however is a big let down. It rarely gets my finger print on the first try and I end up having to put in the password but other than those 2 things it's a pretty good phone.

1802,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,DK,5,If you can get this on sale like I did for holidays this is definitely worth it. (Bought 256gb version at $500 USD) I'm the type of guy who mostly uses this for calls/texts and light gaming. It can run games like CoD Mobile and Genshin Impact high settings pretty well but I'm not much of a mobile gamer so take that with a grain of salt. As for regular phone use it'll handle every task you throw at it. The thumbprint reader and facial recognition are both really fast and the phone feels pretty snappy compared to the old GalaxyA50 I used to have. Battery life is above average and I only charge the phone once a day. The phone seems to only heat up during long heavy gaming and generally stays cool.Other things to keep in mind:You can still get insurance for this phone like I did through the official Samsung care plan website. I also attached a magsafe case on the phone to make use of magnetic accessories. This way you can wirelessly charge with magnetic chargers and phone stands (very useful for car charging). Also allows me to get magnetic phone rings to hold up my phone without having to use adhesive on my phone case.,"June 5, 2024"

Much of the phone is the same as my previous Android phone, but there are a number of things that work differently,  so there has been a learning curve.  I quite dislike the ads that keep showing up for various Galaxy apps.  They are intrusive.

1814,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,juan c reyes,4,"Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because it doesn't come with a block, and the charger it comes with could be significantly better otherwise; it seems to be an amazing phone off the rip. I just switched back to android after years of being with Apple I got tired of my phone being outdated so quickly and the lack of user customization. I was looking at this phone for a bit because I wanted a galaxy and in the past my old androids when I was young would slow down and lag after a week of use. I haven't had this one for even a week yet but it's clearing all my worries thus far. My first worry was will it really be ""unlocked"" or will I have to go through a series of emails and returns to get one that accepts my Sim. Nope, popped my Sim in from my iPhone xr (I use cricket) it prompted me to restart the device so it could configure to it and boom. It even auto went to 5g shortly after (xr doesn't support 5g). There's that, I was also worried it would lag or skip like the cheaper androids I assume I had when I was younger but, man, this thing is smooth! I did a bit of extensive research and I was debating between this and a used s23 at the same price but after much debate and the risks of buying a used phone no matter who the seller is I landed back here and I don't regret it. All the good features as the flagships and none of the useless ones at half the price. Battery seems great thus far, just know that with every phone if you treat the battery with no care it will degrade so do a little research. Condition was amazing. Came packed in a loose box kind of but the phones packaging itself that was inside the box won't let anything happen to it. My only tip is buy a case when you buy the phone, it's very smooth and nice but also slippery and will fall out your pocket very easily between motions so keep that in mind. Hope I helped! (Make sure to select the version that comes with the free $100 Amazon gift card while it lasts)💪🏽","November 10, 2023"

If that never happened I would never have ""upgraded"" First of all the fingerprint reader is absolute garbage in comparison to the s8. This one barely works half the time when the s8 would work EVERY SINGLE TIME. Having the power button and the volume buttons on the same side of the phone is also stupid. It was super easy to take screen shots before when the volume was on the other side, now it is just uncomfortable. Also there being no way to actually know if I got a notification is stupid. There is no blinking light like on the s8. The only way to see is with the always on screen that is impossible to see from across the room. Another downgrade is the fact that I can not make the different notifications vibrate different ways. On the s8 I had text messages the long vibrate and notifications the two short buzz. Now its all mixed up in the same way with either changing call vibrate or notifications. Nothing to tell a text from a normal notification. I just don't understand way there were so many downgrades over the years in favor of a better camera and storage. So many of these changes are just to make the user experience worse.","May 26, 2024"

I decided to splurge a little and got this one because I had heard good things. I bought it on Amazon because it was $50 cheaper than at the Verizon store. I think I made a huge mistake. Everyone I know that likes this phone bought it through Verizon.  I WOULD NOT BUY through Amazon. It regularly will tell me I'm disconnected from my phone service, so calls and texts won't go through. The Bixby voice command thing will randomly say, ""I didn't understand"", even when my phone is locked. The battery life is okay. I had the moto g power before and there was no comparison.

We had been searching for a while for just the right one, has great reviews and a fantastic price. We received the original order quickly, charged it and started the set up. The phone needed a PIN to log in and set up. We thought this was unusual for a new phone. Started a chat session w/Amazon Help Desk and w/in 5 minutes was told that it appeared to have been used by a customer, returned the item and we ended up receiving it in error.  We were offered the return option so that we could purchase another one. We initiated the return process and mailed it out the next day.  The return message on my Amazon account stated that we would be refunded when they received the device. I have been monitoring my emails and still have not received any notice or tracking info.  I checked the tracking number thru UPS and it shows that the device was received 2 days ago.  I logged into my Amazon account and the Refund Status shows the same info but I am not scheduled for my $500+ refund until more than 2 weeks away.

1840,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,P Sjoman,5,"It's heavier and a bit thicker than my Moto G which I had to replace due to broken screen. Wasn't worth fixing. It feels solid, dropped a couple of times and it survived, thankfully. Picture quality is awesome.Be warned, it does not have a headphone jack. Wish it did so that I could connect it to radios which do not have Bluetooth.Also, could not get the provider I wanted because their system did not have this on approved list yet. Had to choose another provider (Visible by Verizon.) ATT & Verizon recognized it with no issues. But, Spectrum did not (that's the one I wanted), neither did Metro PCS (T-Mobile), which both companies did sell the exact phone at a higher price, weird.Definitely faster than my old Moto G Stylus (2020), I can browse much easier and faster. And, the apps load up faster. I just think it's a bit too expensive for what it is.I maybe expecting too much, but battery life seems wanting. I really didn't put it to a formal test, but during the first days of setting up the phone I had to charge it a lot. Even now, I have to charge it once a day, and I mainly use it for using the apps to do minimal work. So, take my rating on battery life with a grain of a salt.","January 3, 2024"
1841,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,Chase Johnson,4,"The black Friday deal was definitely worth it. It's a great phone, especially if you're looking for an affordable upgrade. Feels premium and not too costly to obtain. The cameras & battery life are great. What I like most is that its not ""curved"" but actually square with smooth edges- its easy to hold and grip. It's easy to interact with, up to date, transferring everything is simple. Very similar in size to a S22+, the weight may seem heavy to some. I appreciate how this was made. The only con is it comes with a USB-C to USB-C cable, meaning you have to buy a USB-C charger cube/box if you don't already have one since it's a USB-C type of charger. If you're used to the older charger types you can easily find a cable that connects to the charger cube/box but has a USB-C end on the other end of the charger.","November 29, 2023"

Then it was trying to set up everything that was moved over from ATT store. Then no talk to text, then no visual voice mail. I'm hoping Samsung can get this going for me, or this phone is going to be returned. Not satisfied yet this was a good move","July 27, 2024"

1845,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,Robert S,5,"This was a deal @ 399 on Black Friday 128 gb version. I did purchase the 25 watt charger, so that was an extra 15 bucks. Others that say the battery life is bad are probably wrong, mine is great. I live in a poor cell reception area, so I have wifi calling enabled. Assuming that is also their problem, when you have poor signal, it will drain your battery because it is working harder searching for signal constantly. My area is bad for all carriers. I have T-mobile prepaid which is better than anything else in my area. Easy switch, transfer files and just insert old phone sim card into new phone and restart. This was a replacement for a 5yr old  a20 that I recently dropped and broke the screen. No complaints and have had it for about a month now. Fast USA model. Shipped and sold by Amazon. Also grabbed a Ringke Onyx case which is pretty good, very tight and military grade drop protection. This thing is waterproof also up to 30 minutes submerged in 4 ft of water..go see for yourself on Youtube. Won't do this with mine but good to know. 30 times zoom pics are better than I thought they would be, especially moon.","December 22, 2023"

1847,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,AmazonCustomer,3,"I thought I did enough research on this phone before I bought. Yes it is unlocked, and yes it is a USA phone, but will not work with AT&T 5G. I spent 2 hours on the phone with AT&T and this model could NOT see 5G. I turned off WIFI and got a cell connection and in the upper banner it only said 4G. I even went grocery shopping a few miles away (read different tower) and it was also only 4G. My 6 year old LG v35 picks it up no issue. The model I received was a SM-S711UI . . I guess AT&T is only compatible with a SM-S711U. After I returned it and talking to Samsung support they said the UI model is LOCKED. I am not sure that makes a difference to get 5G or not, but as stated I could NOT get 5G on AT&T.","May 19, 2024"
1848,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,D Smith,4,"I bought this on Black Friday for $400 and at that price the S23 FE is definitely worth it. The Snapdragon processor can definitely keep up with the adaptive refresh rate up to 120 Hz. This phone can handle most games you throw at it without a noticeable drop in FPS. The camera is sharper compared to Samsung's A series line. The smaller battery is noticeable here so expect to charge your phone more often but it does support 25W fast charging. This phone does get warm after prolong and extensive use but I use a phone case so it doesn't bother me. There is no headphone jack, no charging block included, or expandable storage which stops it from being 5 stars. Overall though, this is a great budget phone if you don't want to pay flagship prices but still get 80% of the features of a flagship phone.","November 29, 2023"
1849,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,Amazon Customer,2,"Overall, the phone is average, but the battery life is very disappointing. I've searched online, and other people have the same issue. It is apparently due to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen1 (SM8450) being terrible for battery life. Even the normal Samsung Galaxy S23 phones (which were released before the Galaxy S23 FE) use the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen2 (SM8550), which is insanely better. Why they didn't decide to use it on this phone (which is newer) is beyond me. It was a terrible mistake on Samsung's part, in my opinion. There's no excuse for using a 2-year-old processor from your S22 lineup for a phone that was just released. Having a 4500mAh battery means nothing when the power-hungry CPU is sucking the life out of it. The battery of my 8-year-old Samsung Galaxy S9 is comparable to this phone, which is new out of the box and fully charged with dark mode and a dim screen. You are better off buying a phone with a processor that doesn't suck the battery life out of it like a vampire. Cheaping out and having such poor battery life is unacceptable in 2024.Updated: 7 months later and the battery is still atrocious. I honestly just wish I bought the S23+, S23 Ultra or the S24 phones. This phone is junk. I took a star off because the battery is dying even faster now.","August 10, 2024"
1850,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,P Sjoman,5,"This S23FE was a great upgrade from my S9. Easy to import all of my contacts, apps, photo's & files. It took some time using the smart swith app for Android as I had thousands of photos but was all done in the app. It's much faster than the S9 but the easy to use of the android system. It is totally unlocked as advertised and connected to the Verizon network right away. FYI: get a new sim card rather than using your old phones existing sim card. The only issue I ran into was by using my S9 sim card it was registered to the old phone and discovered it was in the new S23fe which it didn't like. It stopped communicating with verizon. The techs at verizon fixed everything quickly and it now works perfectly all at no charge! The camera portion of the phone takes ok selfies and basic photographs. The zoom feature came out a little blurry. Not the best camera setup but the phone/texting and all apps function as desired. All in all I'm totally satisfied with the newest Galaxy model plus saved over $100 by purchasing online. Samsung quality.","January 2, 2024"

I'm impressed with how well-made it is, and it's fairly priced too - way less expensive than the flagship.  The phone comes with a SIM slot key and a C-to-C cable. However, I'm not sure if it has an expandable memory slot. At the moment, it doesn't seem to have a keyhole for the memory slot, but it does have one for the SIM slot. I also purchased a protective case separately, which is clear, decent, and fits well in my hand and pocket.

Super responsive and handles all video and multitasking with ease.  Everything works great and the battery lasted all day which I haven't been able to enjoy in a long time.  I also had no issue with the fingerprint scanner after applying a glass screen protector and toggling the switch in settings letting the device know that it has a screen protector.  For those of you with AT&T, I was able to pop in my existing sim from family plan and the phone started thinking for a minute and then stated that it was configuring the network.

1880,SAMSUNG Galaxy S24,MZ,5,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️The SAMSUNG Galaxy S24 Ultra is an absolute powerhouse of a smartphone! From the moment I started using this device, it was clear that Samsung has truly outdone itself with this model. The 256GB of storage is more than ample for all my apps, photos, and videos, and the performance is lightning fast thanks to the latest AI technology and powerful processing.The display is simply stunning—vivid colors, sharp details, and deep blacks make everything from streaming videos to scrolling through social media a visually immersive experience. The build quality is top-notch, and the design is sleek and premium, giving it a luxurious feel in the hand.One of the standout features for me is the advanced camera system. The images are incredibly detailed, even in low-light conditions, and the array of shooting modes allows for creative flexibility. The battery life is impressive as well, easily lasting through a full day of heavy use without a hitch.Being unlocked and Android-based means I have full control over my device and can switch carriers or customize settings without hassle. The software experience is smooth, with Samsung’s enhancements adding value without overwhelming the core Android experience.Overall, the SAMSUNG Galaxy S24 Ultra is a fantastic investment for anyone looking for a high-performance, feature-packed smartphone. It’s reliable, powerful, and offers an exceptional user experience. Highly recommended!","August 15, 2024"
1881,SAMSUNG Galaxy S24,ideal deals,5,"PLEEEEEASE people, stop complaining about the display and things like that, the display is just AMAZING!!By looking at the low rating of the item, I was really impatient to recieve my device and finally write the review about it. I pre-ordered the S24 Ultra in Violet color, 512Gb version, and want to note that everything was fair as expected - I got the 512Gb version at the price of 256Gb one, and also 200$ Amazon Gift, which is a non-redeemable gift that works as a single time -200$ to your purchases FROM AMAZON, that you can use within approximately 5 or 6 months.Next about the device - it's really beautiful! I really love everything about it, the size, the flat screen, the back cover and cameras - design-wise this is a beauty.It has lot's of nice and fun features to play with, it's my second day of usage and I still have AI features to test, camera capabilities to check out, etc. And the S Pen - this is my first ever Samsung phone, and I really got used to it, and to be honest - it's sometimes a lot more comfortable to use the S Pen instead of your fingers. Some things in life are really designed to be accomplished with a pen and paper, this phone covers that need!The sound and speakers are veeery loud, I mean my whole office can hear my incoming notifications lol, and the quality of music listening, video watching, etc. - really nice.I still have to find out all of the capabilities of the camera, this is a separate big topic, but so far I can confirm what lot's of reviewers have already talked about - the normal photo taking is great, selfies look really amazing for a front camera, the zoom is fantastic with really good details, night mode results in bright as day photos (although a bit noisy) and video shooting is also nice with different mods.The OS is very nice and really sophisticated to say the least, I mean you can connect the device to a monitor, mouse and keyboard via some 5-in-1 Anker for example, and here you just got yourself a laptop with the size of a phone. OneUI is really the most rich software I've used so far, and before using it I was skeptical if I'd like it or not, but I'm really getting used to it, and the features like multitasking in a true desktop way on the phone - this is something else (not the Dex, just phone multi window usage, that's AWESOME).The battery is nice, maybe I expected something more by viewing some reviews with almost 20 hours of screen time or so, but really it's fine for a day of usage with QHD resolution, adaptive brightness, and app and AI usage during the whole day.The only disadvantages I want to mention are the price tag that is high (let's be honest) and the box contents, I mean why copy bad stuff from Apple and not include at least a small charging brick in the box? This is really uncool, especially within that price.I started with the display, but want to finish talking about it as well, it's HUGE, and I really like it, the corners are sharp-ended, but that gives you the advantage of viewing a non-cropped-out content, the resolution, the brightness, refresh rate... The display is a killer really, I really don't get the people that complain about the color, or perform some tests on the device, etc.... no need.Overall I'm really happy with my purchase, this is a great phone I can recommend to any software and hardware enthusiasts like me, and maybe to iPhone users as well, to come out of the box and see that there are other great phones out there in the world that can totally kill any iPhone with all the features and stuff you get.","February 15, 2024"

The pen works very well and is a nice little add-on.Some don't like the square edges, but I actually do. Doesn't feel clunky at all to me.

The battery life will last about a day and a half (with all my apps running), the screen is unbelievable, it is super quick, and easy to get around. I'm amazed with the camera, the sound, and the things it can actually do. My only complaint is: No external memory card, but I can even overlook that because it's perfect in every other way.

1886,SAMSUNG Galaxy S24,Chrade,5,"I heard all the hype, watched all the videos and decided to purchase the Samsung S24 Ultra from Amazon, (Shipped & Sold by Amazon) or rather my FB community purchased this for me through gift certificates. I'm blessed to have them. Regardless, the whole thing started when I decided to purchase something to advance the FB page through the use of video and such. I haven't been disappointed. Everything and I mean EVERYTHING about this phone is phenomenal. I also run a Radar Omega, a weather radar app on this puppy and it just hums along. I haven't been this happy with a smartphone in years, it's incredible. It's a beast though, know that. It's big and unless you fiddle with the settings, not a one handed phone for most. Teamed with an Otterbox Defender case it's well protected. There's no point in spending this kind of cash on a smartphone and cheaping out on the case. Don't hesitate purchasing this monster, well worth the ducats. Everything about it is screaming your name, treat yourself.","August 22, 2024"
1887,SAMSUNG Galaxy S24,J Brown,3,"I have waited awhile before i reviewed this product it is great for day-to-day use. At a minimum it takes great pictures and video. The screen is a great size for people with average to large hands. At first glance it looks like a standard ultra model its big, orbital lens separation, sturdy, bezel with a sleek design. I have been a Samsung fan since the galaxy line up started and practically owned every model out there to test and see which one is practical me the average joe. If you a minimalist this might not be the phone for you. This has the latest tech and probably will be overwhelming for you. This is due to the endless features that it has. If you are a gamer and have several hrs to kill on your favorite Mobile game this will meet your needs and then some. If you are that person that has been a Samsung note fan than this is the phone for you. If you're a movie junkie this will def suit your needs, when you're on a break from work or just hanging out. The color details are great especially in 4k. With this being said there are some quirks that i did not know existed and will pass it on to everyone. The s24 ultra has some drawbacks if you are purchasing it directly through Samsung. Your video calling will not work on with carriers - the reason for this Samsung does not have to voip it's a software according to Samsung. This is when you go to your contacts, and you have the option for video calling. This apparently cannot be put on by your carrier as they will deny trying to add it.(Samsung blamed the carrier , the carrier blamed Samsung) After several back-and-forth conversations Samsung told me to download a 3rd party app to allow me to video call. Other providers told me they could not help me. Now would you want to tell all of your contacts to download a 3rd party app and you would have to ask yourself ""would you do it for one person?"". Moving on to text messages and multimedia. You would normally be able pictures direct to people where it would show on the receiver's messages. But instead, it will send them a link that would expire in a certain time frame. They will then have to click to download the image to their phone. My question would be, how annoying that has to be every time i send someone a picture. They have to go through a ring of fire just to see the image or video. I have also asked about this with carriers they have stated, you guessed it go with a third-party app.  to the upside the phone is great. Standard android system as they have always been great but with a lot more at your disposal. Gpu is exceptionally fast (doesn't feel laggy or buggy) Camera is outstanding have taken countless photos with it. Videos are not grainy as some cameras from the galaxy line up once were. The phone is unlocked from Samsung. Bluetooth is great, connects fast and easy. Graphics are great for this model (does not overheat like the previous models when gaming) Overall if you want a phone that does the job this can do it. But do not purchase it directly from Samsung, purchase it through your carrier to avoid the hassles and dragged-out conversations i have gone through. I hope this helps you make your decision a little bit clearer on how you want to proceed on a new phone. I am giving it 3 stars from the manufacture. There was no recourse rectifying a solution. Also, for placing blame on another company and have me contact them, rather than Samsung trying to speak to the carrier direct that it also provides phones to.","July 18, 2024"
1888,SAMSUNG Galaxy S24,The Detroit Scanner,5,"The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, with its impressive 512GB storage capacity, sets a high bar in the smartphone market, offering a blend of cutting-edge technology, sleek design, and robust performance. Here’s a detailed review of this flagship device:### Design and BuildThe Galaxy S24 Ultra features a premium design with a sleek glass front and back, complemented by a sturdy metal frame. Its large, edge-to-edge display is visually stunning, providing an immersive viewing experience. The phone feels solid and well-balanced in hand, though its size might be unwieldy for users with smaller hands.### DisplaySamsung has long been known for its exceptional displays, and the Galaxy S24 Ultra is no exception. The 6.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED screen offers vibrant colors, deep blacks, and excellent brightness levels, making it perfect for everything from streaming videos to gaming. The 120Hz refresh rate ensures smooth scrolling and responsiveness, enhancing the overall user experience.### PerformanceUnder the hood, the Galaxy S24 Ultra is powered by the latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor (or Exynos equivalent in some regions), coupled with a generous 12GB of RAM. This combination ensures that the phone can handle intensive tasks, multitasking, and high-end gaming with ease. The 512GB of internal storage provides ample space for apps, media, and files, making it ideal for power users.### CameraOne of the standout features of the S24 Ultra is its camera system. The quad-camera setup includes a 200MP main sensor, ultra-wide, telephoto, and periscope lenses. The camera delivers exceptional photo and video quality, with sharp details, accurate colors, and impressive low-light performance. The zoom capabilities, up to 100x, allow for capturing distant subjects with surprising clarity.### Battery LifeThe phone boasts a 5000mAh battery, which comfortably lasts a full day of heavy usage. The inclusion of fast charging, both wired and wireless, means you can quickly top up the battery when needed. Additionally, the S24 Ultra supports reverse wireless charging, allowing you to charge other devices on the go.### SoftwareRunning on Samsung’s One UI over Android 14, the Galaxy S24 Ultra provides a smooth and intuitive user interface. Samsung’s software suite offers plenty of customization options and useful features, although some users might find the pre-installed apps and bloatware unnecessary.### Connectivity and ExtrasThe S24 Ultra supports 5G connectivity, ensuring fast data speeds and future-proofing your device. It also includes other high-end features like an under-display fingerprint scanner, facial recognition, and IP68 water and dust resistance. The lack of a headphone jack might be a downside for some, but it’s a common trend in modern smartphones.### PriceAs a flagship device, the Galaxy S24 Ultra comes with a premium price tag. The 512GB model, in particular, is an investment, but it justifies the cost with its high-end specifications and features. It’s an excellent choice for those who demand the best in performance, camera quality, and storage capacity.### ConclusionThe Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra 512GB is a powerhouse smartphone that excels in nearly every aspect. From its stunning display and powerful performance to its versatile camera system and ample storage, it’s designed to meet the needs of demanding users. While the price is high and the size may not suit everyone, it stands out as one of the best smartphones available in 2024.","July 24, 2024"
1889,SAMSUNG Galaxy S24,ideal deals,4,"I upgraded from my Note20.  I really like having the pen which is the main reason I got it.  It has  a cool feature that I use quite a bit where you can hold down the home button and it will analyze whatever is on the screen or whatever you are pointing your camera at and then show you web results.  Or you can circle something on the screen and it will search for that.  Or it will translate text on the screen which can be really useful.  I am particular about how my home screen looks so I really like the feature that can generate an ai picture and use the color palette from the picture to use for the phone theme colors and it can also automatically redo those gawdy standard android icons to ones that look nice with the current wallpaper.  I like the new messages app that works better with those pesky iphone users :). The camera is of course awesome as well as the zoom.  Speakers sound better than my old phone and the battery life is better too.What I dislike most is the sharp corners, they are uncomfortable even with a phone case on.  Also the weight is only about 1/2 ounce more than my old phone but it is noticeable.  If those issues were fixed then it would be a five star phone.","August 26, 2024"
1890,SAMSUNG Galaxy S24,MZ,5,This phone is awesome it's lightning fast switching between apps and loading games. the camera features are awesome. It's big but not to big fits in your hands just fine it's almost like having a mini tablet. The battery came 50 percent charged and charges very quickly. Also I like the color it's almost like a smoky black. I would definately recomend to anyone wanting a new phone to try the new galaxy series and also get one through this seller they are honest so you get what you pay for. The Samsung switch app made porting all my apps and emails messages calls and everything else from my old phone to this one a breeze just downloaded the app on my old phone connected them both to the same wifi network and clicked begin and it did the rest. As far as connecting it to my carrier (metro by T-mobile) all I had to do was contact customer care and register this phones IMEI number with them and then I was able to remove my Sim card from my old phone and put it in this one and that was it now I have a Samsung galaxy s24 ultra on the metro network.,"July 25, 2024"
1891,SAMSUNG Galaxy S24,ideal deals,4,"I've only owned every version of the Note series (now Ultra) since Note 4 (did not own the bendy screen one, just regular). So this is old hat, you either love this phone for its S Pen or just go with something else. I use my phone and the pen to make grocery lists, to do lists, draw, edit photos, etc.Pros:-FLAT SCREEN IS BACK. HOLY COW, how I've hated those stupid curved edges, glad that flat is back. Just bring back MicroSD expansion as well. I would say bring back headphones but apparently Android 10 or later killed external mic support via the combo jack. So, that's useless. This was the MAJOR reason why I upgraded my S23 Ultra, no joke, now I can put actual screen protectors on it, don't have to worry about optical glue-on glass that you then cure with UV.Cons:-Love that you can't turn off really annoying unnecessary notifications like the DAILYWELLNESS nonsense, weekly usage reports, ""hey we turned these apps off since you're not using them"".-Love that the galaxy store now has push notification ads that you can't turn off in settings or in app. That's super cool. Save that crap for your GALAXY A lines that are budget oriented, not your professional S lines.-New S Pen, now most of the time, the S-Pens that come with these are SERVICEABLE at best, but for whatever reason, this year's is painful to use, could be old age kicking in at 36 or just a bad design. It's too thin and too square. Last year's was slightly wider. NEVER MIND, just compared them, they're basically the same, it's the fact that last years had a rubberized texture on it, where this year's is just plastic, that's why it hurts to use.Meh:-A lot of this is more the same incremental improvements; cpu is beefier, display is brighter and more betterer, s pen is faster, touch is faster, etc. THE BORING STUFF.Overall:You always take a gamble with Amazon's ""USED"" stuff, and was worried that I was going to get a bad one. I bought, USED VERY GOOD, which usually means cosmetic damage somewhere on the device, and then it was ""USED VERY GOOD, potentially without box"". Mine looked pristine, slapped a screen protector and case on it right away to keep it that way, and it came with a box. You buy this phone if Samsung and styluses are your jam. OTHERWISE there's no real reason to get this. When there are a lot of companies with the 8 Gen 3 out there for a lot cheaper and in smaller more manageable body sizes. Like the S23 Plus or S23 standard. The Titanium Gray color has a slight champagne/earthen quality to the gray that I kind of dig that's subtle and sort of classy.","April 9, 2024"
1892,SAMSUNG Galaxy S24,Jconnery123,5,"Takes awesome photos, and seamlessly sends video to my RV's TV in HD, so no having to buy a second plan for internet for streaming.  I love this phone and connects at 5GUC on T-Mobile when my Samsung S23 5g work phone on with a different major carrier only gets 4LTE.  I have small hands and it fits fine. The only issue is that I bought the black phone as the description had a higher zoom, but I received the titanium color with a lower zoom.  I only discovered that after I had transferred all my apps etc.  I can't fault the phone though.","August 18, 2024"
1893,SAMSUNG Galaxy S24,Alex Beyer,5,"Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra 512gb unlocked version: What a terrific phone! The upgrade in performance over my previous phone is crazy. The 6.8 inch square corner display is the best out there. Battery life exceeds expectations - I charge the device every other day. Paired with the Samsung S View wallet case, it's an amazing experience. The unlocked version has no bloatware, and you can uninstall any app you don't need. I'm extremely happy with this device and recommend to all.","August 30, 2024"
1894,SAMSUNG Galaxy S24,A Williams,4,"all of the image displays are dull and kind of washed out.  The Vibrance adjustment seems to do nothing at all.

It is big enough that my kielbasa-sized thumbs can actually txt on it.","September 1, 2024"
1895,SAMSUNG Galaxy S24,b,5,I was agonizing about upgrading already from my S-22 Ultra. Technical research and reviews sounded like the S-24 Ultra camera was worth the upgrade (at least at Prime Day prices). I found this to be true. The camera handles colors significantly better than the S-22 Ultra (and the S-22 Ultra was quite good). The resolution is also a cut above. The excellent increase in night shot quality was truly surprising and very much anticipated.,"August 28, 2024"
1896,SAMSUNG Galaxy S24,R Kerth,5,I got the Galaxy S24 Ultra. It is really the best phone I have ever used and owned. At T-Mobile it was nearly $1300 so I went to Amazon and saved about $300. Great price for a great phone. Super fast and the battery life is fantastic. It takes a little time to set up but is well worth the effort. There is a lot of setting on this phone but it is worth it putting in the time to set up. Also used the wireless to switch over from my old phone (Motorola) and that went smoothly. It also has wireless charging built in. Highly Recommended!,"August 7, 2024"
1897,SAMSUNG Galaxy S24,RJS,4,"Bought this for my wife to replace her aging s20.  First thing is, the ""titanium yellow"" color is definitely more yellow than gold-ish looking.  A relatively minor thing, since most people use covers that are not clear.My wife is Filipino, and likes having the Filipino (Tagalog) language pack installed, but as of August 2024, there is NO Filipino language pack for Android 14.  Her old phone (S20) was Android 13, and had it available.","August 13, 2024"
1898,SAMSUNG Galaxy S24,Raymond Harrison,5,"This is my first ever refurbished phone. I already had a working phone, so I figured if it was trash I would just exchange it. But most of the reviews on here are very good, so I went with it.Packaging was OK. Comes in the original box, with all the accessories (charging cord, SIM tray pick and paper manual), but was slightly sloppily taped together in place of the original tear-away seals. Phone was missing the plastic removeable screen protector, as expected, and was instead placed in a plastic bag (though, not an ESD bag).Physically the phone showed up in basically perfect condition. No blemishes on the screen, back or edges. The only thing I found was a slight scratch on the silver ring of the outside of the top rear camera. But you can no longer see it after I installed a camera bump protector. Camera lenses themselves were untouched, which is the important part.S-pen works as intended. Phone was properly factory reset and it fired up as intended. Phone has been working flawlessly since it was received. Speakers, cameras, bluetooth, wifi, sim/network, all good. This was a great deal and I'm happy I went with it. It was like getting a big discount for basically a brand new phone. Would recommend.","June 28, 2024"

I mistakenly left my phone on in Machu Picchu and was shocked to have a call come in! Don't worry, I didn't answer.  It was my all-around communication device.","August 16, 2024"

1904,SAMSUNG Galaxy S24,Amazon Customer,5,"I love my new Galaxy S24 Ultra phone. I bought it during Prime Days for $300 less than the price TMobile and other carriers were charging. I was considering a refurbished phone but this new phone was such a good price (relatively speaking), I didn't need to buy the refurbished version. I haven't even explored all the new bells and whistles this Galaxy offers but I like it already. It hasn't been a difficult transition from my old Galaxy phone.","August 10, 2024"
1905,SAMSUNG Galaxy S24,Been using this,5,"It's a good phone for the most part...some apps have been changed from my old phone...Note9...I really like the old apps better. The clock was better before...the way to set alarms, the alarm music choices. The stylus is still there, which is great because I use it a lot. I would have like to have a slot for an SD card included, and also an aux port to use wired headphones, etc..I do like the flat screen vs the rounded edge one of the Note9...easier to scroll flat. The speakers are OK, but sound a bit tinny compared to the Note9. It's a little heavy for one-handed use. The Bluetooth is wonky...does not stay connected to devices...consistently and repeatedly connects and disconnects...and reconnects and disconnects...over and over and over again.I'm getting used to it's quirks...was almost ready to return it. A phone that costs over $1k should not act up like this. Also, putting all of the buttons on one side of the phone is silly. To screenshot something, you had better control with one of the buttons on the opposite side of the phone. All on one side is awkward at best to operate.","June 26, 2024"
1906,SAMSUNG Galaxy S24,Russell Thornton,4,"The phone is for me at least the best in the market. The only problem i've found is a little discoloration around the phone ports with just normal usr. The discoloration is not permanent, if you wipe it with a cloth it goes away and ut becomes as new. It's just annoying to have some parts of the frame get discolored with just normal and light use.Battery life with light performance mode is more than 24h, face unlock is a little hit and miss but fingerprint is perfect and fast, i used it for a month without any kind of protection and it didn't scratch. Charging is fast ( about an hour and 10 min from 0 to 100), the phone is very good looking, but the price is a little bit steep.","July 4, 2024"

1908,SAMSUNG Galaxy S24,antkar,5,"The phone for it's value is perfect, it feels good to hold and has some of the best specs and best additions for some one who is a tech guy like me. The screen is nice and one of the cleanest screens with the thinnest boarders on any Samsung phone. The squared screen is nice to see come back after seeing a lot of curved screen edges in recent years. I got mine for Amazon's prime day so I think it's worth at full price if your willing to pay that much but on discount it's a must for me. My last phone was a Samsung S9+ so this is a massive jump but we'll worth.","July 21, 2024"

Again loving this phone and the pictures are amazing.Loving the feel, look and style.Set-up was easy.  There is a slot for a SIM card (although not required to use cell phone) it made set-up so easy for me. I installed my Cricket SIM card, got it connected the network & WiFi and got it going.  The phone eventually prompted me (asked me)  to switch over the to internal eSIM card which would give me greater functionality and I said yes.  Set-up completed.  I'm definitely enjoying my phone and my daughter loves the stylist.  Also Samsung's costumers service was amazing....during the initial set-up I forgot my Samsung account password - with one phone call and in less than 3 mins  a customer service agent talked me through a simple work around.

The screen color issue has been improved with a recent update (3/7/24)Hopefully all of the bad can be fixed with a software update but currently the phone is borderline unusable due to the extremely blue camera(s) white balance and lacking signal strength. I cannot understand how after ALL THIS TIME, Samsung seemingly doesn't test their flagship phone before manufacturing and shipping.As for the cameras, they're okay if the white balance wasn't green/blue and dark. My Note 20 from 3yrs ago takes nicer looking pictures but it's honestly difficult to tell if the cameras are any good because it's just so green/blue. If you edit each image one by one on an appropriate editor (not the built in one), you can get the images to look pretty good but a typical iphone 15 takes the same looking image without any editing. Reviewers are showing carefully shot images of scenes. General picture taking without much thought results in pretty bland/poor looking images you don't care to share. I really wish they would allow you to adjust at least the white balance settings in the camera app such that the images it takes are correct to what you desire by default.I don't know what to say about all the tech reviewers out there raving about this phone. Either they were given a completely different phone or they're all paid off. I wouldn't recommend this phone to anyone until Samsung addresses the ridiculous issues. I do believe all but the signal issue can be fixed with an update but that would require Samsung to admit there's an issue and then address it which seems to be difficult for them to do. The signal issue may even be able to be improved with a radio update but again, Samsung needs to admit there's something wrong which they don't want to.I absolutely hate Apple due to their requirement for you to live in their ecosystem but this will likely be my last Android if Samsung or someone else can't get their act together on such an expensive product.On a very very positive note, the antireflective screen on this phone is genuinely incredible. It's the single biggest upgrade imaginable. Unfortunately putting any screen protector ruins that feature so I'm just going to use it without a screen protector. The phone is worth buying simply for the antireflection. It's THAT BIG of a difference. I cannot understand why this isn't getting more attention. The darn signal strength issue is the single biggest deal breaker and so unfortunate and annoying. It's about ~15% worse than my 3yr old Note 20.","February 3, 2024"

This one don't take nearly as great photos and has not a stable focus and gets fuzzy for Close Ups. I don't even have a Macro setting, well I can't find it anywhere. I joined a Galaxy 24S Forum on FB and it seems like 1/2 the people are satisfight and 1/2 the people have same or similar problems with the Picture taking like me.

The quality of all the pictures is a little bit to be said. Do not get me wrong it takes some pretty darn good pictures. My biggest problem with the pictures is that it takes a great picture of the item that you're taking a picture of. But blurs out the background. The only other thing that I'm really kind of disappointed about. Is the volume as far as on the phone. Phone calls. Even on speaker phone. If you have any kind of noise around you you will not build to hear it. It can play media very loud And usually have to turn it down a little. If they would find a way to fix the volume on phone calls. That would be a plus.,"April 18, 2024"

I still don't like the fact that you don't get a charge block. it used to be an experience to purchase a smartphone. unboxing was have of the purchase. now they might as well send it in a zip-lock bag because you only get the phone and a cable. $1400+ I feel like Samsung has just charged me more money for less product. If you are like me and use the S pen daily then this is the phone for you but if not get the s24+ or just the s24. I got the s24 for my employees and they all love them good phones at a much nicer price point around $700.The battery life on this phone is bar none! I went about 56hrs without charging the other day and I was using it most of the time. I was taking video watching and editing videos. surfing for vday presents on line and talked to about 30 customers on the phone once I realized that I hadnt charged in two days and i still had 16% left I was blown away.

1975,SAMSUNG Galaxy S24,Brian Hernandez,2,"I don't think so.  I've had the S3, S4, S10, S20, and recently dropped the screen on my S21.  I've been a Samsung loyalist mainly because it's the best Android option, not for any other reason.  That being said, it's time for a change.I wanted to segregate the apps from my old phone and what would become my new phone, so I tried manually transferring data and the only apps I wanted on the new phone.  I planned to use my old phone for GP App use, so less apps would have direct access to my primary cell phone (I'd use mobile hotspot as needed).  It didn't go smooth, maybe it was my impatience, but there was an awful amount of bloatware and AI non-sense that no one needs.  I tried uninstalling what I could and got only so far.  Then I just gave up and used the Samsung app to drag everything from the old phone to the new phone.  It was OK but bloatware reappeared.  I wasn't happy because it neither adopted all of my prior phones settings, and neither all of my new phones settings...just an odd combo of each.My main grievance was that the battery drained so fast WITH NO USE.  After buying this phone, I still used my prior phone mostly at home and my laptop as well.  I rarely used the new phone for anything.  The battery simply drained dramatically for no reason.  I checked what apps were the cause and 1.  didn't list any apps used other than what I actually did use 2.  I think Windows Defender or whatever the Samsung equivalent is, was the primary source?  But even then, the % was so low.  But why go from 100% charge to 75% overnight, while I'm sleeping?  No thanks.  I gave it 2 weeks and this didn't change.  I thought some smartypants AI non-sense would adjust it, like I read somewhere but no dice.Also, somehow this phone/software kept backing up data I did NOT want backed up and in any cloud.  With the primary competitor to this phone the Pixel, a Google phone, I'm not sure what Android options remain.  I'm leaning towards a Tablet I can carry around and connect via Mobile Hotspot for apps and other uses.I also had mediocre data and cell reception quality.  It might have been the protector/case it was in, because I've had many Galaxy phones since the S3 with no problems in that department.","August 26, 2024"

The inclusion of 5G connectivity is a notable plus, ensuring faster data speeds and improved network performance. The device's display is vibrant and provides a satisfying viewing experience for multimedia content. The camera system, though not flagship-level, captures decent photos for everyday use. The battery life is commendable, providing all-day usage on a single charge. The overall design is sleek and modern, giving the phone a premium feel.

1984,SAMSUNG Galaxy A14,Frances NasserRusso,1,"I needed to upgrade to Android 13 for work, and figured my best bet was something slated to go until 14 as well so I picked this out as a fairly cheap option. Since then I have had waves of negative experiences with the software on the phone, and today capped it off with something that defies logic.When first setting the phone up, I was informed my PIN was too weak, and now needed to be 8 digits long. Alright, a bit weird but I can handle it. Then it maxed out at 3 fingerprints instead of my previous phone's 5, which has caused me minor grief because I've found that the fingers I chose to forego, index and thumb on my left hand, I actually used a fair bit more than I realized.Next up was the One+ UI, a disaster of an interface that took me hours to figure out how to bypass in favor of my typical layout. This comes packaged with an obscene amount of bloatware, and there's a hardware-based warranty void if you attempt to root to remove any of those apps, which I will never use and only take up space on the device. Fine, whatever, I'll adapt.Then it decided it wasn't going to connect to my PC with a transfer protocol, choosing only to charge itself from the connection. This was the first major issue with the phone, as I frequently moved files between my PC and previous phone and now am unable to do so directly, making file management a pain. There was one option I had left to work around this, a thumb drive with USB-A on one side and USB-C on the other, so I could connect it to my PC, drop desired files onto it, then connect it to the phone and offload them. A pain, but a workaround for the time being.And then it decided it didn't want to do mobile data after disconnecting from a Wi-Fi signal, requiring a full reboot to register that, yes, I do in fact pay a significant amount extra on my mobile plan for unlimited data and it should be using that. This would reproduce every time I disconnected from a Wi-Fi signal, until finally I opened the developer options and forced it to keep mobile data on even when on Wi-Fi.And then today I noticed the thing that finally bothered me enough to say something. I was transferring an album to the phone and happened to check the notifications pane, and it said it was charging the connected USB device. Let me repeat that: it was CHARGING A FLASH DRIVE. The drive was concerningly warm, and there was no way to disable it as the USB settings were apparently controlled by said flash drive. I checked online for any sort of solution or workaround, and found that this has apparently been the case since at least 2017 and Samsung has done nothing about it. This absurd misunderstanding of basic hardware is so far beyond what any QA should have caught, and if it's been part and parcel of Samsung devices for SEVEN YEARS then I'm done with Samsung's ecosystem. Y'all can keep your bloatware and atrocious programming; see how many customers it wins you.Editing this review on account of new developments; I now have grounds to take off the last pity star I was willing to give. The phone has started refusing to recognize its mobile data as an option every time it connects to Wi-Fi. I went so far as to order a new SIM card to see if that was the issue, but the symptoms have started to recognize on the new card as well. Given that I use this phone for work on the go, this is absolutely unacceptable. One star, fix your useless OS.","February 3, 2024"
1985,SAMSUNG Galaxy A14,Zen Master,5,"Let me preface this review by saying this is a secondary phone for me. I use it primarily for work. I bought this unit to replace an A21 whose memory limitations were slowing down the phone; speakers could be a little louder. Cons: facial recognition does not seem to work well. However, this is a priority C feature for me so in my case, no big deal. Pros: screen size is perfect for me, this is as big as a phone should be in my opinion; tough, dropped multiple times with no issues; bright screen legible in sunlight; good processor, runs apps fast - I play call of duty very well on this; 5g works great, very smooth video; charges fast, use usbc on AC adapter, charges swiftly; last but not least battery life is incredible even when under great use....estimate it at about 36 hours. Best battery life of any phone I've worked with, easily. Highly recommend.","April 2, 2023"
1986,SAMSUNG Galaxy A14,Lepidolite Mica,3,"This is a decent budget phone, but I really wish I spent a bit more and got something thinner (check the measurements!!!), smaller, and with more performance. It does tick every other box though, I think this phone would be 10/10 for use as an Uber driver or similar. But if you're even a slight power user, I think spending an extra 50 or 100 bucks would benefit you.","November 27, 2023"
1987,SAMSUNG Galaxy A14,M Avellan,5,"I bought this new 5G Samsung phone as a replacement for my outdated 4G Samsung. The new phone is slightly larger and heavier, but I do like the bigger display which features sharp resolution and vivid colors. I bought an unlocked phone and transferred my Mint Mobile sim card. Everything worked perfectly. If you use your phone for high-end photography, playing games, or watching TV, maybe the more expensive phones are worth it. However, if you talk, text, use the web, and access apps like Google Maps, Facebook, Twitter, etc., then this phone will do nicely. As others have pointed out, a USB-C cable comes with the phone but no charger. I chatted with Samsung support, which recommended the 15W charger. I bought it on Amazon for under $16.00: Samsung 15W Wall Charger Type C (USB-C Cable Included), Black. You could get just the charger for 88 cents less, but I thought having a second USB-C cable was worth it.","February 23, 2023"
1988,SAMSUNG Galaxy A14,Amazon Customer,4,"Alright there are many other phones out there for much much higher prices. But I just needed a decent phone that worked and this has met my expectations. The battery life is great. Gets me through my day. The screen is big enough and the camera isn't terrible. The phone speed and storage has kept up with my needs at work. Overall for the price I am very happy with my purchase. If you're looking for an average phone, nothing fancy then this is it. Also I needed this phone because it is one of the very few on Amazon that are unlocked for a CDMA Carriers like Boost Mobile. While all these cell phones say they're unlocked, most are for a GSM Carriers. Took me a lot of searching to find a phone for my carrier and price needs. I popped my sim card in and it worked right away.","January 18, 2024"
1989,SAMSUNG Galaxy A14,Rick29,2,"I bought this phone in Oct 23. I like the the fingerprint reader so I can unlock the phone without having to type in a code in a crowded environment. Though it does take a bit for the phone to recognize my fingerprint.Since this was a new phone, I expected the battery life to last at least a couple of days before needing a recharge. Just like I had on previous phones. right of the bat, I barely got one day out of the battery. And it was creeping down from there.About 6 months later, I dropped the phone (And it was also in a ballistic shell) on one of tactile plastic mats so blind people can detect curb transitions from sidewalks to streets or the boundary from a train station platform to the tracks. The display almost popped out and the power switch actually turn 90 degrees in the shell. The fingerprint reader no longer worked and it was an effort to tun the phone on or off. I ended up having to use a pen point. Then that stopped working. In order to wake the phone up, I had to plug it into a charger or headphones.  I thought the failure of the power switch was a flukeI bought another A14, set it up, checked the battery charge,  transferred the apps, data and the SIM and SD cards. I was in the last stage of the configuration, pulling it out of sleep mode to enroll in the fingerprint reader and do a few final configuration tweaks. And the power switch failed. Pretty much like its predecessor without it being dropped. I attempted multiple times to wake it up without success.For me that tripped it over to being a piece of crap. I was not happy with having to buy another A14. I found the A15. It has a better rating, less expensive, more storage, RAM and better camera. So far so good but have  only had it operational for a little more than 12 hours. But it's already looking the battery life is much better.","May 22, 2024"
1990,SAMSUNG Galaxy A14,Amazon Customer,2,"I have been utterly frustrated with this phone as of late.  I have had this phone for 11 months and may look at replacing it early (I usually replace mine every 2-3 years).When I leave home or work, where I am on a call originated under WiFi calling, the call drops as soon as I'm out of WiFi ramge...only to find that I have zero bars for my call.  I do the airplane mode trick (off and back on) to no avail.  So, I have to restart my phone to try to acquire a signal.The same applies to 5G.  So, I havebto.jump through a buttload of hoops to play Amazon Music or get it to work with my Echo Auto.This is really frustrating because this should not be happening.  I live and work in a city where downtown to the suburbs is a population of over two million.  I should not have to restart my phone multiple times a day to do business or personal calls, or listen to podcasts.I highly recommend looking at other options than this phone.","August 10, 2024"
1991,SAMSUNG Galaxy A14,Lepidolite Mica,5,Galaxy 14 5g I've only had a few weeks so may need to edit later but so happy w this phone! It was listed as #2 for best camera in a consumer report and I sell mobile homes so camera was top priority. No comparison from my old moto g7 play!! What an uprade and a fraction of the cost of the i phones ( which was #1 for photo) plus I believe its new not refurb. Super user friendly editing features. Rarely have to use my professional photo editor and better adjusting for various lighting. As far as other features seamless transition from my last Android. Not tecky but was able to figure out most everything on my own. Simple interface without clutter. Very well organized basic apps. No obnoxious intrusive Google apps. Easy to turn off those. Came with a cord but no box to plug into wall but that was no problem because had cords from last Droid. (C) Was a little finicky with which cords it would charge with ( the low quality ones didn't charge so tossed them) Unlocked. I switched to at & t. They were able to transfer # and contacts. If I was looking for something to complain about. The touch screen seems inconsistent in some apps ( varying sensitivity) but it's probably an adjustable setting. This is the first time I can honestly say I like the new phone better than the old I was forced to upgrade for a great price on prepaid plan. Thank you!,"December 9, 2023"

1993,SAMSUNG Galaxy A14,T,5,"I will only buy a Samsung phone for many years I was Moto person.  But they have horrible tech support and the phones are ONLY updated for two years.  NOT from date bought but date released which means many are out of date as far as updates go, again they and most other Android makers only update phones for two years if that..  I was going to buy a apple but I do not like all the limitations for them.Well I started deep research and found out that Samsung is the only company doing security updates for 5 years.  And on the models that have the KNOX security it is almost as good as it gets without being rip off by Apple's over price products.I first bought the A54 3 months ago for $400.00 and I believe it is one of the best phones for the money and it has the Knox well my wife needed a new phone and I bought the Samsung A14  for $199 it is excellent no it lacks the Knox security but is covered for 5 years of updates.  The only downside to the A14 is the finger print reader is in the on/off button.  That is a draw back unlike the A54 that it pops up on the front very easy to use.  Unlike the A14.  But that aside I love both of these phones and Samsung tech support is good not great but very good.  Just my thoughts.  I think anyone wanting to save money and get a great phone here they are.","August 8, 2023"

The fingerprint unlock is awesome.  All I have to do is pick up the phone and it comes on.  The sensor is on the side where you would normally touch when picking up the phone.  Far more convenient than the onscreen fingerprint lock other phones have.There is one slight annoyance, but it is probably a me issue.

After about 3 hours of customizing the phone and installing my additional apps, everything is looking pretty good. A lot of settings to make the phone more robust and easy to read.  The screen is clear and large enough for all of my uses and it has a good camera.  It is super easy to set up once I had the text and screens I wanted.  When I added my sim, the same slot has a place for a SD card where I keep all my music on along with a complete backup of the phone.

1998,SAMSUNG Galaxy A14,Amazon Customer,4,"Though this phone is on the bulky side, everything works well. No general issues with hardware.The focus of this review is the inability to turn off noise reduction in the Samsung camera app, which seems like the only way to access the full 50 MP camera when you don't want pixel-binning. You end up with many photos (at all resolutions) looking like smoothed oil paintings.Non-Samsung apps like Open Camera can turn off NR, but only at the lower resolution it allows. Samsung should let users decide if they'd rather see digital noise with fine detail vs. smeared images, except in very good light.","June 30, 2023"
1999,SAMSUNG Galaxy A14,JustinCase,5,"My Moto 6G had started to randomly reboot itself, usually at the worst times, so time for a replacement, but it had served me well for several years. After doing some searches on lower cost phones (not an iPhone person or in need of a very expensive phone), I bought the SAMSUNG Galaxy A14.So far I couldn't be happier. Large screen, fast, great camera; and while only 64G internal storage, for $10, I added a 128G sim for added storage. I was able to easily have the phone copy and load all my apps, photos, and data from my Moto 6G, using the Samsung Smart Switch app. I especially like the fingerprint reader being on the power button, allowing me to easily one-handed turn on the phone and unlock it. I'm not a huge smart phone user and this has everything I could want in a smart phone and more, at quarter of the price of an iPhone 14.","August 12, 2023"
2000,SAMSUNG Galaxy A14,Amazon Customer,5,"So far I really like this phone. I needed a new phone and didn't want to spend a lot and didn't want to have to learn how to use a different kind of phone. I've had galaxy phones and so I wanted to stick with that. This was the best priced phone that was 5G and had at least  the same features as my old phone. While this is a 2023 and my old phone was 2019 there isn't a lot of new features. I'd say mostly there are upgrades in screen quality, camera quality, storage capacity,  network, and some minor added features like it can link to your smart devices with an app, but I use Alexa on my fire tablet for that. I'm sure there's other new things I just haven't found yet but I don't do to much on my phone besides calls, texts, and emails, so I'm good; no need for a $500+ phone for me.","July 14, 2023"

2002,SAMSUNG Galaxy A14,C4given,2,"I got this A14 5G to replace an aging Moto G Pure and in terms of speed, it's a little faster.  But the screen on this A14 5G is HORRIBLE, I mean it is like the screen from an old cheap Kindle Fire tablet is what it reminds me of.  The Moto G Pure has an IPS screen which looks great even with the blue light filter that tones down the blue light.  The A14 5G screen when you turn the built in blue light filter on just turns like an eerie yellowish orangish nasty color, I can't stand it.  The reasoning the screen is so bad is because Samsung is using a PLS LCD screen on this phone versus Motorola is using IPS screens in their budget phones which displays so much better in all scenarios.  The other thing since Samsung's cheaper phones don't have OLED screens, they can't use always on display, so you have no idea a notification came in if you have the sound off, you have to turn the screen on to see if anything came in.  Motorola has the Moto Peak display where if you bump, touch, lift the phone it displays time, battery level, and notifications briefly before it fades away which is awesome.  Overall the A14 5G is just disappointing due to the screen being garbage.  If you are looking for sub $200 phone, get a Moto G, they are the king of sub $200 or below $200 phones.  They just released the new Moto G Play 2023 which I think will be a better phone for the price. If you can pickup a Moto G 5G for the same price, that is way better than the A14 5G.","February 4, 2023"

I discovered that I had received a dual SIM phone with a single SIM tray. I specifically wanted a single SIM phone, and nowhere in the description or pdf manual did it say anything about being dual SIM. I am returning the phone to Amazon. I just want other buyers to know how to check if they received a dual SIM phone as well if that was not what they wanted. You can check by dialing *#06#. If it is dual SIM there will be two IMEI numbers. And also be advised that you will have to buy a separate wall charger, as one does not come with the Samsung Galaxy A14 5G phone.","August 26, 2023"

I didn't need the newest fancy phone but I wanted something that would work and that I could use traveling overseas. That one worked fine until the battery started to fail.  I was looking for another used phone when I saw the Galaxy A13.  I tried to buy one but couldn't.  They were apparently all sold out.  Then I saw reviews for the A14.  It sounded better than the A13 and was cheaper than the used phones I looked at AND cheaper than the used Galaxy 7 I bought previously!  This thing meets all my needs.  Battery lasts 3 days with steady use.  Good reception in areas with poor coverage (which is everywhere in rural Maine).  Great cameras, beautiful screen, lightweight.","April 4, 2023"

This is a very high quality phone. Best part is the battery life, truly incredible. My old phone lasted maybe 2 hours on full charge. With this phone, one charge lasts literally the entire day, even with consistent usage.  As a word of warning, the charger cord they send with the phone has a male usb-c head on both ends, so you need to get a wall adapter that is made for usb-c, or buy a different cable. I totally missed that, and spent the first day I had the phone sans-charging capability. That said, because the battery life is so long, it was actually fine, lol.","July 23, 2023"

And the new Android version has added swipes for commands I had used frequently: do-not-disturb (2 swipes instead of 1) and force-stopping a mis-behaving app.Overall it's a slight improvement over my prior phone.

I may replace it later on but for now it works as advertised, just lacks a bit of performance after 2 Note earlier generations then the A50 to compare.

Samsung and Android 13 have so many new settings that it's taking a while to configure properly, but that's my problem.

I got a new phone because my previous phone had become very slow over a couple years of use. This phone reached the same levels of sluggishness in a couple of months. Truly baffling to me that this was sold in competition to the pixel because it feels like it's several generations behind.

If I could, I would return it immediately! I have been trying to get used to it, but it is just awful! Unfortunately, my old phone just died so I had to order one quick. This had pretty good reviews and a great price (I refuse to pay many hundreds or thousands of dollars for a phone) but have regretted it since. The battery literally takes overnight to charge from even just 40-50%, the voice text is gawd awful and doesn't understand anything I say, skips punctuation and will just stop in the middle of a sentence. I can hardly send pictures or any other attachments in the text area. But it will randomly attach pictures to messages I am trying to post on a work chat board (luckily most of my pictures are just cats and other cute animals I meet) so that's fun-sarcasm. If you are thinking about buying this phone, my advice is to just keep on scrolling and find something else.Addendum: here's a prime example of why I hate this phone.

2074,SAMSUNG Galaxy A14,Marilyn Walker,2,"Because of the non specificity of this listing, I went directly to Samsung to ask a question. Because this has the 3.5 mm headphone jack, I asked if this phone had an activated FM tuner chip, and a pre installed FM tuner app. They confirmed it did. So I bought it. Alas, it does not have this feature, though even while I had this phone in my hand and chatted with Samsung, they swore it should... Obviously there's a glitch somewhere. Maybe this is so new, no one knows what features it actually has.","February 2, 2023"

2080,SAMSUNG Galaxy S24,Kevin J Leahy,5,"I decided to finally upgrade my S8 that I've had for 6 years. I've been a Samsung S series fan for a while so I knew I'd get the S24, I went with the base model over the 24+ or Ultra because I prefer the smaller size.My initial impressions: Its a very fast phone, switches seamlessly between tasks and is lightning quick on searches, apps, ect.  The screen is beautiful, and the touch screen is VERY reactive. The battery life is also way better than i expect. I don't even charge my phone every night becasue i don't need to. It was also super easy to move to the new phone, just swapped over my sim card and was able to transfer my contacts ect with Samsung's transfer software with just a few clicks.The one negative: I find the S8 a more aesthetically pleasing phone. The S24's edges are more squared, less rounded. It looks boxier. Now I don't really care all that much because I keep my phones in case anyway, so this is a small negative.","August 8, 2024"
2081,SAMSUNG Galaxy S24,Inknochen,5,"My previous phone was an LG and that was a fantastic phone. I had it for a very long time; went through 2 batteries, but it was time to replace it.This Samsung S24 has been a great replacement. It is a little smaller than my LG but it is not as bulky so the smaller screen was just something I got used to quickly.It is quite a bit faster than the LG and I have no problems running the apps that were copied over.Overall I think I made a good decision getting this instead of the Ultra or Plus.","August 13, 2024"
2082,SAMSUNG Galaxy S24,Kevin J Leahy,5,"This is a great phone with lots of features.  Transferring everything from my old phone to the S24 was a breeze and worked flawlessly.  It also takes great pictures and Samsung has added several new edit functions.  I struggled about going with the Samsung vs a Pixel.  I think either phone is great, but Samsung wins out in my mind.","August 30, 2024"
2083,SAMSUNG Galaxy S24,Richard Wright,5,"I have been using this for a few months and would definitely buy it again. It is thin but with strong corners. Non-slip feel to the plastic, feels more expensive than it is. I managed to drop it few times from 3-4 feet and no damage to the case or phone at all. The buttons on the side feel excellent - just the right size and resistance.The only possible negative - the camera lens cover reduced photo quality, created some unwanted stars and loss of sharpness, so I removed it. Can't ding a star for it because using a true photo quality neutral filter would have cost three times more than the case itself.Just get it - you will not be sorry.","August 21, 2024"
2084,SAMSUNG Galaxy S24,Frisco Jim,4,"You would think if you spend almost $1,000 for a phone, it would come with a charger, wouldn't you? It doesn't.

2085,SAMSUNG Galaxy S24,AlexF,5,"I bought this Samsung S24 unlocked phone to replace my Google Picel 6 Pro. My 6 Pro had problems with 5G reception and also I was missing phone calls intermittently.The S24 obviously has a smaller screen than the Pixel 6 Pro but the S24 is a brighter clearer display. The reception is excellent on the S24, the camera is not quite as good as the Pixel 6 Pro but it comes pretty darn close. It also has the Magic eraser and similar Pixel 6 software.The Samsung S24 has a sharp picture but the colors are a bit better on the Pixel 6 Pro. The night shots on the S24 can look a little grainy where the Pixel 6 Pro was clearer. All these things can be edited to look better. The battery on the S24 lasts much lo ger than the Pixel 6 Pro.I am happy with the Samsung S24 so far.","August 9, 2024"
2086,SAMSUNG Galaxy S24,Lucy,1,I got to use it for less than a month before the usb port failed completely. It was never in water nor even wet but it says it is. Support is not helpful. Nothing they said solved the problem. The phone is even capable of taking 30 minutes submerged but support will tell you this issue won't be covered by warranty. Phone is beautiful.

2090,SAMSUNG Galaxy S24,Kevin J Leahy,5,"The three features I valued most when purchasing the Flagship S24 were the exceptional Prime Day deal, the cutting-edge Snapdragon 8.3 processor, and most importantly, the seven years of software updates. I was close to choosing a Motorola until I discovered it only provided one year of updates. I selected the base model S24 because the higher-end models had features like photo and video capabilities that I would seldom use. My only minor gripe was the slippery back; it necessitated the purchase of a durable cover. Nonetheless, this phone is outstanding, and I'm confident it will serve me well for at least seven worry-free years.","July 26, 2024"

Every other Android phone I've ever had has allowed me to assign a different notification sound for different events, but not Samsung. That's profoundly disappointing, especially since this phone I've just bought is supposed to be a flagship model by a highly sought-after brand.

2114,SAMSUNG Galaxy S24,terry reeves,3,"I switched from Galaxy S7. I love the S7 but the CPU and RAM can't keep up with today's apps and websites. The S24 a decent phone with some annoying problems. It feels like a $400-500 phone.Here are my complaints:- The most annoying problem so far is that videos are glitchy, choppy, or laggy every few seconds. Whatever you want to call it, it's the opposite of smooth. This happens in every streaming app and website I've tried so it's not isolated to a single app. It's not a bandwidth or buffering issue. This happens in Adaptive (120 Hz) and Standard (60 Hz) motion smoothness. I enabled the Show Refresh Rate option in the Developer menu. I don't know if it's accurate, but every time a video gets laggy the refresh rate shows 24 (in Hz). When it shows 60 or 120 the video is smooth. The OS should should detect if a video is playing and sync to the frame rate of the video or set a fixed 60 Hz refresh rate.- The physical buttons click very loudly. When I hear that click my brain thinks ""cheap junk"". They're loudest buttons of any current or previous phone or tablet we own (which is a lot). I'm guessing this is a QC issue and most people don't experience this. I have resorted to using apps to open the volume control and turn off the screen so I don't need to click those buttons.- All three buttons are on the same side now. I need to use two hands to reliably take a screen shot. Yes, I have gotten it to work a couple times with only my right thumb but only after locking the screen and changing the volume a few times.- Samsung frequently nags me about signing in. I have uninstalled and disabled as many Samsung apps as possible, but it keeps asking me to sign in.","February 27, 2024"

2124,SAMSUNG Galaxy S24,lina hernandez,2,"I had been running an iPhone 12 and an iPhone in general for a few years and decided to go back to Android due to UI and the ability to have many more app level options available, particularly in nav app options.The UI and performance overall on this phone are very good. Battery life in normal use is solid and charge rates for cabled charging are very fast. Photo quality is solid, overall it's a good phone.A major flaw is vehicle use and I use mine constantly for Spotify and running nav apps in my vehicles. One of my vehicles, a Subaru has wireless charging. There is no way to disable this in the phone or in the vehicle if you put the phone in the spot where it exists. This is the normal way to integrate Android Auto with the car's media system.The phone discharges faster than it charges while driving. The phone gets blistering hot with wireless charging (not on cable charging) and also Android Auto apparently drops operation if there isn't a cell signal. Car Play doesn't drop like this and I'm in a remote area with many cell coverage dead zones.I've swapped to using a cable to tether and charge in the car and so far it is not improving this issue. A long trip will mean the phone will die and I rely on the phone for navigation.I'll likely just put another RAM mount x-grip in this car to get it away from the wireless charging pad, but I'm not convinced the phone will charge fast enough to offset the running drain of the battery. I'll have to give it a try and see.Hopefully this will fix the issue, otherwise this phone will not work properly for vehicle nav and music use.They need to make it possible to turn off wireless charging, it's frustrating that this cannot be done.","July 18, 2024"

SD card was great to be able to add more space when you download movies from apps.  No Headphone port, which has come in handy on OLD devices that only support aux inputs.The AI features are neat, but not all that useful. Maybe if you need to translate languages often. I'm not sure why the AI stuff can't be applied to any other phone, since a lot of it is offloaded to the cloud anyway.Seems to be an S23 with some software that could also work on the s23.  Feels like a step backward from an older S10, which had curved edges, headphone and SD card ports.

Even at full volume, music playing from this phone is not nearly as loud as my old phone.  I see from the Samsung website that others have the same complaint.  I've shared this with Samsung.  Hopefully it's something that can be addressed with a software patch and not a hardware issue.  If anything changes in this regard, I'll update my review.Update: got an unhelpful response from Samsung yesterday.  Today, I tried listening to music through earbuds instead of using the phone speakers.  The left channel is almost completely muted.  I checked the equalizer and it's set for even distribution between left and right channels.  I've let Samsung know about this.  We'll see what happens.Update 2: Samsung tells me they've raised the issue w/their developers for further evaluation.  Meanwhile, I've noticed a second issue.  The screen flickers when I scroll with my finger.  This happens with all the applications on my phone. I've reported this to Samsung as well.Update 3: I've discovered the problem with the left channel.  The problem wasn't in the Equalizer.  In Settings > Accessibility > Hearing enhancements, the balance was incorrect.  I've corrected that, and now the sound is great with my earbuds. However, the loudness and sound quality through the phone speakers still are inferior to my S10e.","February 1, 2024"
2143,SAMSUNG Galaxy S24,Lissette Collahuazo,1,"My first smart phone was a small Samsung which I enjoyed and decided to give the brand a try again. There are plenty of things I didn't enjoy, but here are the top 3:1. The quality of the design has really gone down. If you hold it with your left hand, your fingers will be covering the cameras (why do they need 3 of them to be placed on top of one another?). They removed the 3.5mm jack so you can't just plug a wired headphones. You have to buy an adapter for the usb-c port which means you can't listen to music and video and charge it at the same time, e.g. when in a car.2. Why remove the option to schedule a phone turn on time. Similarly, why can't I turn off the phone at night (e.g. if I wanted to avoid disturbance and radiation) and have the alarm work with the phone off? Why can't that be an option like on other phones?3. The biggest headache I had is with transferring the data from my old phone. Why was the sd_card_backup file from the previous phone hidden? Who really needs the option in the file folders that switches between Essential/All files? Why would Samsung decide which files are essential? Even if you need the button for some reason, why leave the default to Essential (which hides the files you have downloaded and leaves the Samsung factory files)?I will postpone buying a new phone for as long as I can, and I'm not buying a Samsung phone anymore.","July 28, 2024"

2178,SAMSUNG Galaxy S24,Johnny Homes,4,"Though I got my s24 Through T-Mobile.And I only 128gb Space for the time being.Mostly due to the fact of price and expense and also because I needed a phone because my old one was breaking, I've only had it for a few days. I can already tell you period. The space gets eaten up really fast, even though they tell you it doesn't, The battery does not last as long as they say it does. I can barely get mine to last a few hours to a day.And it's mostly due to all the c*** that they download onto it like most phones, they have all this extra stuff they need to put on to the phone, to protect it. And you have to go through the phone. To take off a bunch of stuff that you know the phone doesn't need just so that you have space to put stuff on your phone, that you may or may not want. Or you end up having to go out if you're able to.To get a drive, this phone, unfortunately, does not have the ability To take an extra drive space, which sucksSo I recommend being careful with the space you've got. Something.The store did not tell me when I got the phone. Also, make sure that when and if you get your plan, that is the plan you want, because they have a bad habit of not paying attention or listening and just doing what they like, I had to go back and speak to customer service when I got home and change my plan to something I could afford. Because the store put me on something.I couldn't. From what I can tell the responsiveness to pretty much, most of the stuff on the phone, it's okay, some of the things when it comes to the gaming experience can be a little lag and a little slow.Charging is pretty quick, but like I said, the battery goes pretty fast.Period the camera seems to work. Okay. I've used it a couple times just to use it for rudimentary stuff around the house, just to give it a checkover.I haven't really tried it out for larger things, at least not yet.I'll probably do that a bit later on when I have something big.I know more than likely. I probably won't be holding onto this phone very long. It was just a temporary fix until I can get something that might hold me up a bit better as I planned on getting something with larger space.And most definitely better battery. I will definitely need something that can hold an sd card.","July 18, 2024"

2180,SAMSUNG Galaxy A54,Curtis Sine,5,"Am not a power user or someone who lives on their phone. So can't rate the hi tech features. Phone is mostly for occasional or emergency use, and don't much care about camera capabilities. My last phone was a budget phone, so this was a quantum leap upgrade. This one seems to first and foremost to have MUCH better reach to the tower, granted the 5G capability likely has something to do with that. First cell phone ever which works at my house, and I'm using the cheapest service provider there is here in the States, which I can't name here. Battery charges up fast, standby time is a lot better than my old phone ever was when new.Touch screen when scrolling and virtual keyboard and reorientation is snappy. Really like the adaptive brightness. Know most all phones now have wi-fi enabled calling, even my old phone once did but when changed service providers they no longer supported on the antiquated handset. Wi-fi enabled calling works GREAT on this phone. When my antiquated DSL isp was down recently, I actually used the 5G Samsung A54 as a hotspot for my computer.Like the size, personally find the glass back to be very slippery, I'd been just as happy with a hi quality plastic back.One thing worth noting is Samsung promises upgrades for several years. This was a new phone model in March of 2023, AND Amazon offered a 90 day return policy. Very important as needed to make sure would work with my service provider. Thought was they might need to send a new SIM card, and by that time return window could close. Happily, no problems old SIM card plugged right in, and presto phone was working within minutes.Also for a great price, this is brand new handset, not one which was supposedly ""refurbished"", used, customer return whatever.  Has a recent Android version, so wasn't buying some phone already out of date when I got it, like my last one was. (Samsung Galaxy J3, was a good little phone for the money and served well).Note the charger brick is not included, although the type C charging cable is. Most people probably have a spare charger or two laying around, but not in my case. Work around was: used the AC adapter for my MacBook Pro until got to the store and picked up a charger brick for the type C cable. Also got a legacy USB2 cable to Type C usb cable which allows the use of older AC charger bricks or older car cigarette lighter adapters.All in all two thumbs up, I mean what is not to like!","January 23, 2024"

2182,SAMSUNG Galaxy A54,Curtis Sine,4,"I am not a fan of spending on $1000 on something that has to be replaced every few years.  So, I buy midrange phones, keep them until they're not longer secure or the battery starts to choke.This is a much better phone than the price suggests.  Decent camera, good features, and a nice, snappy, responsive interface.  Also love the fact that these still take an microSD card.I didn't realize until I was done that they provided a transfer cable to move data from my old phone to my new one.  I also didn't realize the transfer software copied everything from my old SD card, which was unnecessary and took a lot of time.I would have given it 5 stars except for a few things:1. No headphone jack2. The fingerprint reader can be kind of iffy3. Samsung keeps nagging me to get an account on their cloud and use it for backups.  Why?  That's what Google is for.  I don't need more snoopers on my machines.Overall a good, practical phone for everyday business use.","April 8, 2024"
2183,SAMSUNG Galaxy A54,r2,5,"I got this phone after my iPhone XR broke and so I was a bit hesitant to switch over to android but I do not regret it. I'll make this to the point so I don't waste your time.Pros:- Battery life: I've had the phone for about 2 months now so I can't speak too much on the degradation but the battery on this is very good. On a full charge this will last me pretty much all day with maybe about 10-20% left at night with heavy usage. If you don't plan on using this phone all day you will be more than fine with the battery on this thing.- Multitasking: I can run multiple apps on this thing with no problems at all. I think the only time the phone might be overworked would be if you were video editing or gaming plus also trying to run something else at the same time but i'm not sure who would even do that lol.-Screen: The screen quality of this phone and with the high refresh rate makes it great for viewing at all times. I will say on a very sunny day you will have to turn the brightness all the way up to see but apart from that I have no complains about the screen for this phone and I think at this price range you won't find much better.Cons:- Camera: Now this one is definitely debatable as i've seen some people like and dislike the camera on here but for me I just feel like it's lacking in certain areas. The selfie camera is usable but coming from the iPhone I felt like it was pretty much the same with a little worse video quality. I will say the portrait mode on the camera is really good and the main camera is generally very good for the price, although zooming in at all past 2x will be pretty bad image/video quality. I do want to reiterate though this might depend on your preferences so id encourage to go find camera comparisons out there but I think for casual photography/video taking and with good lighting the camera will get the job done.-Finger print reader: Outside of the camera this was my only other nuisance with the phone, and don't get me wrong this is a first world problem but sometimes the finger printer reader lags behind or I need to get a good finger placement on it. It's not the biggest deal in the world but it can be a bit annoying having to scan my finger multiple times to get through. I don't use facial recognition so I can't speak on that but for the finger print reading it's definitely not as responsive as the higher end Samsung phones.Overall there is very little complains I have about this phone and I think for anyone who's looking for just general phone use you won't get much better than this and you're getting a phone with a reliable brand in Samsung so in case something happens it will be serviceable easier than maybe some other international brans out there.","May 21, 2024"
2184,SAMSUNG Galaxy A54,Ham Burger,5,"First I tried a Pixel 7a, because I liked the typical Google enhancements. The fingerprint sensor, and modem were supposed to be improved over my old Pixel 6, but sadly, I didn't see it. That is when I decided to try this A54. While it may not be quite as fast as the Pixel, and it doesn't have voice type, or phone monitoring, it is an extremely well-balanced phone. It feels premium, and the software has a very smooth fluid feel to it. Also, the fingerprint scan has never failed me, and the cell signal is about 10% better than both the Pixel 6, and 7a. The bonus is that I got it on Prime Day and saved about $130. Features are nice, but reliable unlocking, and great cell signal with a smooth OS are priceless.Update 8/26/23: I've had this phone for a tad over 5 weeks now, and it is getting to be my favorite phone I've had. It is very smooth, super reliable, and does everything I need. On paper, this phone is no powerhouse compared to flagships, but I don't miss the extra power one bit. I'm not a gamer but I play games and I'm not a photographer but I shoot very nice pictures. Not once have I missed the extra power. That said, my biggest complaint with Pixels was the biometric security. Fingerprint sensors, and face recognition for me was 85%. This A54 has never failed to open on the first try since I've had it. Like I said, if you want the fastest phone this isn't it, but pleasingly fast everyday use doesn't always mean the latest processors.","July 19, 2023"
2185,SAMSUNG Galaxy A54,M S,1,"This is the first time I've splurged and bought a genuine Samsung Galaxy. I expected to be delighted, and I was at first. The phone lived up to the hype I'd read in reviews. Bright , colorful screen, good cameras, efficient design. But by the time I finished setting it up, I realized the battery was draining super fast. I can't use the phone for more than 3 or 4 hours before the battery drains. I called Samsung, and a very helpful technician diagnosed by remote control, concluding nothing was wrong in software or settings, suggesting the battery must be defective.That where the helpfulness ended. Neither Samsung nor Amazon will replace the phone. Samsung washes their hands of responsibility short of directing me to a location an hour away where a technician might be able to repair the phone. Of course, repair is unacceptable. I ordered a new, perfect phone, and that's what I deserve to have. There's supposed to be a 14-day replacement policy, according to Samsung, but I have to get that from Amazon. Amazon will not replace the phone, saying only, ""we don't have that option in our system."" They want me to mail it back and have it ""evaluated by a technician"" for possible refund of replacement. Imagine my shock that they won't just send me a new phone.I called Samsung back, and they refuse to help in any way. They aren't even listening to me. I just spent 20 minutes telling a customer care rep the whole story (for the tenth time) and even though I specified repeatedly that I bought the phone from Amazon, he ended the call by telling me one of the reasons he couldn't help me is that he doesn't know from whom I bought the phone. Needless to say, I will never buy another Samsung product. I can also say I'm dismayed and angry that Amazon doesn't have my back. I've spent hours on the phone today trying to have a defective phone replaced, and I've got nothing to show for it, other than a defective phone that won't hold a charge.","July 8, 2023"

2187,SAMSUNG Galaxy A54,JAmes Finn,5,"I needed to replace my Galaxy A30s international model phone after about 4 years; as one of the budget phones in the Galaxy line, the A30s offered dual sim capability, but I had to buy an international model with no US warranty to get that flexibility. Shame on Samsung US for not offering that phone!The A54 5g phone for the US offers both eSIM and physical SIM capability, so we can travel abroad without have to physically remove our US SIM. We use Consumer Cellular, which resells AT&T (and used to resell T-Mobile). The A54 5g is priced a bit higher than the A30 series, but still far less than the top end domestic offerings. Who needs to pay $1,000 for a phone? Every few years? Really?My wife bought the A54 5g when it was introduced on the Consumer Cellular website; it was a great introductory buy at $300. I bought this for a bit more, and only within the last few months. Still, there isn't a better (my opinion) mid range phone available on the market (well, the US market, at least).We live in an almost dead zone, about 2 miles away in opposite directions from cell towers (and the digital coverage at our house is about 1 bar). Still, this phone makes and receives calls very well; we augment that by using WiFI calling through our Xfinity router. Call coverage is good.I preferred the A30s fingerprint reader, under the screen on the front, compared to on the side of this phone. ALso, unless you autolock the screen within about 5-10 seconds of last use, and happen to toss it into your pocket, you may find that the screen is so sensitive in your pocket that you will inadvertantly open the screen and exercise home screen icons, including the phone. Imagine my surprise when I got a call back from the 9-1-1 operator asking what my emergency was. Oops, pocket dial, my bad. So I've taken to a minimal active screen time and making sure the screen is black before I put the phone in my pocket. Other than that, no issues. Enjoy!","June 9, 2024"
2188,SAMSUNG Galaxy A54,TAZMANTIM,4,"I wanted a phone that functions well and provides me with value. I have no interest in having a mobile phone that is a status symbol or fashion accessory.  I'm an unoppressed minority...  one of the few that try to get as much life as possible out of my mobile phones and I think I found a good option here.For a mid-range smart phone, the camera is very competitive. Battery life is mediocre, although I do really like that I can cap the charging at 85% to extend the battery's lifetime. I also like that the operating system does seem to be managing app behaviors to improve battery life, although this feature does cause a few minor problems now and then.This is not my first Samsung phone. I moved away from Samsung years ago, mainly because their better phones dropped support for memory cards and because of the preinstalled bloatware. Some of the Samsung apps are very useful, other's not at all. I would prefer that the customer was given the option to install the apps from the Samsung store, rather than bog down the device with apps that never get used. I'm disappointed there is no headphone jack. This would be easier to swallow if Samsung included a USB C headphone adaptor - unfortunately that was not the case. And speaking of things not included... no charger is included. The lack of a charger didn't bother me though, since I have a large assortment of USB chargers and the phone does seem to take advantage of industry standard fast charging on the chargers that support this. The price tag made some really wild swings during the time I purchased. Fortunately, I was able to purchase at a low spot.In summary - The camera, the memory card slot, OS/security update support, and the price tag (at times) make this phone a winner in my opinion.","June 23, 2024"
2189,SAMSUNG Galaxy A54,Kindle Customer California,4,"So I've had a Galaxy S9 for a while even after their last update (The last update for the S9 was March of 2022) but my phone was getting pretty slow an some apps were not functioning right, not to mention the battery life was draining faster due to so much use, while I could still talk, text an go on socials I felt like it was time especially since the phone would not get anymore security updates of sorts.  I was planning on the previous S20 series or a oneplus 12r since it was more affordable than the s24 but realized I don't use my phone to the fullest... just talk, text an youtube (I don't play games or anything else) So I went budget an got this one instead!  (not to mention the 12R only gets 3 years of updates while the a54 gets 5 as of release... also the camera is a nice upgrade bonus even though I don't take much pictures or record... The only real problem i've had with this phone is the fingerprint reader, the bottom of the phone screen is used to read registered finger prints and so far it works find for unlocking your phone but some apps that have the option will not register the fingerprint, my bank app has a finger reader an when I put my finger on the phone to scan it will read it but nothing will happen so I end using a password instead.  Its not really a big deal unless you use fingerprints a lot but otherwise its fine for just unlocking your phone!So if you don't really use your phone like a maniac an wanna save money this one is pretty much worth it especially for a budget level phone!","February 12, 2024"
2190,SAMSUNG Galaxy A54,Curtis Sine,4,"First order, order information said it was a new phone, but received a used phone instead. Returned it and tried again. The seals on the second phone's box were cut, but the phone itself was still sealed and unused. I decided to keep it. Sounds like someone has mixed the used phones with the new wherever these ship from. Although not the phone's fault, I took a star for this.As for the phone itself, I'm very happy. This was the only phone I could find that still supported SD card storage. I have too much data for cloud storage and I'm not pleased with the current trends in phones where features are taken while the prices rise.The phone works very smoothly. I haven't taken a bunch of pictures yet, but the few that I have look great. My old phone was 4G. The upgrade to 5G is a big improvement. Everything about the phone works so much better than my old Motorola G Power. I have no doubt this phone will last me for years. I give the phone itself 5 stars.","March 15, 2024"
2191,SAMSUNG Galaxy A54,JAmes Finn,5,"Samsung A54 5G has a camera rated among the best in 2023.  A couple of professional reviews thought that the color rendering was too vivid; however, I found that the A54’s display settings can be changed from “vivid” to “natural” so the reviewers may have been looking at the vivid rather than the natural display setting.  I’ve yet to find out how my photos look on my laptop or other display, however.For me, the A54’s competition was the Pixel 7/7A or I could have waited for the Pixel 8.  When I made my purchase, the 7A was $100 more than the A54.  I would have paid more for an arguably better phone whose camera can make blurry photos sharper; however, the 7/7A has an issue with spontaneous lens shatter, also an issue with the preceding Pixel 6/6A, and I didn’t anticipate it being fixed in the Pixel 8.  I could imagine being on vacay and no longer able to take pictures, a total bummer since I’m such a shutterbug.  BTW, during my last vacay I took most of my pix with a DSLR that has a fairly decent 18 MP resolution.  The A54’s main camera has 50 MP, so my DSLR is in danger of gathering dust in the closet, if you know what I mean.Now on to the phone (sorta joking about buying a camera that makes phone calls).  Since Verizon has not great reception in my apartment building, I was concerned about whether my new phone could do Wi-Fi calling or whether I would have to go outside in the winter to talk on the phone.  Answer:  Yes, the A54 can make Wi-Fi calls with Verizon!  So far, crystal clear call quality with some intermittent static.The A54’s user interface is very intuitive, easier than my work phone (iPhone 11) or even my old Samsung S7.  There were some preloaded apps that I don’t need, so I just removed them.There is some flak these days about cell phones having a USB C data cable, no charging plug, and no earphones.  I already have many charging plugs and ear phones, bought an inexpensive USB C-to-USB adapter for the data/charging cable, and plan to buy a USB C-to-headphone jack adapter rather than ear buds.I set up fingerprint unlock, which works fine.  I will probably set up face recognition as well.Even if I had paid more than $349 (the S7 was $400 in 2017), I would still be completely satisfied with my A54 and highly recommend it!","September 2, 2023"

After reading so many conflicting reviews, I gave up and went to Samsung's website to verify this phone. They stated that it does support two Sim cards. One reviewer said he returned his phone when it did not have a second sim card slot.Here's the thing, it has the standard pop out SIM and SD card holder that most phones have AND it has a built in eSIM. Both the SIM & eSIM have an IMEI, those numbers never change, like serial numbers.The way the second sim card, the eSIM is activated is through your carrier. They can generate a QR code for you to scan or you can type it in. It takes several steps with the SIM Manager. Your carrier can also cancel the QR code and re-issue it.They were not familiar with this particular model and it took several tries for them to get mine to work.It took several days to get it done so if you are in a hurry to have service I would suggest using the physical SIM first.Mine already had my primary cell number working and the eSIM is where I had my land line ported.So, yes, I have two numbers working on my Galaxy A54 5G, both are local numbers here in the US.My overall impression of the A54 is that it is full of apps that will serve no purpose for my needs but it is a solid well put together phone. I do 99% of my work on a PC and the phone is when needed. It will take a while for me to get familiar with the phone and determine which apps running in the background can be removed or turned off. I think that should help out with the battery life. It's not bad but it isn't as good as the battery life on my Motorola Moto, that would last three days or longer.Bottom line is I would probably purchase this phone again. Don't ask about pictures and video, I haven't had a chance to try them out but they are known to be top notch.","December 21, 2023"
2193,SAMSUNG Galaxy A54,DIANE M DONOVAN,5,"I have a $35 15GB 5G prepaid plan with Verizon.  All I did was moving the SIM card from Note 5 which is no longer getting updates since 2018.  I'll show you howto self activate at the end.  9 out of 10 apps on Note 5 are no longer supported by play store lol.  What a big noticeable change.  I was worried this is going to be a waste of money, used returned beaten up item, and negative reviews left on CDMA carrier like Verizon, nah I'm like a little kid on Xmas eve again.  I bought this on Cyber Monday deal *used like new condition* with 20%, warehouse deal out of the door was 270.  Was it a gamble?  Yes, lucky hit.  Everything works as advertised.  So far could not tell why this phone was returned.  It doesn't appeared to be used at all.  80% battery power appears to be default so I don't think last user even turned it on.  Spent about an hour got all the updates all the way up to Nov 1st patch, still waiting for UI6/Android14 - updates dropped me to 60% power - how nice, can't say the same thing with my old note 5.  I can't speak for other carrier but Verizon is notorious for dropping call priority once you've used your SIM card past 18 months.  If you've used it past 18 months, do exactly as I'm telling you.  Go to a Verizon store with your old phone, tell them excuse me I've had this SIM card for the past 18 months and I'm getting call delay.  They will give you a free brand new SIM card, make sure it said 5G on it.  I don't think they have any more 4G sim so you don't need to worry and also not worry if your old phone takes 5G or not - SIM cards are backward compatible.  Have them install the SIM card, make sure it works on your old phone.  Great go home, open your new A54 swap out the SIM card right away hahah enjoy :)","December 1, 2023"
2194,SAMSUNG Galaxy A54,Don Forgash,4,"The A54 phone is a good middle of the road phone for those who do not want all the bells and whistles of the more expensive models.  I have used the 5G functionality when it is available.  The phone is much faster than my previous phone and takes better pictures.  I can easily get though the day on a single charge (maybe 2 days if the phone is not used a lot).There are a couple of negatives.  One being that it takes a much longer time for the phone to power on if I turn it off or restart it.The other negative (a major one for me) is the swipe functionality when sending  a text.  The phone almost always picks up the wrong word that I am trying to type.  It also does not seem to ""learn"" (that is remember the words that I have type before).  It is so bad that at times, I just manually type the text letter by letter.So great for phone calls and pictures, but a lot to be desired for texting (my previous Motorola model was much better with the texting functionality).","February 1, 2024"

It also easily has a full day of battery life.The bad news (well, not really news) is that Samsung has done the typical anti-consumer thing that nearly every other manufacturer has been doing since Apple found their ""courage"": removed the universally standard headphone jack without any good reason for doing so (other than to save a few pennies per unit, presumably). There's no excuse for removing a standard port, unless it allows an obvious and significant improvement, like waterproofing (which this phone lacks).","August 2, 2024"

2200,SAMSUNG Galaxy A54,Curtis Sine,3,"I bought this phone for one and only reason - to use the esim functionality to use overseas when I travel.However this version for some reason has an important option missing from the settings. All of the manuals online, Samsung etc show that in the Sim Manager, there is a Preferred SIM Card setting. So if you are using two sims, a physical one and an e-sim, you can use the settings to set which card does calls, which does sms, and which does data.That's very important when going overseas. You still need to receive calls on your physical sim, but set the esim to use Airalo or similar for roaming data.EXCEPT - these settings are MISSING from this version of the phone. It may be restricted somewhere, but after hours on chat with Samsung support, they tell me this exact model of the phone doesn't come with that option.So if you want to use it overseas with an esim for roaming, the functionality is severly restricted by not being able to choose which sim is for calls and which sim is for data. This should have been made clear in the item description, as this phone is not fit for the purpose I bought it for.Too late to return it by the time I worked it out.","May 4, 2024"

There is a FULL range of adjustments; every App I wanted to add loaded smoothly, the battery life lasts all day. The camera works fine; but by no means compares to a high end Apple phone. If you’re wanting a very high quality camera this is not the phone for you. But all the other features work really well. Excellent phone for the money & 5G.

2204,SAMSUNG Galaxy A54,will,3,"This is my first Samsung phone, but we do use Samsung tablets that we really like.  I did not want to replace our phones; the older Motorola and Lg phones were wonderful, but I got really sick of the vendors not updating them after two years.  That, and around 3 years in, the phones always seem to start developing mysterious issues that they never had before (e.g, needing frequent restarts to get the audio to work) - just like the vendor is trying to force you to buy something new.  I really do not like that.The main draw here, besides good ratings, was the promise that the software would be updated for FOUR years.I'm not really all that impressed.  Maybe it is just getting used to something different, but I do find many things missing compared to the same priced phones from Motorola and LG.  For example, the phone does not have a proximity detector or a metal detector, and the disgusting nag software that is included from Samsung really ticks me off.  Taking a long time to weed it out.  There are some nice new features too, so it is not all bad, just not as good as I had expected.One of the most irritating things is that you often cannot just tap a ""button""; instead, you have to hold on it and swipe some direction.  Two really annoying places this shows up is when the phone rings, and you have two buttons available - one to answer and one to reject.  No instructions on the screen at all, but neither button works unless you tap/hold/swipe Up.  My Motorola phone shows just one button, and you swipe up to answer and down to reject, but the key is that it TELLS you that right on the screen!Another even worse situation is when the calendar sends you an alert, and the big ""Dismiss"" button on the bottom does NOTHING at all!  I am still not sure what works to actually dismiss those alerts - after a few minutes of tapping, screaming, cussing, etc., I just hide the phone under a pillow and leave the room.  I do not know if any of these issues are specific to all Samsung phones or just this A54, but either way it makes me wish I  had not bought it.","August 6, 2023"

2206,SAMSUNG Galaxy A54,karla coley,4,I hadn't  bought a phone since 2020.  I had 3-4 Motorola phones in a row because they are almost pure android and they have some nice options.  The last was a Moto G Power.  The battery life was great but like all phone batteries it got weaker over 3 years.  Motorola also only gives 2 years of updates which I don't  like.Now for the Samsung.  It has enough bells and whistles I  am still learning.  The phone is much quicker than my old phone but we will see how it is in 3 years.  If I  am not mistaking they give 5 years of updates.I don't see the need for a high end phone for me so I  look for medium priced phones.  I would suggest this phone.  The only drawback is the battery isn't as good as my Moto Power when it was new.  This is a more powerful phone so that might be part of it.I consider it a good buy for the money.,"November 4, 2023"

Didnt make a difference.I setup phone to use fingerprint scanner when screen is off.After phone as been idle a few hours, every time I go to use scanner.Its no longer there, I have to use my 4 digit pin to get in phone.After using the phone and turning it off the scanner is back again.This phone costs too much for things like this to happen.On just a 5 watt charger this phone charges real fast.My experience has been when that happens the battery is old and failing.This is the way all my other phones worked.They took a long time to charge when new.Next phone I need I'm not sure what brand Ill buy.As poor as the battery is in this one it might be sooner than later.","January 16, 2024"
2208,SAMSUNG Galaxy A54,Kirk,4,"I had been using a Amazon Renewed S22 256GB the past two weeks, it was listed in like New condition and was $480. I got this A54 since it was the same price, but there are some major difference.First off, if you can get an almost like new S22 for under $500, you will have a much faster phone, smoother UI experience, better quality picture, better looking display that can get brighter. The A54 has a slightly larger screen, but since it's the same FHD+ resolution, it's actually a lower DPI and text doesn't look as good. The camera on the A54 is good, but the S22 is better if you can get it for under $500. Both phones have good call quality, but the Speakerphone on the A54 has more speaker distortion at max volume than the S22. I do like that the A54 has a 5000mah battery to last longer. But the major advantage of the A54 vs the S22 (besides the battery) is that the A54 has a microSD card slot! There is no reason why Samsung can't include this on the S series, as the S20 was rhe last to have the memory card slot.So the summery is, if you specifically want a good mid range phone, the A54 is a good choice, and you have a larger battery with microSD support. But if you want a better (higher end) phone, then look for a like-new renewed S22 for the same price. Between the two, I preferred the S22.","April 11, 2023"

But my previous phone, S6, was rugged, thin and capable of being dropped without worry. I bought two of these on prime day, one of them had been opened before because there was a sticker removed from the box and there was a very small scratch on the screen. I really don't want to deal with replacing it so I kept it. The phone does not come with a charger! It says it in the description so be sure you buy a USB-C with the right wattage.As far as the bloatware and spyware goes, it comes with a lot of it. You will need to download a program called ""platform tools"" to get rid of it. There are a lot of youtube videos and instructions available on how to use it and what to remove. But if you do this, you will have a quality phone that doesn't do creepy things without your consent. The battery was draining pretty quickly before I did this as well, so you must do this part. This is a requirement for almost any phone you get.I spent 4 days without needing to charge my phone with light use. It was about 30%. So the battery is pretty reasonable. Get a screen protector, USB-C charger with appropriate wattage and if you must, a protective case. The USB cable is very short, if you need longer consider getting one as well.","July 24, 2023"

It does what I need and some of my apps are happier. The fingerprint reader is hit or miss so that's frustrating sometime. I need to  program my thumb now. Other than all the things that need getting used to with a new phone (new sounds, new messaging, some lost contacts from not backing up often) I'm happy with this phone It communicates well with my Subaru Android system.

2217,SAMSUNG Galaxy A54,AmazonJunky,2,"Initially I would have rated it A-54 5G much higher, but when Samsung pushed back-to back software updates within the past several weeks, they destroyed some of the key features/functions that I used regularly.  The sleep mode suddenly stopped working, which should have silenced all notifications and calls after the times I set. It worked before the updates, but not anymore.  Then, Some text notifications were muted and others weren't - it was totally random. And despite spending hours on the phone with their tech support teams, the problems only got worse after another update was pushed out about a week ago.  Now I have a floating bubble on the home page over new text messages I rec'd.  And the other issues never got resolved.I spoke with 3-4 different tech's (all of who could barely speak understandable English) after combined hours trying to fix the problems, which they still haven't done, they all used the same tactic - do a reset while on a remote connection to my phone with their (not so) Smart Tutor app.  And it also severed the phone connection when it turned off & restarted.  And even though they all asked for phone number so they could call me back after being disconnected, NOT ONE of them did. They all disappeared, never to heard from again - not a single one of them.I will never buy another Samsung product, not just because of the technical issues, which all phones & mobile devices have at some point, but also because of how their tech 'experts' pulled a vanishing act when they finally realized they couldn't fix the problems.  It's pathetic and for anyone who is considering buying a Samsung phone, I would caution you to think twice and shop other brands also.  I foresee a Google Pixel phone in my near future.Samsung, you should be very ashamed of how your company deals with technical support problems.","March 1, 2024"

She lives in the Philippines, wanted something factory unlocked and has a good battery. Saw so many reviews for this, but sadly as soon as I got everything set up, (just a few days ago since I went to vacation to visit her with mom) it didn’t want to connect to her sim. She has Smart or Globe SIM card (Pre Paid). For some reason it wouldn’t connect to Wi-Fi ether. She cried when I had to take it back with me. Oh well. I’ll buy her another when I visit her again but from over there not on here.Just letting you know you may experience something different.

2240,SAMSUNG Galaxy A54,Curtis Sine,4,"*Updated May 2023* Turns out Verizon goofed when setting up my plan, it simply took two in-person reps and a tech support person to diagnose the issue.  Up and running now.That said, I have found the touchscreen to be overly sensitive at times.  It will think I tapped on a link or such when I didn't.  Also, I have yet to figure out the setting to preview my notifications in full when on lock screen; something I was able to do on my old S10, but can't locate the setting on the A54.Great battery...easily made it a day and a half, but that's with my usage, which may be less than others.","May 15, 2023"

2242,SAMSUNG Galaxy A54,ignax00,2,"Pros: The phone is fast. It's a good deal for a budget phone. IT COMES WITH AN SD CARD SLOT! The camera is really nice. I can put tons of apps on here and not have to worry about space.Cons: TONS of unnecessary in-your-face bloatware. I mean tons. Even if you are texting Samsung tries to get in your face. This will be my last Samsung Product. If you buy this, you will spend hours uninstalling crap and Samsung will still ask you to store your passwords or use their cloud. It's unacceptable and I absolutely regret this purchase. I gave Samsung one more chance and they burned me.To be fair, it's not Samsung's fault. I knew what they were about and went with them anyway, because I wanted the SD card. Which it does have!! (Hence 2 stars)The worst part is the screen unlocks randomly. Think about that. If my phone is protected by face recognition, fingerprint, and PIN how is it unlocking in my pocket? If someone wants to break into my phone and steal my info all they have to do is put my phone in their pocket and walk around? Not acceptable. It's an invasion of my privacy.I work nights, someone I haven't talked to in 10 years received 4 random texts from me at 3:30 AM. That was embarrassing.Don't go with Samsung.

No where in the description can I find that it is stated that it doesn't support wireless charging. I thought my charging pad wasn't working until I placed an older phone on it and it was charged properly.

2255,SAMSUNG Galaxy A54,CFrizz,2,"My wife and I bought these phones as replacements for our 2 year old Pixel 5a phones after her 5a died. I used this phone for a week before returning it due to all the issues I was experiencing with it. I used it on a week of work travel so I got to experience it in variety of environments, including at home. I found the A54 to be very glitchy, lots of problems getting apps to work correctly or at all. Spotify would play 2-4 songs and then freeze, I would have to restart the app before it would work again. My American Airlines app glitched out, wouldn't load boarding passes and refused to work until I restarted the phone, almost missed my flight on that one. Many issues with Google maps. No amount of phone restarts or app reinstalls seemed to correct any of these issues. The camera was extremely disappointing, the pictures were honestly terrible compared to my 2 year old pixel. I will say the display brightness, clarity and 120hz refresh were excellent.Maybe I got a lemon, but overall switching back to my old pixel 5a, my 2 year old pixel feels like a much better phone to me.","December 23, 2023"

If I had known this I would not have purchased it.,"January 9, 2024"
2261,SAMSUNG Galaxy A54,JAmes Finn,3,"I use WiFi most of the time and my WiFi access is WiFi 6. WiFi 6 has been around since 2019 so it is hardly a new technology. The A54 5G repeatedly drops WiFi 6 connections even though all of my other phones hold it stable. I tried all of the usual remedies: Updates, Factory Reset, More Updates, different SIM, tried another A54 5G, nada, no joy! In most other respects the phone performed well. I found an article on the internet that the very same problem with WiFi 6 was happening with the S23 series. The article was several months old and one of the other phones I have is an S23 Plus and it held its connection to WiFi 6 stable. So it is possible that in a few months, this problem might be fixed in some kind of update. But for now, I had to return the phone.","August 2, 2023"

I was in process of talking on phone it started to get hot in my hand then phone shut off and restarted on its own all apps gone again.

My previous phone was a Moto G7 plus, which is only a couple years old, but I couldn't get clear calls even though my T=Mobile signal was 4 bars or more, and wifi sucked as well. It was time to move to 5G apparently, because the Samsung works flawlessly,  I can actually understand people when they call, the texts come thru in a reasonable amount of time, and it functions very well.

2265,SAMSUNG Galaxy A54,Yulow,3,I have came back to Samsung after 2+ years with a OnePlus. I mainly got sick of the bad camera on the OnePlus so the return to Samsung solved that issue. The immediate value is on the fabulous screen and pleasant interface. The sound quality is also great although no traditional headphone jack was a bummer. The interface is pleasant but I personally like OnePlus better in ways. The camera is good but I would fault the focus and the image detail isn't like say an iPhone. The biggest downsides are the very slow charging and the bulk of the phone. It was like going backwards 2 or 3 years compared to my super fast charging and lightweight OnePlus. By the time you put this phone in a decent case it's a real heavy chunk.,"July 12, 2023"

I after many hours was able to managed it I believe it is a issue between Google and Samsung.That said I really like the phone and the most important why I bought a Samsung of other phones is Samsung has committed to 4 years of Android updates and 5 years of security patches.

2280,SAMSUNG Galaxy A54,Emily Melvin,5,"Okay, so, let's talk about this phone. I really needed a mid tier phone with a good quality camera. I take pictures of products for work and need stunning images, so this was the #1 most important feature to me... and I'm blown away. These are near-flagship quality images for a fraction of the price. Here are some images I took with it:1. A comparison between my older Moto G Stylus 5G (left) and the A54 (right). I consider the Moto G to have a pretty decent camera and I've taken some stunning shots with it, but this is a level up. Notice that the Moto G really struggles with underexposure of the subject when trying to compensate for the brightly lit window behind it. The A54 photo is definitely overexposed in that spot too, but the main subject doesn't lose any detail.2. Same 2 pictures but zoomed in. The loss of fine detail and underexposure is even more apparent in the Moto G Stylus photo. The A54 photo is crisp and retains some fine details here which is impressive.3. 3:4 50MP mode.4. Same photo, zoomed in. The resolution here is phenomenal. If you zoom in even further, you can see the individual pixels on the can label.5. Macro mode. Again the fine detail here is stunning.6-8: 3:4 50MP mode. Notice the clarity, fine detail, vividness and crispness of these images. I love how vivid the colors are.9. 32MP selfie camera. This camera is powerful and picks up details I'm not sure I even want it to, to be honest. Thankfully, though, it also has the skin smoothing effect to mitigate this. 32MP on a selfie camera in general is new to me and very impressive.Overall I give this phone's camera a 9.5/10. The only thing it lacks is a telephoto lens, but I wouldn't expect this in a $325 phone. Also, some of the images do come out slightly oversaturated which could be a problem if you want ""natural"" looking, slightly less vivid photos. Personally, though, I actually prefer this vibrant, enhanced look, so for my needs it's a straight up 10/10.Now that I've written an entire novel on this phone's camera, which is probably the most underrated aspect of anything in the world of consumer electronics today, let's talk briefly about the phone itself.1. I love that it's IP67 water resistant. I do not plan to test this, but I've ruined many phones by dropping them in the toilet or taking them in the rain so I like that I don't have to worry as much about that.2. Battery life is decent. Today, I charged it overnight to 100%. I had a video call with my therapist and after that I've been editing images on full brightness for a few hours. Then I wrote this review, which took like 45 minutes. I have not plugged it in again and at 4:30pm, I still have 68%. This is impressive.3. Love the size. My Moto G Stylus 5G was a bit too big to hold comfortably in my hand. This phone is just a tad bit smaller and easier to hold, but still has a big beautiful display.4. The awesome purple color is just the cherry on top of an amazing phone.Overall: Vastly underrated phone for a phenomenal price.","November 28, 2023"
2281,SAMSUNG Galaxy A54,Davy Jones,5,"Good quality up-to-date phone for 5G needs. Had the older A51 version and finally had to upgrade due to the network itself.

2282,SAMSUNG Galaxy A54,Emily Melvin,4,"My wife's old Galaxy S9+ was in terrible shape, so she is really happy about this upgrade. I just wanted to say that the A54 version WORKS ON SPECTRUM MOBILE. That was not totally clear when purchasing. Pro tip: if you're not sure, check the IMEI number printed on the box BEFORE OPENING. I was able to verify the IMEI number on Spectrum's website, and just swapping in her previous SIM card, everything worked. Since Spectrum uses the Verizon network, I assume this means it would also work with Verizon, but use the IMEI trick with any carrier to verify first. If you do not open the box, any necessary return should be easy.","February 11, 2024"

2284,SAMSUNG Galaxy A54,Erika Ovalle,5,"This is a great phone for someone who does not need all the bells and whistles of an S series phone, nor wants to pay to price for one.  Frankly, you won't notice what's missing. I will say, if having wireless charging is a deal breaker for you, this is not the phone for you, as it doesn't have it.  Like all Samsung phones it was a little annoying to set up with all the little settings you want to customize, but it's made infinitely easier with the Smart Switch app, which will move *most* of your apps and settings over.The camera is really great, sound quality for music and voice is good.  Some people have had difficulty hearing me when I have it on speaker, but I think that's more a deficit of the room I am in when using that method of calling.  Using an ear bud, or going into another room, solves that.  I'm still getting used to the feel of it in my hand, as it's a little thicker and squarer than the S series phones. It's not off-putting, though, just different.The lavender color makes it attractive and is only available in retail versions, not from your carrier or even Samsung itself.","December 5, 2023"

Everything works with no edge feature to make it hard to handle the phone, great battery life, crisp, easy to read screen, faster CPU, and more!

We don't use the facial recognition or fingerprint reader.When setting up the phone one of the first thing you're asked is to create a Samsung account.  I didn't want to do this, as we've got enough cloud accounts, and didn't want yet another 3rd party gathering information on our lives.  Unfortunately, the only way to automatically migrate your apps from your old phone to new is to use the Samsung Smart Switch app.  This surprised us... our older phones just used Google's cloud and restored beautifully.  I searched online for alternatives, but it appears you need a Samsung cloud account and this Samsung app to easily migrate apps, Samsung's ""skin"" software appears to have disabled the Google app backup/restore feature..  We had to manually install the apps instead.  Annoying, as migrating app data one at a time is tedious.I'd rate this phone 5 stars if it wasn't for the required Samsung cloud to migrate apps.  We will see in a few years if we'll stick with Samsung or go with another phone manufacturer.","April 7, 2024"

I'm not ""techy"" at all so it has been a real hassle when things even I could do fairly easily on old phone is now completely changed or non-existent now.  Probably due to Samsung's changing of standard Android apps (which apparently work quite well), from what I could find from on-line reviewers.  I wouldn't have bought a new one, but they 'force' you to when they stop 'supporting' your old one.","July 20, 2024"
2298,SAMSUNG Galaxy A54,Edzew Kurai,5,I bought the Galaxy A54 in January /24 and it has been the best phone I've had so far. I got the purple one and it looks exactly like the photo online. The battery seems to last more than 8 hours of use and it charges very quickly even while using it. All the features work great and the phone doesn't glitch at all and it isn't slow + has tons of storage space. The camera is very good with multiple options as well.,"May 11, 2024"
2299,SAMSUNG Galaxy A54,Davy Jones,4,Seems OK with some issues--can't lay it on a charger--must plug in only.  To shut phone off must hold down sound and off button.  This is difficult and may be due to case hindering buttons.,"April 2, 2024"

2301,SAMSUNG Galaxy A54,Davy Jones,5,I have never bought a refurbished phone before I was a little concerned how it would look and work. I was so happy when it arrived. It was in PERFECT CONDITION! Not a scratch on it and I love the lavender color.  It was also nice to be able to save a little bit of money and also have such a pretty phone.It was easy to set up and all my info from my old phone was quickly and easily transferred. I would definitely recommend this phone to others,"April 27, 2024"
2302,SAMSUNG Galaxy A54,Gene Rachiell,2,"I dont know if I got a defective phone or if there's a bug on this phone, specifically with regard to the microphone!Since day 1, I was told during phone or video calls that they either can barely hear me or that there's a strange echo or noise during my calls or that my talking goes in and out.  This is despite both our volumes and connections working very well.I have a feeling the phone I received was a previously returned phone because I noticed the clear tape around the phone edges seemed to be peeling in some areas when I unboxed the phone.I've tried everything I can to fix this Mic issue for the days I've had this phone!!  I mainly do Whatsapp video calls but also phone calls.  Also during video calls, my voice is not in sync with the video sometimes.  It has sometimes worked ok and then it randomly doesn't work again.I never had these issues withmy older S8+ Phone-  i switched back to talking on that phone and everything works well but they I use this A54 and the mic and sometimes video issue happens again!I also noticed that the video stabilizer for the camera is very blurry when you take video but when I turn that off, the video looks better.I dis what I could as some people also said doing the updates fixed their mic issue.  Its fully updated, I gave permissions for mic use, cleared the cache for whatsapp and other phone apps, restarted my phone, disabled Bixby Voice (which others say solved their mic issue), contacted Samsung Support- and the issue is still happening!So frustarting because I like this phone.Everything else on this phone works nicely but the most important thing- the mic and video issue during video calls and phone calls- is not working.Of course I'm returning this phone and I'm debating on whether I should buy this same model phone again or just get another type of phone.","March 21, 2024"

The photos are a bit saturated & over colorized but there's probably something I haven't set right. Battery takes longer to charge than my Moto but also lasts a lot longer! YAY!! I found very affordable ear buds at Target that connect well & sound good so that was a plus. All in all, working great & I feel it was a good purchase. Thank goodness because I sweated buckets deciding on a replacement phone!","March 12, 2024"

2306,SAMSUNG Galaxy A54,Carol in AZ,5,"Works great. I needed a phone immediately as my last phone (S10) fell and broke, and this one had fast shipping. It's specs aren't as high as the S23 but it's great. You won't notice much difference really, it's only a bit slower but it's doable. I love the purple color. My hands are small so it was uncomfortable and really slippery without a case, but I got a case immediately and it's more manageable to hold now.Battery life is absolutely amazing. I can't believe how great it is. And I use my phone HEAVILY. Watching videos, gaming, muli tasking with a billion tabs open and not once did my phone die on me. Had it for a month so far.","February 3, 2024"

2308,SAMSUNG Galaxy A54,Nicole,4,"It was time my husband and I changed wireless carriers in order to save some money each month.  I needed unlocked phones and selected this make and model due to the reviews and the fact that it was a well-known brand.  It's taking a bit of getting used to since our previous phones were another brand- and very old (for a cell phone).  We have had no issues with the setup.  The only thing I don't like is that it cannot be charged wirelessly.  Had I looked at the specs in more detail, I would have known that prior to the purchase.  I may not have chosen this model had I known that.  However, the phones charge up very quickly once plugged in.  Overall I like the phones and will make do without wireless charging.","July 18, 2023"
2309,SAMSUNG Galaxy A54,TheLittleMiss,5,"I made the switch to Samsung from Apple and will never be going back.  There is a bit of an adjustment period, but it is absolutely worth it. The amount of customization, especially related to notifications is amazing. I used to have an iphone 13 and can honestly say this phone is pretty on par with it, except for a few minor things. The phone vibration for notifications  is a little weak even on the highest setting, though I have gotten used to it.  The front facing camera is not as good as apple's, but I don't take any selfies so it's far from an issue for me. The back cameras seem to be much better than apple's though. Overall, for hundreds of $$ less than an iphone, it's an obvious choice.","November 21, 2023"
2310,SAMSUNG Galaxy A54,Emily Melvin,4,Works well. I feel this item should be no more the 200 tops. Nothing special. Heavy brick compared to my moto.,"February 12, 2024"
2311,SAMSUNG Galaxy A54,Davy Jones,5,"I've owned flagship Samsung and Apple phones, and I needed a backup phone as I don't have a landline.  This filled the bill nicely and a lot of the features are also on the Galaxy S23s,  Same camera app and One UI seems to be pretty much identical in setup in all their phones.  Frankly, I’m seriously considering getting another one of these (or whatever the latest model is) when it comes time to upgrade my iPhone.  Most of the extras on flagships on flagships I’ve owned get little or no use.  Especially when it comes to fancy cameras.The AMOLED screen is brilliant.  Bright and bold color.The frame on this phone is plastic, which is a bit disappointing, but I put the phone in a case anyway, so that’s moot.","November 8, 2023"
2312,SAMSUNG Galaxy A54,Amazon Customer,4,"The phone was bought to replace my old phone which shut down and wouldn't restart. I love the cool features on the SG A54 5g.The size is perfect for my hands and the storage capacity is a plus.One drawback that I found is that I have to charge the phone often, and I  was disappointed that no block is included with the phone. I would recommend this phone as a good purchase.","November 22, 2023"
2313,SAMSUNG Galaxy A54,Scott Beamer,4,"I have always enjoyed Samsung products. I wanted to get something for my significant other and stumbled across this phone. Out of the box, the phone looks great! It came brand new as it says and I found that as a great first impression. It has a couple of bugs, but that's to be expected with software. I overall loved this phone. It was a huge upgrade from my significant others last one! I would recommend this to anyone with a smaller budget range that still wants a good phone!","September 28, 2023"
2314,SAMSUNG Galaxy A54,Cherish Carter,5,"The Galaxy A54 5G smartphone is a terrific buy because it hits ALL the right performance sweet spots without breaking the bank. Although I also bought a new iPhone 15 (because I have to have both platforms, Apple & Android), the Galaxy A54 5G is my favorite of the two. It's bright, fast, loud, clear and it is a great TELEPHONE! Of course my new iPhone 15 is faster, and is also a great performer, it's TWICE as costly. Now, this Galaxy A54 5G is no iPhone 15 killer but, as far as an Android phone goes in my life, it's the PERFECT choice because of its price versus performance. A GREAT value! I bought THREE from Amazon!","November 15, 2023"
2315,SAMSUNG Galaxy A54,PrimalDelta,3,"My old phone was the galaxy S10e. Very basic phone, nothing fancy. However that phone was durable and well made. This phone is cheaply made. Feels like cheap plastic, easily slips out of hand if you don't have a phone case on it. It's a thicker phone so when it vibrates you hear the echo thru the phone. Seems to lag a lot especially when you've been using it for a while. Overheats easily. Also the screen seems to have a mind of it's own. If your just reading something suddenly your phone will be going to the webpage from an ad without you touching anything. The pros are good battery life so far. And it's a 5g phone. I guess the price to because I don't need a $1000+ dollar phone I just need the basics. But compared to my last phone the quality is definitely lacking. Lastly this phone isn't huge but it's a lot bigger than my last phone so holding it with one hand can definitely be uncomfortable after a while so a phone case and ring to hold the phone are a must.","August 17, 2023"

My Pixel 6 was very hard to see in the sun and shut down due to overheating at least twice. I have not had the issue with the Samsung phone as of this posting. The screen is bright and awesome! I can see this screen in the TX sun, which is a plus. Most days I finish the workday with 70-80% battery left. I am a very light phone user though, so keep that in mind. Also, I hate the default notification on the Apple phone so I stayed away from going that route. You can have custom Samsung themes which are pretty good.TL;DR Great, bright, screen in the TX sun ☀️ and long battery life! 🔋 unique themes 😎","August 16, 2023"

The past few phones I've gotten have been the more the ""affordable"" versions, which were ok and they did their job. But I decided to spend a little extra money this time and get the real deal. This phone does not disappoint. It has lots of storage space, runs fast, it is beautiful and this has to have the best phone cameras that I have ever used. It takes the most beautiful, hassle-free photos- one of which I just got printed onto a canvas for my parents. If I had to express one small drawback, it would be that the fingerprint sensor doesn't seem to like my fingerprint because it takes a few times for it to open; it might just be my calloused fingertip.

In my new house cellular coverage is bad. My zenfone couldn't handle calls well and wifi calling isn't supported. I bought the s23 for its wifi calling capabilties. But I don't need that. The antenna is strong enough and calls do not get interrupted. And then I have wifi calling as back up!. The phone is not bloated and is extremely fast. I was used to fingerprint sensor on the side but the S23 has sensor under the glass...and works faster. overall great experience and i am happy with this samsung s23 phone","March 31, 2024"

Significant improvement in features, performance, and camera quality.  I found voice recognition using apps like Google Maps and others to be highly accurate.  However, I find the accuracy of using Swype on the virtual keyboard to be much less accurate and a frustrating experience.  Battery life is fine for me as I've not had to worry about recharging during the day with normal usage.  Recommended: Solid smartphone overall, but not perfect all around.","July 20, 2024"

2389,Samsung Galaxy S23,Susan Esposito,4,"Switched from an iphone 8 plus  to the S23 (vanilla) due to the pricing vs iphone 14($799). Got this at $599 on prime day. Amazon's competitor also had a sale earlier in the year.  It is new, and when i registered with samsung said the warranty is good for a year. That means that this is really a new phone.  It is hard to tell these days which vendor is selling new, and which ones are used (climate pledge friendly...renewed :) .It is impossible to search for NEW .  That means that it is the US version phone (one sim slot, and one esim). I have not verified  esim.The audio through the bose soundlink is a little different from the apple sound. I am tinkering with the synthesizer(hard to find online examples). I cleared up the echo noises, but still need to work on the bass.  There is about a 30gb memory hogged up by samsung setup and bloatware.  Still having glitches with whatsapp history through the smartswitch  cable transfer.The camera is better than the iphone 8plus,  but not sure about it compared to more up to date phones. at 30 x  and a distance of 8 feet away,  the image is less detailed than if you are 3 feet away with normal zoom 1x. But at $599, it is great. I will have to learn this camera system better.  Minor video games, surfing will work for a day and a half(same as iphone 8 plus) playing candy crush saga, scrabble, solitaire. With a 25watt charger, it takes about 45 minutes to charge from 45% to full charge.  Wireless charging is slow with the phone case and wireless charger. 25 watt plugin and 10 wireless charger). Fingerprint works so so  (reset it when i put on a new screensaver ) and have not tried the facial recognition.  The touch times out after 5 attempts. setup the index finger and thumb for both hands. I bet if I go into the Samsung store, an app guru can clear  up most of the little gotchas.","July 25, 2023"

I am getting ready to list them for sale and just have a ONE IN ALL great phone.  VERY HAPPY CUSTOMER.,"June 26, 2024"
2391,Samsung Galaxy S23,Susan Esposito,4,"Needed a new phone after my last one ran out of security updates. I liked my previous Galaxy S10E and decided to stick to a straight upgrade. Bought on Prime Day for 50 dollars more than the MSRP of the (oversized and lower spec) S23FE.Unfortunately, it came with a dead pixel from the factory and needed the screen replaced. Warranty covered it, but still sucks that it slipped through QC.Since getting that sorted, I'm very happy with the phone. Battery life is great, transfer from my previous device was smooth, it seems to run games well if you care about that in a phone,Only other issue is that it charges very slowly, and my wireless car charger that worked with my S10E's fast charging is apparently not compatible with the S23's fast charging. Not sure what changed there. No charger is included.5 years of security updates should get me well into 2028, by which point the EU's new rules requiring user-replaceable batteries will have kicked in and affected manufacturing worldwide, so now it's just a matter of maintaining the battery's health until B-day.As of this writing, it's approximately 2 months to go before the S24 is announced. Unless that phone introduces an unexpected game-changing must-have feature (QI2 magnetic charging is likely, but that doesn't matter much to me), this one will still serve you extremely well and should easily last until you can (finally!!) get a user-serviceable device again.","October 15, 2023"

Blocky design feels better in hand.Nothing I can post here that will be better than the tech reviewers online, just that the nearly $800 phone doesn't come with CABLES OR CHARGER. Absolutely insane that at this price point Samsung decides to cheap out.This honestly aggravates me and might bot consider another Samsung phone again. They're turning into Apple selling their products piece meal for extra charges.3 stars because Samsung is awfully cheap and don't appreciate their customers. Can't even include a basic cable.","March 28, 2024"
2400,Samsung Galaxy S23,Joe,5,"Bought this for my mother to use as she was overdue for an upgrade. I am personally an iOS user.Aesthetic--The design of this phone is very sleek and lightweight. I particularly like that its design is a little less wide with consideration to holding the phone better, especially if you have smaller hands like we do.Camera--Immaculate camera quality for the price. I think I'm jealous. There's great contrast and saturation to colors, and it gives life to the photos taken. There's so much more detail as well. Not a fan of using it for selfies for that same reason though haha!As for software, I think it was fairly simple to setup and relatively straightforward. Samsung has come a long way since the very first Galaxy S I used prior to switching, and this is one of their best designs on my opinion.","August 12, 2023"
2401,Samsung Galaxy S23,Susan Esposito,4,"One of the reasons I upgraded from my Galaxy S10 was because the battery was no longer holding a charge more than a few hours, which was expected after 2.5 years of use.However, the S23 is down to 20% battery after only 10 hours including few phone calls but a couple episodes of a series, plus browsing and texting, almost no socials.The camera is a agreat improvement although I love the S10's. This camera takes very good portraits and is 8K capable although those videos are quite heavy and demand a lot from apps like CapCut, also take a lot of space.","June 3, 2023"

A few key points are left out or hidden.  First is the fact that Samsung decided to eliminate the SD card slot to force people to buy a higher capacity phone.  I had a 128g and this is a 128g so its a step backwards.  I had 12g memory,  this has 8g.  The S23 screen is slightly smaller and a slightly smaller battery.  $700 for a slightly better camera / processor?  It's getting returned.","July 23, 2023"

I never could hear my son on his phone either so I believed it to be an apple issue not a me issue. Apple phones for some reason sound so soft to me.So I switched back to the samsung galaxy. The phone is not my favouirte. Half the time it won't read my fingerprint. The pictures are OK but not as good quality as I excepted for a new phone. Limited features. And as it won't read my fingerprint very often I don't have to touch the xxx thing and like this morning it placed an order for me. apparently I can't remove my information without doing an entire factory reset.I hate you have to go to your contacts for phone number then an app for voicemail. I was told it had voice to text but my phone always says its unavailable. I can't use this bixby thing correctly and it makes it hard I won't set up to my blue tooth in my car so its useless.

After 30 minutes,  he said he was going to transfer me to another department so I could exchange the phone.After 10 minutes, he was finally able to transfer me.  They made me repeat everything I told the technician and then told me I couldn't simply exchange the phone and I couldn't get the same credit for turning in my old phone because the deal had ended.  I told them the phone was defective, I have had the phone less than two weeks, and it has been defective since I pulled it out of the box. I just want a working phone and I shouldn't have to pay extra for it.  They said let me see what I can do.  They put me on hold and hung up on my 3 minutes later.I called back.  I got a new guy who said I would need to return the phone and buy it again and they would price match.  But, get this, YOU HAVE TO RETURN EVERYTHING IN YOUR ORDER AND REORDER IT.  And, not only do you have to return everything in the order and reorder it, you have to return them in separate boxes with separate shipping labels.  He prepared the order and sent me a link. The total was higher than what I originally paid. He said, when I return the items, they will return the original amount plus the difference between the two orders.  We'll see.  I loved my previous Samsung devices, but this may be the last one I ever purchase.  This is the most convoluted exchange for a defective item I have ever had to deal with.Original review 12/8/23: This phone has the worst GPS service of any phone I have have owned - including off-brand phones.  My Samsung S10e got a great signal in almost every building I was ever in.  If you're indoors and more than 2 inches from the window, this dumb thing is like ""GPS?  What's that? ""  I'm not using hyperbole; it's truly that bad.  Sometimes it's even slow to aquire a signal when I'm outdoors on a clear day.Data service isn't much better. If you move away from the window, web pages start loading like 3G hasn't even been invented yet.  I'm going to contact Samsung and see if I just got a defective phone.  If this is just how the S23 performs, I'm sticking with the S10e.  It's an awesome phone, my battery is just getting old so it doesn't hold a charge as well.","December 8, 2023"
2454,Samsung Galaxy S23,Dawn,1,"These companies are getting so big AND consumers are getting so stupid that a company like Samsung can now offer you a camera with less features and paint it up like it is better.These top of the line phones are now coming without and expandable external memory why? This is so they can MAKE YOU PAY MORE for extra memory.Crap business model, I will keep the phone I currently have and when Samsung loses market share wait for a phone that will have that feature again... what a complete disappointment!","December 2, 2023"
2455,Samsung Galaxy S23,K,2,"Due to my S10E filling with saltwater I had to replace it.  I bought the S23 but returned it immediately.  My main complaint is that it is too big.  I'm in the minority, I prefer small phones that fit in my pocket and my hand.  Back when the S10 generation was out they had the S10E for people like me to choose from, great phone, but no smaller option in this generation.  Oh well.  Then I tried to pull the SD card out of my S10E and put in my S23 and :brakes screech:  no SD card slot!  and this is after discovering no headphone jack either.  I frequently plug my phone into various stereos to stream music so that's a bummer.  Then it doesn't come with a charger!?  Saving E waste!?  It doesn't work if you don't charge it!  What's next, saving the environment by selling cars with no tires?  Think of the landfills!  I returned it, and discovered you can still get the S10E, which I always liked, brand new for significantly less money.","October 10, 2023"
2456,Samsung Galaxy S23,J Clayton,1,"The Samsung S23 claims to have exceptional 50MP photos but it has a builtin flaw with its processing 50 MP photos. This is a well noted flaw in numerous online platforms. Samsung processes the 50 MP photos that actually over tints the yellow, reduces the sharpness, and degrades the image. Online notifications by Samsungs fails to address this or give the Samsung community hope they will remedy this on a relatively expensive phone/camera. Interested purchasers should consider this if the higher resolution photos are important in the phone selection.","October 2, 2023"

Very sleek design with vibrant display and camera quality is out of this world (which is what I originally bought this for).

2464,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,Mr Eddie S,5,"Firstly I was pretty skeptical of purchasing an unlocked phone never owning one before but so far this device has been nothing but first class performance. The only issue I have had so far is with getting this masterpiece to do wifi calling, but I have this same problem with my Galaxy S20 Plus and was able to figure out how to get it working and I have high hopes that the same will happen here. I have tried the moon zoom and it was spectacular. I love the size of this phone though I wish Samsung had at least made it the same size as the Galaxy S22 Ultra which is 6.9 inches, but however I can still work with 6.8 inches. I love the bigger screen phones because they are better for conducting business on the go and of course videos, movies and photography. Love the brightness of the screen and need I not mention the S Pen which I always wanted. Though it's true that this phone is pretty expensive, still, all in all it's worth every single penny for everything thing that has been put into it including hours of labor and time. I didn't want to upgrade my Galaxy S20 Plus this soon, but after seeing the moon zoom and the fact that this phone featured the popular S Pen, I have no other choice but to dive in, besides life is too short to not have the things we work hard for, so with that said I pampered myself to this device that I hope to have for many years to come. I seen in the reviews where someone stated that the phone will not charge past 85 percent. Go to settings, battery and device care followed by battery and then more battery setting and turn off the protect battery setting if you want your device to charge the entire 100 percent. However keep in mind that keeping this setting turned on increase the life of your battery when it only charges to 85 percent. Sound quality has also improved once again in this device and that is something that I love as well. I guess the even better part is the updates that is going to hopefully follow to put the icing on the cake because, as far as the hardware..... it's all there. Samsung has even stepped up their game and threw in McAfee on this one, so with that said, I stepped mine's up as well and bought the package deal from McAfee that will protect up to 10 devices. People, you ain't going to get better than this. This phone is super fast. I'm going to miss the memory card slot but just like the headphones port, I'll get over it quickly for all that this phone packs, I say so long memory card slot, welcome home Galaxy S23 Ultra.Update: 5/28/23.After having this phone longer, I've discovered more about it. The Bluetooth feature in this device is much faster than the one on my S20 Plus. My Galaxy Watch now connects instantly, where in my S20 Plus it took a few seconds to connect. I have been loving this phone so much that I have decided to replace the original plastic S Pen that came with it with the aluminum one to do my own part of keeping high-end products matched up with high-end products as I did with the case, going with the Otterbox Defender series pro case for this baby. I've heard people mention having dropped calls on Samsung phones, however I have not experienced that in this device this far into ownership. The photo of the Cellular Tower I took using the camera on this phone was taken from about a mile and some change away and I was zoomed to around 30mm out of 100, just to give you a better idea of what the camera on this device can do. I am very tickle with the benchmark results of this device, very, very beautiful results. Still waiting to see what it will do with a full moon not to mention the very popular ""Super Moon"". After using this phone for nearly two months now I still must say that it has been an amazing experience. I have also noticed where some are unfairly reviewing the phone, either you have a defective device or is not doing something right. The battery should be no less than 5 stars, and I personally would give it 10 stars if I could for being a perfect 10. I have gotten at least 4 days out of my phone off a single charge, I have also noticed where the fingerprint scanner got an unfair low rating, again if you use it right it will work right. Since setting this area of the phone up I have not once had any problems with the fingerprint scanner picking up my fingerprint, even when I have done it snappy it has never failed to work. So far on this device, I have not experienced any of the dropped calls that I hear about since the very moment I inserted my sim card into this phone. At last, I was able to take a few photos of the popular supermoon. Wasn't that clear of an evening here but I still must say that the camera on this phone did an awesome job capturing it at 230mm and around 7mp.","May 12, 2023"
2465,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,BBwu,5,"This phone is huge and weighs in a good bit more than my last phone.  Battery life seems to be about the same as what I had.  Lots to be said about this phone.Camera is pretty dang nice.  There are some strange 'glitches' when it transfers between lenses.  Even though this is Android and I have been using Android, there is a ton to learn to use the camera.Screen is very clean and nice.Finger print reader  with a screen protector is kind of hit and miss.  The detectors is behind the screen.  Not sure how they work that magic but its kind of cool.  Make sure you set your pin first.Reception.  This seems to be pretty good on t mobile.  I was able to just take my sim card from my old phone and insert it into this phone... no need to go to the store to transfer the account.  Copied the data from my old phone using a usb cable in 10ish minutes.  No problems there.All the critical apps seem to be working like before.  Some needed to be re-setup.  Had to reconnect to our WIFI networks.Very disappointed that you cannot use a micro-SD card.  Especially when you see the price difference to get something like 1T of storage.  Its a bit ridiculous to have a 200 M pixel camera and not allow for user supplied storage.  In fact, its really really lame.The weight and size of the camera takes a bit to get used to.  Its only like an inch longer and 1/3 inch wider, but wow what a difference that makes.The speaker(s) are really good.  There is kind of a spatial sound on this phone.The phone is pretty fast for everything I have done, processor wise.The s-pen its really cool...i have been using it as a remote trigger for the phone.The phone surface is pretty slick (as in a little slippery) so I highly recommend a  case.Magsafe is a cool feature.  There is a magnetic attachment point over the wireless charging.  With the right case, you can do several things with this, like attach a second battery with no wires, just by placing it behind the case.  You can add a kick-stand, wallet, etc.Customization is pretty solid on the phone.  Seems like you can customize pretty much anything.Blutooth pairing is pretty simple and have had no problems here.Overall, this is a good phone.  Plan on taking a week or so to explore all the different features.","June 16, 2023"
2466,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,Mr Eddie S,5,"I'd like to first note that the transaction was amazing, received in under 24 hrs after ordering, came in perfect condition.5 star phone▪︎Amazing cameras,100x zoom,8k30fps compatible, 200mp sensor!▪︎Amazing display , 1440p 120fps(can go all the way down from 1hz to a max of 120hz, I must say the display is so beautiful especially when watching 4k UHD HDR videos!▪︎S pen, I personally haven't used it too much but it can be very useful for artists, writing signatures,  taking pictures along with many other tasks.▪︎fast chip!! It uses the snapdragon 8 gen 2 which appears to work perfectly for demanding tasks such as hard-core gaming , multi tasking or even multi windows running simultaneously,  I personally haven't experienced 0 lags or stutters. It also dramatically is better in terms of managing heat and maintaining battery life compared to the s22 ultra!▪︎security is top tier !! It's secured by Samsung Knox, has a secured folder, fingerprint reader(in screen) and facial recognition (along with all the other standard security options) the fingerprint works perfectly no issues.▪︎self diagnose,  the phone can self diagnose and test to make sure all the services are working properly.▪︎ it's a Samsung! With Samsung it offers so many features, including free on-demand and live TV with over 100 channels, it has loads of unique features and services, a few examples are Bixby which is both an assistant and a tool for automated tasks, you also get loads of automation with the device for various tasks to help make your device more convenient.The battery on this and heat management is top tier, it's actually on Apples battery type level and that says something,  there's so much to unpack and I hope to be able to explore it all eventually. This phone is definitely not for the weak, it's specifically a high-end phone meant to be used to the fullest.Only con: it has a 10mp front facing camera.  The s22 ultra camera was so good all around that I only used snapchats camera and never the actual stock camera, now that it's 10mp and not 40mp, it's noticeably different.  I think this is a major down grade regardless if it's stock camera benefits from this.There's much more to mention but that's what came to mind, over all if you're looking for a premium phone and want a high-quality device , this phone definitely gets the job done by far with no issues, I'd highly advise a phone case as this phone is not cheap.Love it!","March 16, 2023"
2467,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,Mr Eddie S,5,"I recently purchased the Galaxy S23+ and I must say, it has exceeded all my expectations. This phone is a game-changer in every sense of the word.

2468,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,VR,5,"I finally broke down and got a Samsung. For many many years my phone brand has always been LG. I have always found LG phones to be the best value for money. They pioneered features way before other brands; like tap to wake. They performed just as well as iPhone and Samsung but for much less money. But unfortunately LG left the smartphone market a couple of years ago and my LG V60 was finally showing it's age. I was finally forced to get something that wasn't LG for the first time in almost 2 decades. I was set and ready to get the one plus 11 and I had even purchased it and everything. The next day I discovered it had no water resistance rating nor wireless charging. One by itself wouldn't have been a deal breaker but lacking both features in tandem are unfortunately. Once I realized that, I cancelled my order for the One Plus. Normally I wouldn't consider Samsung, as they are just as expensive as Apple, but I did come across some really good deals on Prime day. I had considered the the 23 Ultra but was concerned about the overall size and I wouldn't use the stylus; so for me the price premium wasn't worth it. So I went for the 512GB 23+. I use my phone a lot during the day so I wanted a phone with plenty of storage and processing power. So far it's been working great; very speedy, feature rich, user friendly, and responsive. My cell reception seems to be better and it connects to all my devices well. My one gripe is the face recognition and fingerprint reader usually don't work the first time, which is annoying. I wish they would use a dedicated sensor and not an in-screen reader. Other than that the phone is a good choice and a good value considering I got a pretty good deal on it. So far, Samsung seems to be a good alternative to LG.","September 22, 2023"
2469,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,ddkwfms,4,"Don't listen to the one star haters. This phone is great. The screen is large and very bright. The UI is snappy and the battery lasts all day. I average over 9 hours of screen on time. That is impressive given the size and brightness of the screen. Takes roughly an hour to charge from 10% to 100% using an Anker 45 watt fast charger.Was able to upgrade to Android 14/One UI 6 after initial setup. Smart Switch was able to transfer all my apps, messages and photos as well. It even transfered active logins for certain apps. Which was nice.Stereo speakers are nothing special. They sound exactly like the speakers from the cheap A series phones. Not really a big deal to me as they are perfectly fine for videos. The speakers are not very good for music so I use my Galaxy buds or a Bluetooth speaker.Lastly, the fingerprint scanner that others have complained about. It takes some getting used to. It's a bit frustrating initially but once you get the muscle memory down it unlocks I'd say about 98% of the time on the first attempt. Train as many prints as possible. It definitely helps. Also, turn on increased touch sensitivity in settings.This phone is definitely worth it. The flat screen is nice and the size is perfect. It definitely has some heft. Making it feel premium. Which can't be said of the A series of phones.If you are on the fence, just get it. You won't regret it.","November 27, 2023"
2470,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,A Hans,5,"I got this as an upgrade from my S20 fe. I had my hesitations but after using it for a couple of weeks, I can say that without a doubt, this was a worthy upgrade!I got it while it was discounted and opted in for the monthly payment plan, which is going smoothly. The sound quality is far superior to that of my other phone but what I really like are how much more capable this phone is, from it's S Pen to the photo editing features, and the high capacity RAM, which allows me to use several apps at once without having them close on me after much inactivity or lag on me.It also has so many more features that can be tweaked in the settings and I love how you can change the sizing format of the homescreen to fit more apps there. There's so much that can be done and used that I guarantee you'll need to watch a couple of YouTube videos to see the full breadth of what this thing can do.And the camera is better than any phone camera I've used. The zoom is sick. You can tweak the settings in it to get the capture quality you like. The battery life is also far better and out performs the S20 fe. You can use the battery saver features to stretch its life after each charge.If there's a downside, I'd say that finding a screen protector that will work with it and allow you to use the fingerprint unlock function at the same time, will be tricky. It took me 4 purchases to find a decent screen protector that doesn't feel like thick plastic and doesn't pop right off because of the curved screen. Even once I found a functional one that felt good, it occasionally gives me issues with fingerprint unlock.In short, the pros far outweigh any cons. This phone for me is the best on the market as of this date. It doesn't have me missing my S20 fe one bit!","October 13, 2023"
2471,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,A Hans,5,"I work in I.T. support and see too many issues with Apple products. I have had Samsung phones since around 2014. I have an S5, an S7 and S9. The S5 & S7 are retired now but still work. The S9 is still active on another line. All these have had ""normal"" lives, dropped now and then, survived spills and weather. It only made sense to move to the S23 series and I got this Ultra model mainly for the large screen to help with my old shaky hands. I used the Smart Switch app to move files from the S9 to this phone and it saved a ton of time. There are many manual things that need to be done to complete the switch but this worked well. This phone is awesome. The cameras are better than most of my stand alone digital cameras. The phone itself has great clarity and the cell and WiFi connections are very stable. 5G speeds are awesome but I normally don't play games or watch much video with this phone. All but a couple apps still work that transferred from the S9. A feature that I miss is the standard audio jack for headphones. Battery life on this phone is better than the S9, the wireless charging stations I already have work great and the display size is a major improvement for me and my clumsy hands. I highly recommend this phone.","December 21, 2023"
2472,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,Ryan,5,"I bought a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra U. S. Version unlocked and brand new at the significantly reduced price of $969 when it originally sold for $1200.00.  The current top of the line Samsung phone is the S24 Ultra, but there are minimal differences between the S23 Ultra and the S24 Ultra and the $969 that I paid is $330 less than the $1299 price of a new S24 Ultra.  Even with some S24 Ultras selling on sale for $1149, I still saved $180.  Here are some of the minimal differences between the S23 Ultra and the S24 Ultra.  1-The S24 Ultra has AI capability, but it will be coming in software updates to the S23 Ultra and Samsung plans to start charging for it in the future anyway so It's no big deal.  2-For the S24 Ultra, Samsung dispensed with the curved edges of the display found on the S23 Ultra, leaving a flat front (Samsung claims it has 47% less bezel on the sides). That new screen is also brighter with a maximum of 2,600 nits (the S23 Ultra maxed out at 1,750 nits) and thus easier to see in bright daylight. The S24 Ultra's screen is also made of Corning's newest and toughest material, Gorilla Glass Armor, while the S23 has Corning's Gorilla Glass Victus 2.  3-As for cameras, the S24 Ultra inherits most of its predecessor's lenses and sensors but does use a 50-megapixel 5x optical telephoto camera in place of the 10-megapixel 10x optical camera in the S23 Ultra. While the new camera has a shorter optical length, its higher megapixel count should mean photos taken with it are sharper than those shot with the S23's 10x optical camera.  To get to 10x optical length, the S24 Ultra shoots with its 5x optical camera and crop zooms in.  4-The S24 Ultra is powered by a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, which is faster than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 in the S23 Ultra. Configurations have also been simplified in the new premium phone: you can only get 12GB of RAM and 256GB, 512GB or 1TB of storage (no 8GB RAM option, as there was in the S23 Ultra). The rest of the hardware remains relatively unchanged, although the S24 Ultra should get a minor battery efficiency boost thanks to its newer chipset.  5-Samsung expanded how long it's pledging to support its newest phones. The S24 Ultra comes with Android 14 and will get seven years of Android software and security patches, up from four years in the S23 Ultra (which comes with Android 13). For sustainability, the S24 Ultra has more recycled parts, including cobalt in its battery and rare earth elements in its speakers.  I took all of these minor differences into account and I felt that they weren't worth the $330 difference.  I will look for similar deals on new models that were just replaced with newer models in the future.  I would also advise anyone buying any new cellphone to buy an unlocked U. S. model so you aren't tied to any one cellphone carrier while you are paying off the phone.","April 14, 2024"
2473,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,KW,5,"Had the phone for a couple days. Everything works as it should so far. Like new condition. I was able to add to my spectrum plan with ease. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was how the phone was put back into the box. Instead of being put back into the cardboard sleeve in the box, it was all just kinda shoved in the little phone box, squished, and taped shut. The screen and lenses were fine regardless.  The battery is lasting a long time.","August 1, 2024"

2475,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,BBwu,3,"Update: (3 stars still). Replacement arrived, screens felt slightly different. Placed carefully in pocket every time, and checked the phone after each withdrawal. For the first few times all seemed well; however, a few micro and I mean micro scratches appeared. You can't see them in standard light but if you look at it like a crazy person like I did (after the first phone's issues) you can see them. There is no way this phone would last a long time on it's own. Either samsung has some really bad quality control or I have to say the new glass is definitely a flop. I gave a family member my old s21 ultra already but I kind of wishing I had it as I really dislike the screen protector feel, but I don't think you can safely own this phone without one (or get lucky with quality control).The phone's battery has been fantastic though, much more efficient power wise. The photos are naturally very good as well (not that s21's were bad though). The phone is slim, the pen is nice (I used a phone case with a pen attached to it for my old 21 so I was excited to get it internal). The phone seems to process things quite quickly and things look as good and as smooth as you'd expect for the price (good).The material that seemed to cause the scratch was a synthetic like material that lined the pocket on some icebreaker shorts (merino wool company). Both my s21 ultras have been stored in this pocket before (which I've owned for multiple years). The previous phone I'm not sure which material caused it but it had many scratches that were visible from different angles. I don't wear blue jeans which have those metal buttons, I only wear slacks, cotton, and merino. I don't work in a sand pit either, so whatever scratched these phones was simply in the pocket out of the pocket (was never dropped). I even have my Note 10s, zero scratches.There is definitely something disappointing with their new glass. I've read some people say its because it's more shatter resistant so it's softer.. so I suppose if you're a phone dropper that might be good news, but I've never dropped my phone.. I'd rather be able to enjoy the premium screen feel with a scratch free screen.One note is the s21 ultra screens feel MUCH harder / smoother than the s23 ultra, which has a sort of soft squish and very very slight resistance.Amazon's customer service has been great and I would recommend buying phones from them- whichever phone you choose.If you were fine with your battery and camera, didn't need an upgrade, and had a sturdy phone then I'm not sure I'd suggest buying this as it's very expensive yet fairly fragile phone as it defeat's it's own luxury feel by requiring a screen protector (or luck of QC).If you're a screen protector free type person, then I don't recommend the phone, unless you're also into some gambling in which case buy the phone from Amazon so you can at least potentially replace it without a nightmare.Working with samsung on this is just an exercise in pain, though if they turn around somehow I'll update the review again.Previous Update: 3 stars- After talking to support for a third time they suggested to have Amazon replace it so I'm not out of a phone (and it's under the 15 day warranty). Amazon customer service was very quick and easy. Will update again for better or worse. Old review below.Old review 1 Star:Phone screen scratches easily, like put in and take our of your pocket. I've had a s21 ultra for multiple years and the screen looks brand new- not a single scratch at /any/ angle of light, there is no screen protector. The s23 ultra after a few /days/ has multiple micro abrasions that you can see at certain angles (like tiny scratches). I'm not one to put the phone in the same pocket as keys or just toss it in the bag either. Potentially a manufacturing defect, but Samsung support has been bad. Couldn't make a service request through their members system so I contacted chat who made it for me, arrived at the center they told me to go, they said they can't do anything for me because they don't have the screen and even if they did they wouldn't help because it's common scratching (... No way that is true, unless the glass is worse than s21..??).It's certainly a fast phone and the pen is neat, the functionality of the phone is great, I assume it's a good batch bad batch thing. Otherwise If the screen is actually weaker then the older phone then.. don't upgrade. If you're lucky it's probably great. :/","February 28, 2023"
2476,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,Dave,5,"I will dislose upfront that I am likely an android fanboy, whose never had an iphone. However, I did seriously consider switching right before getting this S23 Ultra. Heres why I ultimattely  went with Samsung this time.I have stuck with android, and used many over the years. Droid Razr, Nexus6P, Pixel2, Xperia I 3.  I am familiar with  and like the useability of android. Just how it is. MAIN USE: It was important to me I get a phone that can meet my goals of retaining media. I was able to move all my music files and photos collections rather easily to the S23. About 2400 songs, and favorite pics and videos from all my phones. It would have likely been a nightmare if I switched to iphone. Something about needing itunes or whatever, on a PC. No thanks. And i use a 3rd party music app and bam, phone is my main music collection.In my research, and knowing full well, Samsung is the android leader that Pixel wants to be. I have no illwill toward them, just acknowledging Google desperately trying to catch  up. Samsung has the specs, the hardware, and top camera above all. They have the brand too stand behind as well.CAMERA: I love how great the camera works. It really shines when outdoors is good lighting. Videos come out crystal clear.  I know some of my iphone friends may have taken a doubletake at the quality when seeing for themseelves. Has slowmo, superslow mo, wide angle, zoom, you name it. SHots still come out great even zoomed. Not blurry like my previous phones with a zoom lens.BATTERY: S23 is fast charging when using the right cable and plugin charger, otherwise slow trickles if using a ""slow"" one. Battery seems to last me 2 days, but I do not use my phone 24/7 on super brightness. It would last longer if I didnt use it at all during work, but I tend to play music so of course.SCREEN: Its a nice big display alright. Not 100% sure, but i think bigger than newest big ihpone?  Nice and bright and clear. Phone is fast, and works well.THE BAD: Here re my legit criticisms of this phone. NO headphone jack. I know its old tech, but having nice wired phones be relegated to pc use is meh. No SD card slot.  As media focused as I am, I hate that sd card slots have been phased out. BRING THE SD CARD SLOT BACK.OVERALL: This S23 Is a great phone. Despite the industry ditching sd cards and headphone jacks. IMO, likely the best android  brand today. Pixel would likely be the close 2nd place. This S23 is frequently on sale due to the next Galaxies coming out, and is ultimately still cheaper than comparable iphone equivalents. If you want top of the line, its this.","November 12, 2023"
2477,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,BBwu,3,"I've had this phone a day so I obviously haven't had it long enough to give a full, educated review of it. I'm writing this review because I will most likely be returning it.First off, I'm coming from an iPhone SE and you could easily hide that phone inside this one. I knew it was big, but this might be too big.Coming from iPhone where everything is intuitive, I am struggling to do even basic stuff on this phone like see the weather without having to just look it up in a browser. A lot of this stuff is to be expected and I don't knock off points for not knowing the UI. It just feels like it could be a little easier for new Android users to figure things out. The absence of a home button will take a lot of getting used to.The fingerprint scanner works great. So great that I had my wife try to open my phone using her print, which it didn't work. It's just sometimes I can barely touch the scanner and it will open. I think this is great. I haven't set up face recognition as it's a feature I just can't see messing with.I thought that it being an Android phone, using Google apps would be seamless. But I'm having to log into each Gmail account and re-log any time I log out, even though on the computer, I'm logged into all of my Google accounts and can switch between them easily. Same with YouTube. So far, this phone is acting like it's day one every time I want to switch to another account.Battery life has been good so far. It had 50% when it arrived and it's down to 42% after almost 24 hours. But battery life on all new phones is miraculous, though. A year from now, it will struggle to make it 4 hours of heavy use without needed topped up. But topping up isn't something Samsung thought about as you don't even get a charger included. I won't be able to charge this phone until my I order or go buy a charger. I didn't see this when I bought it, so I'm to blame for that ignorance, but when I read it was to cut down on e-waste, I knew that was a load of bull. It's the same reason my wife's Kia didn't come with a spare tire: everything is a-la-cart these days. My old device, packaging, charger and phone case are now waste, but you're concerned about ONLY the charger? I can't reuse my charger. Because Apple has to be a special snowflake and use lightning. Which they are doing away with I believe, so I would have had to buy a new charger even with Apple because everyone is moving to this new format of giving you most of the things you need, but not everything.The phone is good I guess. It looks amazing. You set the resolution between 720, 1080, or 1440 to save on battery. It's snappy and fast. Calls are clear but I was on Wi-Fi at the time so who knows what it sounds like out in the wild. Plenty of customization options ofc. I like that it has a reboot option instead of power off only like the SE had. The problem is, unless I'm doing it wrong, the button combo to power it down, is the same as taking a screenshot. I've taken quite a few needless screenshots while trying to master the timing to get to the power down/reboot option to pop up. Supposedly you can take screenshots by waving your palm across the face, but even after enabling this feature (which is off by default and in your s-pen settings), I haven't been able to make it work even once.I'd say this phone is powerful enough for desktop gaming and probably has a lot of content available for it, but this charger thing that everyone is moving to needs to be pushed back against.Having customers buy a charger from a 3rd party doesn't cut down on waste, it just fattens their profit margin.","September 27, 2023"
2478,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,CrossboneV,4,"Okay okay so you know what you're buying this phone for: the camera.  Or perhaps lots of other reasons too, but hot dang, the camera though.  I'd say as a professional DSLR photographer that this is as close as it gets to having pro capabilities on a phone, but that it's still not quite there yet.  On a DSLR you've got quite a big dynamic range of light and dark and color and everything in between that gets snapped with a photo, whereas on this phone it's probably cut in half... but it's still the best dang thing we've got in the form of a phone.  I find myself actually snapping more phone pics than Nikon DSLR pics these days honestly, since I bought this thing.Otherwise?  Processing power is bar-none speedy as.  Far better than the iPhones I've been toting everywhere for years.  Interface is easy to figure out, even if you're indoctrinated to the Apple world.  Storage space is big (on the 512GB), and I back up on MS OneDrive, so it's no biggie anyway.  Lots of apps to choose from since Android is kinda like how Windows is to OSX in terms of what's available to you.  Screen is a monster which is awesome for visibility and workability, but is still just fine in a standard pocket and doesn't feel cumbersome.  Wi-fi adapter is snappy.  S-Pen is super cool!  Audio is bomber.I suppose my only complaints are:(1) that the 'adaptive brightness' mode is obnoxious in that it does work well to alter screen brightness per lighting situation but it sucks that the brightest the phone can get is only available in that particular mode... so if you're in changing lighting situations and you're annoyed that it won't just be bright all the time, deal with it.  This is the pits with certain photography situations when under shadowfall.(2) The phone wants to automatically send text messages via RCS or whatever which is wi-fi only and so sometimes if you or the recipient is not on wi-fi at the moment the text fails to send.  Sometimes you have no idea when this has happened until later when you see a note that 'message has failed to send.' Ugh.  You can however set options in text threads to 'SMS only' which is via 4G only.(3) This isn't really an issue with the product so much as an issue with current tech, but a sort of 'buyer beware' notice: the aperture on these phone cameras is so shallow that it compares like a candle to the sun in terms of all around image focus per phone to DSLR quality.  I will say I am tremendously impressed with how far phone cameras have come, but that it is still wounding that phones can't overcome this obstacle.Anyway, buy this thing.  You will NOT regret buying this thing.  That is all.","August 20, 2023"
2479,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,Derrick H,4,"I bought this when the battery started going on my old phone.  Overall, I'm pretty happy with it, but I have noticed an issue now and then where if I even hover over the screen, it acts like I pressed down.  Very annoying when playing games.","July 10, 2024"

2482,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,Shaina Palakkattu,4,"I'm totally blind! I got this to replace my old S21 cell phone. For the most part, I like Samsung Galaxy devices do to the louder external speaker over other devices like iPhones.But anyway when I got this phone; The button layout are in the same arangement as my old phone. For me, that was a plus. The external speaker running the Same TTS along with Talkback doesn't seem to be as clear to me. It sounds like it is a little muffeled and a little lower in volume even with the same settings as my S21 like when in a pocket.When charging the phone; The charging spead doesn't look to be much improved. You would think going from an 25W (S21) to and 45W (S23 plus) you would see a large difference on charging time. But looks to be only about 15 minutes or so difference. Yes a totally blind person needs to have the phone on to know how the phone is doing as far as charging otherwise the screen reader will not work. I do like the faster charging being I don't have to wait as long even that it is only 15 or so minutes faster. But again, this is an larger battery. Speaking of the battery! I get about 2 days and more on a charge. The old phone I was getting about 1.5 days. I mainly use my phone to make and  receive calls. I keep the screen off being a totally blind person doesn't need that function on to suck power. But running the external speaker takes as much power to run as the screen does! lol.As far as turning on the phone to me seams to take as long as the old S21 to startup. This phone does work on AT&T network even on 5G. The bad thing is you cannot lock it to 5G only! But I'm guessing that this is do to Samsung and AT&T having an agreement that the phone must be set to Auto and the user cannot control that. Same goes if you are having trouble with cell signal quality and you want to use Wi-Fi calling! As long as you have an cell signal coverage! Wi-Fi calling will not work. Again AT&T not wanting  people to use that as long as you are on there network. Other devices like Apples; Allow you to do that being they told AT&T you aren't going to do that.","August 18, 2023"

2484,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,Mr Eddie S,4,"Vengo de un celular OnePlus 5T (de adelante sera referido como OP5T)  que lo adquiri en el 2015. Hay varias cosas que no me han terminado de agradar a la hora de cambiarme de telefono.Cosas que me gustaron:1. LA CAMARA. Totalmente increible. Soy mucho de tomarle fotos a las estrellas, luna, paisajes e insectos. Realmente valio la pena comprarlo por esto.2. Al jugar juegos que incluso son muy exigentes, no se calienta para nada3. La pantalla. No se como describirlo, pero tiene mucha nitidez, aunque no es muy brillosa. Ademas, como pro y contra, es demasiado demasiado lisa, es comodo usarlo, pero resbala, lo cual en ciertos juegos puede perjudicarCosas que me disgustaron:1. La huella dactilar esta en la pantalla frontal, mientras que en el OP5T esta en la parte de atras, con una cavidad. A la hora de usar la huella, cuesta encontrar correctamente donde poner el dedo, teniendo que realizar varios intentos antes de acertarle, mientras que en el OP5T al tener la cavidad, facilmente podias sentir que estabas colocando bien el dedo.2. El reconocimiento facial demora bastante a comparacion del OP5T y lo peor es que al dia de hoy, una vez reconocido no hay modo de quitar la pantalla de bloqueado, entonces debes esperar a que te reconozca y hacer swipe para desbloquear si usas este metodo3. El celular pesa muchisimo, un poco menos del doble que el OP5T, hasta cierto punto es cansado sostenerlo.4. No trae cargador, solamente cable USB C a USB C y esto fue un dolor de cabeza para mi porque tuve que incurrir a un gasto extra ya que no tengo ningun cargador de USB C5. El sonido es relativamente bajo6. Por el precio, hubiera sido bueno agregarle un protector y/o un case7. Para tomar screenshots es un poco complicado. Mientras que en el OP5T tenia el boton de apagado en un lado y el de volumen en el otro lado, estos estan del mismo lado, lo cual se me hace un poco incomodo de presionar para tomar screenshot. Y si es usando gesto, debes pasar todo la palma, lo cual tampoco se me hace practico. En OP5T puedes deslizar tres dedos de arriba hacia abajo para tomar screenshot.","September 1, 2023"
2485,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,BBwu,5,"This was an amazing purchase for me. But I do have to preface this review by saying that I am updating from  an LG G4 that I got for free from Verizon in 2016, so this is a complete upgrade for me from a practically useless phone versus people moving from a more recent model.This phone is HUGE. I am somewhat regretting not paying closer attention to the dimensions and opting for one of the lesser s23 models, but I know I’ll get used to it after a month or so. New phones are always an adjustment.I was able to set up my phone through Verizon but was unable to do it with the eSIM and had to head to a store to get a physical sim. So be aware if you plan on taking advantage of the eSIM. It might not be as easy as they make it seem.I do NOT use facial recognition or fingerprint scan so I can’t speak to those.The display is beautiful and covers the entire surface of the phone vs. others that have black bands on top and bottom.I’m not a huge app user so I have minimal screen time but the last time I charged my phone was 72 hours ago and I am still at 54% so the battery life is wildly impressive to me so far.Was kind of annoyed that the phone only comes with a cord and no wall outlet, especially since both ends of the cord is USBC so your old usb to wall adapter may not be enough. I expected this though and ordered a Samsung OEM charger. It cost me 40$ but after buying a thousand dollar phone that seemed like spare change so I happily shelled out the money.Beware of screen protectors!! I spent 60$ on three different kinds of screen protectors before I found one that fit and actually stayed attached. The curved glass screen makes this a difficult fit but I’d rather not use it without one. Make sure you are careful about what you buy and really read reviews, especially the bad ones. Don’t be fooled by brands that offer incentive for good reviews to hide the negative ones.The amount of cameras seems a bit excessive but I look forward to trying them. The zoom, I can tell, is already incredible and I can’t wait for a clear night to get some good shots.Overall I’m VERY happy with this switch.I did buy the phone during a promotion and got higher memory at a lower price with an additional 100$ off so I did pay 300 less than manufacturer’s price.","February 23, 2023"
2486,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,Frank Sam Hu,5,"When I made this purchase I was in limbo on whether or not it was worth the cost. When I finally decided to make the purchase I wanted to get the ultra, however my friend reminded me that I'm not a lucky person when it comes to phone,  as I'm always losing my phones or dropping them and damaging the screens. So I purchase the S23 instead. Can't say I regretted it. I have been using this phone since September and I have no issue with it. Battery last me up to two days ,when I'm not actively using the Bluetooth functions. Picture quality is awesome. The size fits right inside my purses and the features are great. If you're looking for something that has 99% of the features of the ultra at an economical price then this is the phone for you. And if you're like me that love gadgets but won't use more than 60% of the features on them then this is definitely the phone for you. And if you're someone that will utilize all the features on your phone this is still the phone for you.  If you're a content creator and looking for a good phone to use, you can't go wrong with this one. Compare with a 14pro I would choose the S23 over and over.","March 11, 2024"
2487,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,Audrey B,2,"This was unfortunately a regrettable purchase, but I was thankful that I bought it through Amazon because the return process was smooth, as has been my experience with most unsatisfactory products purchased through Amazon.First and foremost, I'm an iOS user of 10 or so years, but have experimented with usage of Android on multiple occasions (once with a Note 9, another time with a Note 20 Ultra, and just recently with the S23 Ultra). I have no issue with admitting that Android triumphs in certain areas where iOS is very lackluster, but also feel the same way in reverse in thinking that iOS wins over Android in many areas as well. I suppose if I had been an Android user all along, these issues would be minute because I would be accustomed to them. So, I will give a few reasons why I have come to the conclusion that the S23U was not for me and why I switched back to iOS (and went with an iPhone 14 Pro Max):- My biggest gripe was the battery life. I chock up many of the positive reviews (both here on Amazon and on other websites containing reviews that I used to influence me to buy the S23U in the first place) to not knowing any better, and potentially being lifelong Android users. Within a couple of minutes of removing the S23U from the charger, battery life began dropping. This is after extensive viewing of YouTube (or Google) tutorials for advice on what settings would best be used to preserve the battery life and make it last longer. Every potential setting that could be altered to make battery life more satisfactory on this phone was applied, but to no avail. I am your average social media doom-scroller and will snap a photo here and there, but never had any intention of heavily using this phone for, say, classroom note taking or anything similar. So, when I took the phone to work for a 4-hour shift and it was down to half its battery life by the time I left, even though I'd hardly touched it other than maybe throwing on a music playlist, it was a pretty big blow. Throughout the time I had this phone I was mortified at the thought of getting into an accident with this thing on hand in the event that the battery died on me, but just didn't really feel like I should I have to prioritize the idea of carrying a spare phone charger around with me at all times. With an iPhone and its already built in settings, I could take it off of the charger, doom-scroll for an hour and would *maybe* lose 1-2% battery life in that time.- Secondly, I had a heck of a time with notifications and particularly, text messages on the S23U. There were multiple instances where I would miss text messages because the phone never once notified me that someone had texted me. Again, I took to Google and found out that an additional app (Glimpse Notifications) can be downloaded to remedy this issue, and it luckily did, or that I am aware of. No one should have to download an app (also using up unnecessary space on their phone) in order to ensure they receive something as simple as text messages and see them on their lock screen.- Your average joe-schmo photos came out incredibly beautiful....that is, so long as using the zoom function was not imperative to whatever you were photographing. Even 3x zoom proved a massive disappointment as whatever you were taking a photo of was incredibly grainy and blurry. I have a friend who is a lifelong Android user (who also told me I would never want to go back to iPhone and would be incredibly satisfied with the S23U) whom I sent sample screenshots to, and he was shocked at how disappointing the photos were. Like I said, if you're just taking the average photo of something close up to you, it's a very pleasing sight, but if you're trying to take picture of an animal around 12 or so feet away and need a little bit of zooming...prepare for disappointment.Facial recognition was testy, to say the least. It didn't recognize my face half the time (even though I reset it, then set it back up again anew), so I just got fed up and decided to do away with it and go with the fingerprint scanner.All in all, I spent the majority of my time owning this phone navigating the settings menus or downloading apps to try and get basic functions to operate correctly. There was little enjoyment from it. For the money that I spent, it just wasn't worth it to me, personally.","May 4, 2023"

2489,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,Kay,5,"I'm an apple user 100%, an as Apple user I rate this s23: 5*. For its price and quality. Its my 2nd android phone, last being Samsung note 3, and this phone is really good in all aspects. I haven't dealt any issue with it like running apps or any crashes. Everything runs smoothly and camera quality is excellent, even better than Apple phones.It was really a nice change from the apple series and getting this android was a test to compare my apple phone. They are different but android provides more features than iphone does in my opinion. However the only thing the face recognition is not that great on the samsung, compared to phones that's quick. However I do like the fingerprint, and miss that feature on iphones.For apple users, I say this is a pretty good phone. But like me who has apple watch, ipad pro, laptop, air pods, etc~ I say if you have all those, stick with apple phones since their compatible with one another. But if you don't have all those and you want to change up, go for s23.Lastly, go for s23 then s24, if you're unsure as an apple user, s23 is still good and cheaper. There isn't much difference between them other than design and their Ai features, that s23 ( and other phone that are compatible too for the update) will get later on.Ps I'm only saying this to Apple users who want to change from apple to android^","February 18, 2024"
2490,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,Winston,4,"I got this phone on sale, $200 off, 256gb version. Samsung doesnt offer a 128gb version on the ultra, which is bogus in my opinion. Amazon prime offered same day shipping, which was nice. Phone arrived intact and fine. No problems with shipping.The build quality of the S23 Ultra is very solid and feels good in the hands. The matte finish on the back is very nice and smooth, leaves no fingerprints. The screen feels really good and smooth. The s pen is nice to have, but I find that I dont use it that much. Its nice when taking photos you can set up the phone and press the s pen button to take the photo when youre ready. Speaking of the camera, the photos are excellent quality. This phone is equipped with a 200mp camera, which takes some very detailed and clear photos. I would say this phone has the best camera compared to every other phone. This phone is equipped with a 5000 mah battery, which lasts the whole day. The fingerprint sensor works 98% of the time, when my hand is very dry it doesnt work as well. I havent tested facial recognition yet so I cant speak on that. The screen is 120 hz, and looks and feels very smooth.The android skin this phone uses, OneUI, is one of the better android skins on the market. The customization of this phone is way better than IOS in my opinion, you can do so much more. One thing I dislike about the os is that after every time i swipe up to exit an app, the samsung quick access wallet app pops up in place of the spot where I use to swipe to exit apps. I find this very annoying and I'm not sure where to disable it. One other thing I dislike is this phone requires you to have two different accounts with Google and Samsung, whereas with iPhone, all you need is an icloud account.Screen protectors are hard to put on this phone because of the curved edges, so be mindful of that.Overall, this is a VERY solid flagship device, if youre in the market for a new cell phone, this is the phone to buy.","August 9, 2023"
2491,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,Lili,5,"And get a flagship phone.  My job provided S-series phones to me for the past 10 years.  They were always a couple of generations behind but they worked fine.  I just retired in June and decided to get a cheaper Android phone to replace my company S10 which had been working perfectly.  I purchased a Motorola Stylus 5G and it's been a nightmare.  I live in a dead zone for cell signal so I need wifi calling and the Motorola kept dropping network connection.  Even though it was using wifi for all my apps just fine I often wasn't getting calls or texts.  And when I would go back to a good cell signal it wouldn't automatically connect again unless I restarted the phone.  I found myself doing restarts one or two times a day to get network and if I didn't I would miss calls or texts from people who said they couldn't get a hold of me.  I remembered this happening once before when my job gave me a mid grade A50 and it was so bad I had to return it and ask for another S series.  So lesson for me is just get a flagship...even if it's an older generation it's still going to work and age better than a mid grade.  That said, I really like the S23+.  I doesn't lose network,  works flawlessly, is a perfect size and is easy to set up.  Hopefully it ages as well as my S10 did.  I could probably still be using that if I had it.  I do miss having SD card options but there is enough memory to house my entire music collection without making a huge dent in the memory and higher end phones are discontinuing SD cards for a reason.  I got this phone 20% of retail so if you wait you can save some money.  I wish I never spent on the motorola in the first place.  Budget phones might be fine if you live in a good area with great reception, but for me the two I've tried were nothing but a waste and a pain.  This 23+ however, is a great phone.","August 16, 2023"

There is often this superstition that android phones have bad camera quality, but for my daily use this is perfect. Sometimes the camera has a hard time focusing on objects up close, and may have a slight shutter lag when taking pictures, but these are concerns which only matter to photographers.

I had a hard time with the fingerprint sensor (may have been because of my screen protector), but I found ways to overcome the difficulty. The first thing I did was re-register my fingerprint when the screen protector was on, and record several instances of my finger. The sensor, despite being ultrasonic, may take a while to recognize the fingerprint. It may also get some time before you get used to the sensor, as it may take a while the first couple of weeks.Lastly, the display is AMAZING. Having upgraded from a 2 year device, I thought the display would only be a slight improvement. But no, it comes with 60-120hz display and I have seen almost zero lag when watching videos or playing games. (Btw this phone plays high performance games like genshin impact like a boss).This is easily a phone which I would give a 10/10. After getting used to this device, the drawbacks don't really matter or become relevant.","December 6, 2023"
2494,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,Mr Eddie S,5,"One of the reasons I purchased this was for the 200mp camera. Although zooming in ultra close on a picture still has some jpeg compression artifacts, the overall image quality is great. It also has a raw mode which allows storage of picture files without compression.The other visual features are also impressive, video mode allows you to shoot in a variety of resolutions and frame rates, including up to 8k.Sound quality is impressive for a panel phone, and when watching videos with stereo audio information, the sound is actually reproduced by two speakers, one at the bottom, and the earpiece speaker, which adds more engagement when watching music or other videos.The phone sound quality is great, and is significantly better than most of the other phones I have used in the past.I have had a few minor issues with the face recognition, although if I add more variations (with sunglasses, or hats, etc.) I will probably have fewer issues. The display embedded fingerprint scanner is taking a little getting used to, but maybe re-registering the finger prints may help reduce those issues. The fact that fi get print scanning is possible on the display screen (as opposed to a dedicated scanner on the ba k or side of the phone) is another interesting feature, and is raki g me a little bit to get used to.I have only had older, reconditioned or renewed phones in the past, and have always been at least two to three years  behind the latest technology when purchasing a new phone. My last phone was at least 5 to 6 years since it was released. This is my first brand new, flagship phone, and although a bit pricey (for being an early adopter) I am pleased with the overall performance and features of the device. I am still learning about it, and finding new, neat little features that are not always a big selling point, but add to the 'wow' factor.I am very pleased with this device, and have protected it with an OtterBox defender case and a gel type screen protector, and in the month I have had it, I have enjoyed every aspect of it.","April 9, 2023"
2495,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,BBwu,5,"Best value for money. For normal browsing and video playback, I get almost 2 days of battery life. I have turned off all animations, 120Hz refresh and kept brightness to 25%. The dual speakers are loud enough at 80% volume; although some of OnePlus phones have louder speakers than this. No other phone can beat the camera. All the reviews about the phone in youtube and tech websites are 100% true. If you buy this phone, you are not going to use at least 20% of features that the phone provides in day-to-day life, that is how much the phone is capable to do. One of the best purchases I made in phones. I would definitely recommend this phone to others","April 19, 2024"

2497,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,AV,4,"The only reason I decided to replace my S8 was that the battery couldn't make it through a day even after having been replaced. I picked this phone because it has a small form factor similar to the S8 and can do induction charging unlike the A series. I did a direct comparison of battery usage between my S8 and the s23, and after being used equally for many hours, the S8 was down to 23% and the S23 was at 63%. One nice feature of this phone is that you can set an upper limit for charging, which supposedly protects the battery. Mine is currently set to stop charging at 85%.My biggest complaint about switching to this phone is the limitations for transferring apps. First of all, the transfer process takes a very, very long time, and none of the login information or passwords transfers, so you have to log into each app and, in some cases, go through a few additional steps. In this regard, I have to admit that Apple is the best company out there: you can transfer from one phone to another and immediately have the new phone do everything the old phone did without any glitches.I would also say that the phone is too expensive. It would be a bargain at half the price. Again, the only reason I bought it was that my S8 couldn't make it through the day anymore. Otherwise, I don't think the features of this phone are in any way superior.","September 16, 2023"

2500,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,Marcus,4,"This is a beautiful phone. My best one ever. Color, screen resolution, more features than ever. Hope I get another six to seven years of enjoyment as I did with my S9+. There are two discrepancies that I noticed right away: The phone unlike the past comes with no charger. Can't believe they would not provide one for the price we're paying. Secondly the very first direction is to remove the sim card. I could not get the tray to open so a hasty call to my provider saved the day when they provided a digital SIM. I love this phone and do not want to go through a terrible Christmas return. A You Tube video shows a couple tricks to get it open so I will leave it alone and enjoy my new phone. Might I suggest that Samsung check this feature when packing these phones. With all said this is a beautiful and exciting new phone and I'm looking forward to years of enjoying it.","December 7, 2023"
2501,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,Enrique McClean,3,"Lots of bloatware on these phones and the updates are way too frequent. I haven't even had it a full year and the battery is already needing to be charged almost every night. Yes, I use it a lot during the day for emails, messages, etc. but still...Camera is ok, not as terrific as the reviews made it seem. I bought this because my old S21 that we'd bought through our service provider was losing its charge too quickly, and the camera on the S23+ got really good reviews. The camera is pretty good, but for me... While cell phone cameras have come a long way and they are very handy to have, I still don't think anything beats a good Canon or Nikon digital.At least this one didn't cost as much I paid Spectrum for the S21 I bought through them. NO MORE buying phones from a carrier anymore. That phone STILL starts up as though it's still a Spectrum phone, even though it will work with the MINT Mobile sim card I used in it after we switched plans.","June 11, 2024"

2503,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,Linda,3,"I upgraded from a Galaxy S8. I held off for as long as I could. There are great things about this phone. I could grade this phone on a curve and give it 4 or 5 stars. But in truth, not having a headphone jack is inexcusable -- we all seemingly just accept it because most every other high-end phone (all?) with the promise of software updates for at least a few years is doing the same. Because of the lack of headphone jack, I had to fiddle with several USB-C to 3.5mm dongles. The first resulted in audio cutting in after every half-second of silence. Unusable. I then purchased an Anker one that did the job. I should not have spent time on this -- the phone should be making my life simpler, not harder. Bluetooth headphones are fine, but they need to be charged from time to time, and the minimum volume I can get on my BT headphones still seem far too loud -- do better if you are making us use this standard! Now, when I use my USB-C to Audio dongle, it seems my phone is draining much faster than my previous phone, and the phone does not charge as quickly.What I don't like about this phone:(1) No headphone jack resulting in a bunch of BS, like having to search for a dongle that works, the phone not charging as quickly while listening to music, depleting battery more quickly.(2) The placement of the volume rocker buttons and the power button is a more awkward design than the S8, making screenshots more difficult to take.(3) The fingerprint sensor is okay -- but I miss the placement on the S8, where you got a better intuition (especially with a case) for where to put your finger. I'm aware the S8's fingerprint reader was heavily criticized at the time, but it was great placement.(4) No more SD card slot. Which is why I had to go for the 256gb model. Great.(5) I should be allowed to uninstall apps I don't want that come with the phone. This goes for both Google and Samsung apps.What I like:(1) Battery is vastly better than the S8. I love the battery maintenance mode that limits the charge to 85%.(2) Extremely fast browsing and installing/updating apps.(3) Good camera from what I can tell.(4) Good promise of software and security updates, and Samsung now has a good track record on this.(5) Great build quality as far as I can tell.(6) Transfer from S8 to S23 was relatively straightforward using Samsung SmartSwitch. But you will have to do WhatsApp manually. iPhones do not have this issue.","September 10, 2023"
2504,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,Mr Eddie S,4,"Reading the reviews, most of the low ratings mentioned facial recognition and fingerprint reader as not being all that great.  What's new?  Out of the past smartphones I h ave owned which were mostly Samsung, this one is no worse and not all that much better.  I have never had a lot of success with either of the features having to do with security.  I have redone my face about 20 times and it's hit and miss.  As to fingerprint, about the same.  So if neither works from the start I simple enter in the 4 digit pin.  No big deal. As to battery life, I find it improved over the previous Galaxy S10e I was using.  I am not disappointed in my purchase and firmly believe others reading the reviews, don't let the 1 and 2 star reviews guide you.  I think this is a fine phone and will see going forward if I feel a need to change my review.","November 30, 2023"

2506,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,Lonnie,5,"Start to finish, this is an absolutely incredible phone. Previously having owned the S22 Ultra, which was also spectacular, I couldn't be more pleased with this model.If you've never had an ultra model, you need to grab this.If you're coming from another ultra, the upgrades are noticeable, but not revolutionary. While the front camera technically dropped MP from the 22, the actual sensor and software prove it to actually outperform it.You really can feel the power behind the device when switching between various memory intensive apps. It stays quick and snappy, never taking a moment to breathe or needing to catch up.I personally go into dev options and turn up the animation speeds. I also grabbed the nova launcher to really take advantage of just how much real estate you have on this screen size, but the stock launcher is definitely past acceptable!The S pen is used every single day for so many different little things, the least of which is drawing.I could go on about how much I'm in love with this thing, but that doesn't really impress upon you just how good it really is.

2508,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,Adam Hamrick,5,"The screen and camera on this phone are both absolutely incredible. Last 2 phones I had were a Galaxy S8 for personal use and an iPhone 13 Pro for work, and this blows both out of the water and is replacing both. I've only had it for a couple weeks and I could gush about it much more than anyone would read, but its a great phone. Great hardware, great software. I'm still getting used to how big it is, I actually prefer smaller phones but I figured I'd give this a try. It has a lot of great features and good software design though that compensate for the size and make it still one hand useable. The pen is fun too.This phone has so many features I've watched dozens of those ""50 things you didn't know you could do with the S23 Ultra"" type YouTube videos and am still learning new things. Its still super user friendly, you can pick it up and do all the things you'd expect a smartphone to do no problem, but then you can also get really into it and discover a ton of awesome extra features it has to play with.Fit and finish is nice too, I got the green and I wish it was more green and less grey, but it still looks and feels nice. Very premium feel with the nice glass, metal sides, and whatever material the back is, I don't even know.Seamless integration with both Samsung and third party peripherals like headphones, watches, etc. I think Samsung is catching up to Apple in terms of its ecosystem integration, plus unlike apple it works just as well with third party and other android devices as it does other Samsung devices.Awesome phone, I'll have this one a long time I think","August 5, 2023"

2510,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,Mark,5,"I like both iPhones and Android phones for different reasons and keep both in the family. The Samsung S23 is the best Android phone I've ever used, and that includes recent offerings from OnePlus, Google, Motorola and LG.Having used both phablet-style phones and smaller devices, I find myself gravitating toward the smaller S23. For me, it's just easier to grip, lighter and much easier to put in a pocket.Usually you have to sacrifice something between either speed or battery life. I'm happy to say this phone is both super speedy and has fabulous battery life despite the smaller size of the battery compared to the phablets. I can easily get through a day of moderate to heavy use, up to two days if my usage is a bit lighter.The screen is the best I've used on any phone, including the latest iPhone 15 Pro. It just has a pop to it with vibrant colors that don't feel overdone. Samsung's Android customizations are excellent and very helpful overall. Some complain about software bloat on Samsung phones, but this unlocked version doesn't seem to be loaded down.I'm not a camera expert, but in casual use, I find the camera on the Samsung S23 to be right up there with the iPhone 15 Pro. They are both very high quality cameras. You won't be disappointed.","December 17, 2023"
2511,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,Artak,4,"This is one of the cheapest snapdragon 8 gen 2 phones you can get if you snagged it during Prime Day. I can finally play Genshin Impact at 60 fps without lag! I came from a Galaxy S10E and the size of the base model is perfect and similar. I used to have to use my S10E's hotspot to play Genshin on my 2021 iPad mini. With the new Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor it can keep up with the iPad mini's A15 so I was able to sell it!I love that there's a stop charging at 85% feature. I used to have to root to get such features.A few reasons for the 4 star rating... The side thumb fingerprint reader of the S10E was superior. It was faster, had less false readings, and was not in the way of a screen protector.The camera is also lackluster with a lot of noise and artifacts. It feels like there's too much post-processing going on and AI doesn't seem to get it right. I'm not sure if it's a software issue and hope Samsung improves it with newer updates.I also miss the microSD slot, and headphone jack. To compensate for the lack of microSD, I pre-ordered a sharge disk to get portble blazing fast nVME storage with this phone usb-c port. As for the headphone jack unfortunately, I'm stuck with using a 3.5mm to usb c adapter for that as well. I have galaxy buds but I still prefer wired at times...","July 22, 2023"
2512,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,goldenrod,5,"I have had this phone for about six months and it is the best phone I have ever had. It outclasses my previous S9+ by leaps and bounds. It also has a camera that out performs current Apple phones. The S23 Ultra feels like a phone from 2-3 years in the future, like it has skipped a generation of models. The display is quick and beautifully detailed. The battery has a good capacity, suiting the phone's power consumption, so you do not need to charge it more than daily. But the most phenomenal aspect is the camera! Take a photo in the 200megapixel mode and view it in Gallery. You can zoom in to your heart's content, the photos are perfect, crisp, and vivid. The file size (7mb-115mb) created by the camera necessitates a large storage capacity that is available in this phone. The S23 Ultra is awesome!","February 4, 2024"
2513,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,FrozzyFroFro,4,"I agonized over this decision-it's a lot of money! The first thing I noticed is the weight. It's heavy. Heavier than my S20 plus. The next thing I noticed is how awkward it is on my hand. Yes, it is a bit bigger, but the corners make it downright difficult for me. I'm an average sized woman with average sized hands, and this phone is just uncomfortable to hold. I even considered returning it because of the corners and waiting until the next one comes out. Having said all of that, I've noticed an appreciable difference in the photos between my S20+ and the S23 ultra. The quality is definitely much better. That will be a plus for my business. I have not even begun to explore the many features, but one of my new favorites is the gridline in the photos. For product photos, they are awesome. I'll update as I learn more about it, but you'll probably want to get a holder loop for it if you are not a guy with larger hands.","October 20, 2023"

I also have a S10e which I previously purchased in renewed condition as a secondary phone (work).First of all since I preordered this I also got the Gift Card. Phone came in new and sealed condition. Effectively it is the 256gb version as described. It ""feels"" thicker than both S10 models but according to the official specs it is actually a little bit thinner. This S23 is a little bit bigger than the S10e (as expected) and a little bit smaller than the S10 which is nice! All three phones are about the same width, so one handed operation is possible. From the 256gb, about 210-215gb is available. I applied a screen protector and I had to enable touch sensitivity from the settings menu because the fingerprint sensor failed to read my fingerprints every time, with that option ""enabled"" it works perfectly fine so take this in mind when applying screen protectors. Battery life is very good it can now last me a full day of charge compared to my old S10 models. Screen quality and brightness are excellent, 120Hz mode is a whole new experience. Camera and video quality are also very good and very fast to process. I migrated every app from my S10 to the S23 and the only ""problem"" I encountered was with Whatsapp since I thought I only needed the code they send to my phone number to activate it on the new phone, BUT now it appears you must not delete the app on the old phone because you need it to actually get the code ""transferred"" to the new phone, a whole awkward process that can be frustrating, especially in the scenario where you previously sold the older phone before acquiring the new one.

The thing can last a full day for me doing normal stuff. The Adaptive Battery is really something. Also I can finally make use of Super Fast Charging. (My old phone was on the verge of dying, so I never had the ability to use that feature.) But the yeah phone is nice. Please treat it with care and get yourself a case while you're at it. Oh and the phone came fully unlocked. So much so when I started it up, it had a list of providers it supported. I 611 on metro did the phone transfer and got my new phone connected in minutes. The thing that as is a nice bonus I think is the 5G UC. But I need to stress test that. Supposedly you get smoother reception with the antenna in crowded areas. Not too sure about though. But I live in Miami. Perfect Environment for a Stress test. 😅Side Note: I using Amazon Monthly Payments for mine. I'm broke. But I mean, I did before with my laptop I got last winter.

Muy buenos ángulos de visión y nivel de brillo que en pleno sol siempre podrás ver el contenido de la pantalla.El rendimiento en juegos no tiene nada que ver con el Snapdragon de 1 generación ya que se calentaba demasiado y su rendimiento caía en picada. Con este nuevo Snapdragon gen2 no tengo esos problemas ya que se calienta muy poco y su refrigeración mejorada logra muy buena estabilización de rendimiento en jornadas mas largas. Lo probé en genshin impact, tower of fantasy y en muchos otros juegos muy demandantes y en todos los juego puedo decir que no bajo de los 60fps y era algo que con el Snapdragon de gen1 no podía decir.En cuanto a el tamaño, si te gustan los móviles pequeños no te recomiendo comprarlo este celular es inmenso y en lo personal es lo que me encanta, si tienes manos pequeñas te será difícil usarlo con solo una mano pero igualmente lo puedes usar.Si te conectas a dispositivos bluetooth como parlantes, televisiones, audífonos nunca tuve ninguna interrupción de conexión .Los parlantes son muy contundentes suenan fuerte y con buen bajo.

I'm excited to take more pictures.The loading time on apps is instant and there is no delay when clicking on an app or using Chrome. Web pages load faster than my old phone. I'm getting full speed from my xfinity modem and I'm getting over 500 mb/s when I do a speed test.The pen is a nice feature I didn't expect to like it so much. It is comfortable to hold and sensitive when you touch the screen and has an instant response time when using it. It has its own battery and a long battery life.I upgraded from a Galaxy s9 which is over 5 years old to a new phone . I upgraded because I couldn't get my phones battery to last more than 5 hours a day.Overall I give it a 5 star review because the main selling point was the 5000 mAh battery. I would recommend it to anyone who's battery doesn't last the whole day.,"July 25, 2023"
2529,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,Ashley E Peterson,5,"Writing this review roughly 3 months after owning this phone and using it daily. It's worked like a dream ever since day one, speaking from someone who's switched back and forth from iPhone to Samsung over the years. I can say that I prefer Samsung because of all the unique features, performance and build quality. The only real issue I had with the phone at first was that for whatever reason my text messages wouldn't send, but after a quick restart they did, so I wrote it off as being a carrier related bug. Aside from that, it's still the best phone that I've bought to date considering that my previous phone (The iPhone 13) which isn't that old at all, only ever gave me weird issues and poor battery life. Overall I can say that switching back to Samsung was so worth it some key features I like about this phone is how Customizable it is, as well as the 200x lens, and the 120hz screen. Not to mention the battery life is amazing, I can take it off the charger around 6:30 in the morning, and by the time I'm getting ready for bed which is typically around Midnight, I'm still left with anywhere from 30-40%. Granted it depends in how much I use the phone throught the day but thats typically the average percentage.","August 24, 2023"

I Also dropped my phone In a nice size  puddle while it was raining didn't notice until I was in the car about to pull off  phone was wet I wiped it off tested all my functions to make sure my speaker still worked and what not phone was fine  I put it in rice when I got back home just to be on safe side,"August 14, 2023"

The permission settings can not be modified so I just deleted Alexa on this phone and now the phone works great. Not sure of any other ways to keep the Alexa app without having issues with the volume***CHANGED RATING TO 5 STARS***I wish I would have kept my S20+ (I may go back to it because I still have it). I should have carefully read the reviews. Like so many others have said - SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THE VOLUME. It is way too low, like the person on the other end is whispering. I have the volume on max and I'm still struggling to hear people. Even the social media videos are playing super low. I keep waiting for an update, but I am running out of patience. I can barely hear anything on this phone (videos, regular calls, Zoom calls, ANYTHING involving sound).Samsung needs to fix this asap. I don't care about the number of pixels per picture. First and foremost, it is a PHONE.I am very disappointed. I have always had a Samsung, back when they had the S9! But I am seriously considering an iPhone because this should be an easy fix for Samsung and they will not address it. And yes, I already reached out to the manufacturer directly.","August 29, 2023"
2533,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,Amazon Customer,3,"I bought this phone after having iPhones for 8 years in protest to Apple's overreliance to China.  After 7 months with this S23 Ultra, here are my observations.-Camera is simply awesome.  It can do anything you need it to, anywhere and in any lighting.-Battery life is great for such a big phone.  One day of normal use leaves me with 40-50% battery when put on the charger at night.-Screen clarity is very good.-Will not sync with my Chevy truck.  Apparently, this is an ongoing problem with the droid platform that I did not know about until using this phone.-Bixby, the Samsung version of Siri, is very intrusive.  Makes random calls to people in my contacts and will take over the screen sometimes when I'm using the phone.  When I opted out of Bixby, I was told it would take a week to deactivate.  Why? So Bixby can take it's time harvesting more of my information???-Face recognition is so bad, I stopped using that feature.-Speaker is pretty good.I had high hopes for this phone, but it did not deliver.  Not sure if I'll go back to an iPhone or try another droid.","February 29, 2024"

S23 Ultra Camera takes perfect videos and clear pics and with pic editing so easy to use.I also got the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro, very comfortable and secure in the ears, clear with dynamic sound, perfect for personal listening, also easy to use. Pair to the TV sound system and don't miss news or movies when working in the kitchen. Fully charged, listen for about 5 hours to then quickly charge- guessing 18 minutes.","March 14, 2024"
2537,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,Sashane,5,"I have only one criticism... why did they put the stylus at the lower left corner?  Most of us are right-handed and the upper right is the obvious best location.  So I never use the stylus - even though it is very useful - due to the hassle of getting it in and out of the socket.Other than that - great phone!  Flawless performance, truly stunning screen that everyone comments on, much louder speaker than earlier phones.  I have a lot of stuff loaded; apps, pics, music and not even bumping up near half of the memory.I transitioned from a 21Ultra and there were several items I needed to handle, so the change wasn't as seamless as earlier phones.  But who cares - it was fun.Camera is ridiculously good.  I know a Pulitzer Price winning photographer works for a major paper, and she carries this phone because of the camera.","September 11, 2023"
2538,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,Ken Hahn,5,"I've used this smartphone for several months & am very satisfied with it. I don't like big phones & was happy to learn that Samsung kept this version of the S23 at the same dimensions of the J3 that it replaced. I knew going in that it has a sealed battery, so I treat it as carefully as I can regarding when to charge, etc. I, like most others, wish the battery charge lasted longer, but I only have to charge it every 2-3 days given my light usage of primarily family texting & a rare phone call. I find the display to be sharp & readable & the limited audio features I use are excellent. All & all, I'm very pleased with the phone.","January 28, 2024"
2539,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,Commander Toasty,3,"I upgraded from an S20+ that I absolutely adored. I wasn't looking to upgrade. My S20+ glass finally broke after many drops in 3+ years. It was a champ.The upgrade process was decent but lacking. Some settings were lost and app logins didn't transfer over (except for Google logins).  I have tons of apps and STILL have not fully recovered from the migration. The S23+ supposedly has an eSim but Verizon was unable to find/use the eSmin during the activation process. I had to pull the physical sim from the S20+ and put it in the S23+.I feel confident that the functional capabilities will be fine. It's a Samsung. It's Android.  I have had the S23+ less than a day, so I cannot yet comment on the compute power, battery, etc. I have found the camera quality of the S23+ to be far superior than that of the S20+.I've been having problems with cell signal with the S20+ and suspected the radio might be going bad. Not so. The S23+ isn't getting any better signal, so the issue is with Verizon.So far, my biggest gripe about the S23+ is that it looks and feels like an iPhone.  If I wanted an iPhone, I would have bought one. The S20+ was thin and sleek, with the glass rounded over on the sides. It felt young, vibrant, and sleek, like a cool race car. The S23+ feels bulky and stodgy. It's thicker, shorter, and heavier.  It just doesn't feel as good or natural in the hand.  :(So advice: if you are an iPhone user and you want to try out an Android device, this is the phone for you. If you are a long time Samsung Galaxy Android user, look elsewhere.","August 25, 2023"

Other reviewers may have gotten a bad phone or need to do a software update.The performance and battery life aren't noticeably better than my old OnePlus 7 phone,  but I wasn't expecting them to be. Phone processors seem to have plateaued over the last few years.I don't have an opinion on the out of the box organization or design of the OS.

I had to delete a lot of pre-installed apps but that's fine with me.The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the fingerprint reader is on the screen, when I used to it on the back. I feel like it's a more convenient spot. It's also has a tendency to not recognize my finger. Also, while it charges in a half hour or less, the battery doesn't last long if youre addicted to screen time. I love my new phone regardless and would recommend it.Just a side note, this phone has the privacy feature where a green dot shows up in the corner to let you know if your camera and microphone are being accessed.","August 20, 2023"

Make sure you keep your old phone around so you can use Samsung Smart Switch (if you have a Samsung) to transfer *almost* everything to the new phone; I wasn't able to transfer the applications 'Videos' and 'Video Downloader' which came pre-installed with the S21U but that wasn't an issue for me.As mentioned, I use Verizon and all I had to do to get everything up and running was move my SIM from my old phone to the new one. I did this AFTER I completed the initial setup on the new phone (it'll ask you in setup to choose your carrier, I skipped this so I could use Smart Switch to make sure everything was transferred first).This is my first unlocked phone and I'll definitely be doing this from now on!","November 28, 2023"

2546,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,Kyrstan Young,4,"Wanted to upgrade to this phone, but there seems to be a problem when trying to transfer my sizeable music library from my computer to the internal storage of the phone.  The transfer stops somewhere in the middle for some reason.  I tried through the USB cable, and also through the ShareIt app, but both methods have the same problem.  Tried transferring in smaller chunks.  Tried a factory reset.  Same problem.  Tried to continue copying the remaining uncopied files, but it would not proceed.  Found a few other people on reddit experiencing this.  Not sure what is going on.  Returned the phone as a result.  Considering whether to try another unit.UPDATE:  Ordered a replacement, but encountered the same problem.  So i believe it is a general phone issue with the S23 Ultra.  However, i decided to try the Smart Switch app to transfer my sizeable music library to this phone.  It worked.  It copied my library completely.  So you can't do a successful desktop to phone copy, but you can do an old phone to new phone copy using Smart Switch.  You can select what files you want to copy using the custom option.","May 8, 2023"
2547,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,Kyrstan Young,5,"1.  Battery comes completely discharged.  You will need to charge it.  It takes a bit to show it is charging.  Be patient, especially if using the supplied cable.  Recommend purchasing an ac adapter for quick charging that fits your specific phone, ie 25W or 40W.2.  Inserting a SIM card from your carrier:  ""SIM not registered on network""  "" SIM not allowed""...Get the IMEI number from ""SETTINGS"" ""ABOUT PHONE"".  Copy that number down.  Call your carrier and provide them with that number...it'll make your life a whole lot easier than googling the faults and trying all the crap out there running you in various directions except the right one.3.  Transferring data and files from your old phone using the supplied cable is PAINLESS!  You will have to open and log into all your apps again on your new phone.3.  Download from Play Store the app for your carrier....it helps manage your phone.4.  If you plan on doing facial recognition or fingerprints, wait until after you install a screen protector if you plan to do so.5.  Enjoy your phone...it's awesome!","August 17, 2023"
2548,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,rob thomas,5,"I am a longtime samsung user, and I have been very happy with all the various items I've owned, after having the note 10+ for a few years I decided it was time for an upgrade. I had many options available to me but after hearing about the processor this phone has + the amazing camera I decided to take a chance with this. Boy I'm glad I did, setup was a breeze, navigation is simple, the phone feels solid, it's fast and feels great to the touch. I was disappointed that no charger came with it and no option for SD card. However there is plenty of space with the 500+GB. Also I purchased a 45w charger and it works great, charges fast. I will say this, unless you only want the phone for basic use the battery does drain a bit quicker than other samsung phones I've owned. Now onto the camera, as a photographer I am always looking for options other than a bulky camera, so when I heard the camera had up to 100x zoom I was enthralled. The picture quality is amazing but does suffer a bit with longer range zoom. The night view works great for taking pictures in low light environments. And let's face it who doesn't enjoy a selfie, the selfie camera give excellent pictures. For the price I say the Samsung S23ultra is definitely a great phone and well worth the investment","May 8, 2023"

The lavander is a nice color and it beautiful in clear or clear cases with designs. Battery is great as well. On some days I work 12hr shifts and still have over 70% when I leave work.

Make sure you get a phone case to protect this baby....***PREVIOUS REVIEW: The phone I received was factory reset and locked out due to google verification.Not a knock on the device itself as I'm sure it's up to par but the phone that I received in the mail was unusable. I purchased BRAND NEW and the phone did actually look brand new but once I unboxed it and powered it on it told me that the device needed a google login that was previously synced to the device....meaning it's not brand new and could possibly be stolen.

I chuckle at my husband having to have a charger cord with him at all times.  The S22+ were subject to die when you are in the middle of something.  The 23 Ultra I don't have to worry about that at all!  I also finally watched some videos/movies from my phone.  Such a huge difference between the two.  The picture, it's just simply fantastic!I absolutely love this phone! I tried through Samsung and Verizon, both were talking much for me to mention! I thought let's try Amazon and there it was in all its glory unlocked and waiting for me. All I did was slip my Sim card from my other phone into here and I'm off and running! This is the first phone I have owned outright right out the door and I couldn't be happier! I'm a big Samsung fan and will never give them up.The S23 Ultra surpasses my expectations. The size Ultra perfect, yes big, but still. The keyboard is big enough to where I may not have to get another app to use. The smart switch worked way better than before even saving some password info, the majority actually. Sound is magnificent! Camera is gorgeous!  I definitely recommend this phone!

2553,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,amanda,3,"Buyer beware....for someone who did not know the complete ins-and-outs of buying a cell phone from a 3rd party this has been a hard and expensive lesson to learn. Since this is a 3rd party ""unlocked"" cell phone it may or  may not have all the features that you are use to with a phone you purchased from your provider. For instance, Verizon will not allow video calling. So you are forced to use the google Meet Up option which then does not allow you to do a simple thing like switch over to a video call when on a regular call. You have to end the call and then use the google video to call, or start the call as video. Not a huge big deal, but an annoyance when wanting to do a quick switch over to video when on a call. Contacted Verizon, Samsung and Amazon. Finger pointing galore, but no resolution. Also, for whatever reason, I also do not get 5G any more, but it defaults to 4G. Again, not a huge deal, but yet another annoyance with the whole cell phone thing. It's a good phone, takes great pictures, but be aware of the possible issues with buying it from a 3rd party versus your provider. Amazon will not help out with this issue, nor will Samsung, so you are on your own.","September 9, 2023"

The only problem I have with that is that the resolution is higher so when I send pictures to people with phones that don't support the resolution, the pictures shows up like blurry or pixels. On my end it looks perfect but on someone else's end, it looks blurry. Not sure if there is a fix, I have yet to figure that out. Also, the notification settings are different on this phone and I can't seem to get them to show up the way I had them on my old phone. Again, not sure if there is a way around it.

2558,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,Gary P Jones,4,"Having owned the s20+ I was accustomed to its size. The Ultra is a large phone, too large my liking but it is what it is. Placing in your fron pocket is not recommended, I place this in my rear pocket and it takes up all of my rear pants pocket, 5'10 185. The stylus pen is a little awkward to remove and worse if you have a a good case for your phone as you have to dig for it. Apps are are standard for what i use, and fucntion properly. I find the fingerprint to be quirky and sensitive. It attempts to read your print instantly, any improper placement on first try touch will give you incorrect reading. In past I can place finger and settle it on spot before it woud try to read, not this one. The camera is a nice upgrade, with great quality and features.

I was afraid it would be a bloated mess with Bixby and all sorts of Samsung apps.  It turns out that the phone is an amazingingly well engineered device that easily allows you to get rid of most of the Samsung apps.  The phone is light years better in T Mobile 5G performance and speed over the Oneplus 9 Pro.  The S23 hardware is solid.  The audio and video quality is excellent+, the networking is excellent+, the battery is way better than the OP9P, and NONE of my apps have had any problems working, the software is excellent too.  Its as if Android app developers test first on the Samsung phones to make sure they work (Just like Apple test theirs phones and apps)  With the OP9P, I would occasionally have the apps just refuse to work, not sure why.  Even Bluetooth worked perfectly on the S23Ultra.Overall, I am super happy with Samsung and am glad to be back to their phones after a 10 year detour to other brands.","May 18, 2023"

I do have a cover on it that's cleared to work with fingerprints, but it still won't read it and barely read it prior to the cover anyway.Not a fan of the edge screen limitations.

2562,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23,AK,5,"I recommend this phone if you have the money or wait for a good deal. I have the 12gb of ram with the 512gb of storage and I have only had maybe one or two problems, but that was on the first update of One Ui 5.1 where the phone was connected to wifi and I did not get any internet access and I had to restart my phone but besides that the phone is very fast and snappy. The cameras are very great quality and the display is as well. The Phone also charges very fast and the battery will last me into the next day or more. I might be wrong but the battery life on this phone is probably the best on the market at the moment. Samsung is not selling the exynos chip sets with these phones this year which is good because snapdragon has proven to be way better. The S-pen is very useful for photo editing, taking photos, taking notes, and even drawing. Sometimes I'll connected the phone to a display and use DEX to watch a movie and I use the S-pen as a remote. The phone also very obviously integrated with Google. You dont have to us the Samsung applications on this phone because it runs on android but the Samsung apps are also very useful. Software experience is very smooth as well.

2563,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,TheRevenite,5,"Look, I love my Motorola Edge Plus 2023.  It's a great phone.  Really.  And it costs around 2/3 or less than this phone.  I considered their foldable phone to save some money.  Truth be told, they look identical and both this Samsung Galaxy Z Flip5 and the Motorola Razr+ 2023 are extremely similar but we have pros and cons with each.When shopping, I found the Razer+ charged faster and has larger screens.  However, it lacks the performance the Z Flip5 has due to the Z Flip5 having a newer generation processor.  It's not like Motorola didn't have access to the same processor, they did, but to save our pockets, they opted for a generation behind.  Not a deal breaker, but when you catch, like I did, the Z Flip on sale, well, that cost difference becomes less of an issue.Both phone are about as scratch resistant as you can get.  That is my way of saying the first thing I'd do with any phone is put a case on it and put quality screen protectors.  So neither phone wind here .The fact I have three really nice WearOS Samsung watches essentially made the decision for me.  It's sad Samsung disables ECG if you're not using a Samsung phone.  A plus for Samsung is I can now transfer my watch to a new phone or transfer it back to the same phone if I reset the phone.  This prevents having to reset and clear the watches.  Another thing Samsung has done is these phones will desltect you've switched watches and syncs all the health data, alarms, and other items you've set on the watch.  That option is omitted with any other phone.I love this phone.  I like the nice squared sides and flat screen.  It took me a little bit to get used to the small divet where the screen folds, but now I barely notice it.Would I recommend this phone at MSRP? No.  If it hasn't gone on sale and saved me over $300, I'd be writing a review on the Motorola Razr.If the Z Fold is too large for you, this is a perfect compromise.  Folded, it's half the size of my Motorola Edge+ and thinner!The battery life is really all day.  That's seems to be rare these days outside of extremely large and expensive flagship phones.  This phone feels sturdy, so I don't feel like I'm going to break it opening and closing it but a good case is a must.  Bare, this phone is slick and I don't mean just in looks!I really couldn't be happier.  It's fast so gaming is nice and smooth, the refresh rate and color quality allows movies to really look great, and surprisingly, this small phone has pretty loud speakers for their size.The only ""problem"" I have it I get interrupted when I take a call and people see me unfold it.I really am comfortable that the screen will last, and if it doesn't, I have the Amazon insurance.  My really large gripe here is with Samsung directly.  I tried to sign up for their replacement warranty the moment the phone was set up and they require all these diagnostic reports and video proof of virtually every angle while the phone is on running the diagnostics.  Ummm, not everyone has the means to do this and why should I have to since I just purchased the phone and Amazon is an authorized dealer!I'd definitely would buy it again if I needed to.  I don't think you'd be disappointed","June 21, 2024"
2564,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,ScooterTrash,5,"I've always been a flip phone girl,so I waited several years to treat myself! This phone is the best, the mint color is really pretty, all the features are great, this phone is unlocked so it was easy to transfer at the store.  I absolutely love it!","August 16, 2024"
2565,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,TheRevenite,5,"I moved over from iphone, and haven't looked back. The folding feature is ACTUALLY useful on a daily basis for either more comfortable use, taking pictures, or multi-tasking. The outside screen is especially nice for photos.No issues with the hinge, 90% of the time I forget the crease is there.I hate how large most phones are, but small phones are difficult to use, so this is a perfect middle ground of being compact but also having a good size screen.I don't have any issues with the durability, but I never drop phones and haven't even broken a screen protector before, so someone with a more haphazard use pattern for their phone will probably be at risk of scratching/damaging the soft inner screen.The facial detection is not great for me, but I have an unusual face so even iphones struggle. The fingerprint reader is good, misreads are infrequent. I wish I could add more prints, as being such a strange form factor means I use different fingers to open it often.Battery is great, you can easily use it all day, even in bright conditions or cold weather.","March 5, 2024"
2566,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,ROBIN,1,"Update; I bought a Motorola and the software is much better. They let you run anything on the cover and if it doesn't work that's on the developer and you can delete it from the cover.  Has more people have cover screens more developers will support it.  Samsung software really sucks.  I'm a retired Amazon software engineer.THE BAD: I was sad to see it doesn't have a telephoto lens. I don't think I used it that much, but none of my photo apps allowed me to quickly search for the use of the different lenses.I was very disappointed the way Samsung migrated my Samsung watch- it didn't.Several of the cases I bought did not work because they were blocking the wide-angle lens at least partially.The cover screen is great but the tools that come with Samsung make it barely usable. I added GOOD LOCK to it from the Galaxy Store & now it does betterThe Google dialer didn't work with the cover screen and I had to revert to the Samsung phone dialer but that's fine.THE GOOD:  the form factor is great. I really like putting a smaller phone in my pocket although it is thicker.Without installing Good Lock I would be very disappointed but that makes it all usable.  Leaving it folded up looks like it will fill at least half of my uses.Summary:  I think it's a game changer. It's great hardware but as normal I'm underwhelmed by Samsung's software.","August 14, 2023"
2567,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Cody Claus,5,What's not to like about the z-flip. It give you a compact phone when closed so that you can easily put it in your front pocket and it's not in the way of things. Then you flip it open to a full sized smart phone. Yo can set it at a 90 degree type on the bottom half and see everything on the top half. This works great for taking photos and video as well.,"July 4, 2024"
2568,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,ScooterTrash,4,"if your goal is to use your phone less then fine it is helpful for actually making a conscious effort to close the phone and put it away when you are not using it. you do have full functionality with the smaller screen but every time you actually want to use it, you have to open it up. this requires effort and gets tiring. sometimes you want to take a quick pic it would require an extra step to open.face recognition on all samsung phones are subpar compared to iphone. physical fingerprint scanner works okay but is a bit small. would require a couple of taps. battery life is actually pretty good. should last full day under light usage.crease in the middle is ugly. does not have samsung dex. s series offer the better camera set up. overall cool design and concept but still too many compromises and too much work to use","February 20, 2024"
2569,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Dan,5,"Very cute phone and the glass is gorilla glass so it doesn't feel fragile. I've had it for a few months and it has survived a couple falls without a single scratch or crack (like it still looks brand new). The ability to fold also reminds me of a ds or gameboy which is good for the nostalgia feeling. The phone is also able to run games like Genshin Impact and rhythm tappers no problem with maxed settings and no lag at all. The back camera can also be used as a front camera which is great for better camera quality. Good upgrade from my old phone! Just note that it has NO headphone jack and NO sd card slot which is mildly annoying, but overall not a big deal. As a preorder bonus I actually got double the storage space, but even so, I'm nowhere near halway storage use so I wouldn't worry about lack of external storage for a long while.The battery itself takes awhile to fully charge, but it lasts a long time. With constant use and power saving mode turned off, the phone battery lasts me about 14 hrs.If you download Good Lock (samsung app) on the phone, you'll be able to do a lot more with it. For example, you can add more apps to the back screen along with be able to change app icons for more customisation.","September 23, 2023"

My first ever phone was a flip phoneas a preteen and now i get to actually experience a flip with modern day features. The phone takes a bit to get used to with all the extra steps, pairing my Bluetooths and going from strictly having apple for years to now a Samsung.Some cool features i like is being able to fold the phone closed to end calls, when folded it fits in my little purse/my pocket, being able to give contacts there own title and widgets/themes that directly go to the app its assigned to 😁😁😁APPLE JUST LOST A CUSTOMER, I WILL NOT BE GOING BACK.

2572,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,GoingOnLevels,5,"The phone in itself has so many features that come in handy and are so useful, for example if you want to take a group picture, you can prop it up, wave your hand from afar and it will capture the picture for you. I love the fact I have the cover screen where I can have live wallpaper of my favorite anime or my own personal picture and it will show on the screen. I won't have to open my phone once to reply to messages, get my notifications and even watch youtube. I have owned a Samsung for years now and I love how I can customize anything and everything. You need to try this phone out for yourself.","June 20, 2024"
2573,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,TheRevenite,3,"I like this phone and I want to love it. being advertised as a selfie phone it sure takes bad photos. I thought it was just my settings or that I gained weight but nope it really distorts the image. Pretty sad Bec it's convenient to take photos in this but the results are just bad. And customer service has no clue... At all! Seen similar problems on Reddit too. Hello Samsung do something! I do not have a short stubby nose nor does my face shaped like a hamburger. With that said, everything else is cool. I mean it's nice I can have a wallpaper of Gojo winking at me on both screens. Pretty cool! You can also utilize the small screen for everything when phone is closed. Facebook discord calls Spotify everything that app will allow you to (you do have to install this app forgot what it's called but you'll be guided in the Samsung store) Which is fun but I personally like the opening and closing mechanism. Especially withending a phone call lol. Those born in the 80s-90s get it. If you're tired of the tablet iPhone this is a nice change except the camera makes me look like Shrek.. Few things on battery in the begining it doesn't seem to last a full day now it does but I do charge everyday unliek my iPhone 12 max, other features like face recognition not as intuitive as apples! Same with their fingerprint.. it doesn't respond as well it's buggy. the texting on keyboard when you make a mistake is slightly different than just long pressing.. to me apples is easier and ive been a user for both phones. Yeah if all these things bother you, Buyer beware. Do I regret it 50/50 just cause my iPhone is still here... And I do like how customizable it is however Iam not satisfied with just beinging this phone alone with me when I go out which defeats the purpose of it being a small fit everywhere phone and a selfie phone lol.","April 1, 2024"

2585,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Honesty I,3,"I purchased this for my wife to replace her 5+ year old phone, and we did the proper charging by letting it run down all the way then charge it all the way back up, then repeated the process several times. The battery runs down faster than her 5 year old phone. I have disabled as many of the apps I felt comfortable with, and switched the energy setting to lite mode (if I remember the term correctly). It still runs down faster than it should and she ends up using her old phone for some things just to keep from running the battery down on the this one. Sadly this is not what I expected and hoped. If anyone has any other suggestions to improve the battery, I would love to hear about it, other than just turning it off which she does at night too.","January 24, 2024"
2586,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Tamara Preston,1,"I just got this phone at the end of may 2024 . There is no damage to this phone that I have done myself. And I paid full price for the phone. There was no problem until now.  The protective black strip pulled up off the left hinge Exposing the glass underneath.. and on the right side of the phone, it wants to come off on the right hinge also. The customer service Has changed for Samsung And not in a good way, You have to fight to get a human on the line they want to text you or talk to AI . it was so hard to get a hold of someone and they told me it was going to cost me three hundred and forty something dollars to ship my phone to Samsung to be fixed Because the hinge is not under warranty. And I would not have my phone for a week or more. All  for them to replace the black protective strip on the phone.  I have been with Samsung for I don't know how long. Even with a year warranty through samsung and full coverage through my the cell phone service, i'm still going to have to pay three hundred and fifty dollars to have it fixed. When the whole phone should be fully replaced. I was willing to let them fix it until they told me I had to pay that amount When I just paid full price for the phone.

2595,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Purrpurrfectly,2,"PROS: Coming from an S22 Ultra, the Flip form factor felt incredible. Carrying this phone in your pocket and holding it in your hand is such a delight due to the smaller size significantly lighter weight. The small outside screen is awesome, once you figure out the apps you need to install in order to maximize its use. Being able to use the outside cameras for selfies and the ability to show people what the photo will look like while taking a picture is a really cool feature.CONS: Let's start with saying I had to return the phone. Although I was enjoying my time with the phone, the thing started to get HOT. I had to turn off the Always On Display, use Low Performance Mode, and Dim the Screen just to be able to give it normal use. Even then, the battery life leaves a lot to be desired. I had to charge the phone multiple times during the day just to be able to get through the day without the thing dying. The overheating and battery issues are definitely related and, unfortunately, an issue that I just couldn't get past.SUMMARY: I am hopeful these issues can be addressed in a future iterance of the phone. I really enjoyed the time that I has with the phone and debated multiple times whether to return it. Unfortunately, the overheating and battery life is are important factors that can't be ignored.

I tried powering off the phone and restarting it. I even went to a repair shop to see if it was a small fix. They took one look at it and told me they couldn't do anything and to contact the seller I got it from. I am disappointed that in so short of a time frame I am having issues with this phone.

2659,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,M Mullins,5,"My last phone was a Samsung A10e, and anyone coming from a cheap A series phone can for sure tell you that this is a MAJOR upgrade. I got the 128gb S21 FE model and I only paid $590 USD for the black version, despite really really wanting the white version, yet that one was priced at $699 USD. Would I pay $699 for it? Probably not, but everyone has a different budget for everything!When I received the phone, it came in its regular factory box which is very thin, like I was concerned for a second that they just sent me a case, but nope! They've cut down on everything that they send you. It came with the phone, a manual in a tiny box, a sim card tool behind that box, and I believe short type c cable, I already have a charging cable so I didn't pay any attention to it. Not that big of a deal really, it just worried me for a second haha.Now I'm someone who worries about storage, and this phone does NOT come with a micro SD card slot (unlike the S20 FE), however I've not had any problems with my storage yet, I still have roughly 61GB out of the 128GB to go. The system itself is 22.5GB which is expected as this is a very beefy and fast machine, and then I play a lot of games so my apps take around 39GB. I don't take many photos either so I only have around 1GB used, but if you are someone who loves to take photos, I recommend getting a separate portable hard drive or even using your personal computer to send your photos over, as spending $70-$130+ for just 128GB of more storage is a lot when you could use that to get around 500GB on a standalone drive. It is also worth mentioning that getting the bigger storage version for this phone, also adds 2GB of ram to it, giving it a speed boost, but I'm about to go over some things about the phone's speed.As for game wise, I play Genshin Impact, Colorful Stage/Project Sekai, Stardew Valley, Pokemon GO, and Fallout Shelter, and this thing runs them all like a BEAST. I wouldn't recommend getting the extra 2GB of ram in the bigger storage model since this phone can run pretty much anything you throw at it. Anyone who's ever played Genshin Impact knows how heavy the game is, and it can run it at max settings just fine, the only problem, is that it gets INCREDIBLY hot. So hot that it lowkey hurts to touch after playing for more than just 5-15 minutes. This could be completely fixed if you get a cooling mount for around $20-30. I do prioritize game functionality and speed over looks so I do play extremely comfortably in low-medium settings as it still looks great! However if you're looking for a gaming machine with smooth fps and no lag at all with maximum settings on heavy games (since bigger temperatures means lowering the processing of your game, causing lag), I'll have to recommend looking for a different phone such as an Iphone or a Oneplus since they do that well.The camera is good for me! I take photos of my dog and that's it. It also has a 30x zoom which is crazy. The front camera is really good and I sometimes put it up to my head and angle it to make myself look like a goldfish and it's super funny haha. The fingerprint reader works extremely well even with a screen protector. Fun fact I found: you can lay your finger over your fingerprint reader while the screen is off and it'll unlock! So you don't even have to double tap your screen to wake it up or press a power button. I was never a fan of 120hz screens and I still am not, but it looks super smooth when I have it turned on. The AMOLED screen was a huge game changer for me, it's beautiful and has incredible contrasting colors. I know people say they have tons of issues with the battery to this device, but I honestly haven't had any problems whatsoever. Now I do keep medium power saving mode on as I just don't see too much to the use of allowing your phone to do any big background services when you're not using it. It lasts about a day and a half. I work 9-5 and I come home with 70% battery after being on it or checking it very often and frequently. Now I will say there has been some connectivity issues during heavy storms and heavy storms only, but I experienced that issue with my last phone so there's a massive chance that's just my mobile data provider (which is US Cellular). By the way, this phone is unlocked, so it should be able to accept just about any other provider you use. I also think it supports 2 sim cards? I'm not too sure as I'm not someone who would ever have to use it, but if you are, then that's a plus.Overall this phone is absolutely amazing and I 11/10 recommend it :)","August 17, 2022"
2660,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,Shawn,5,"I got my S9 after my S4 crapped out after 5 years (screen went off, wasn't even cracked).  My S4 & S9 served me very well!  I had the S9 for 4+ years it simply is an amazing phone.  I was at a crowded place, and someone knocked my elbow while holding it.  It fell, and the screen cracked pretty bad (not like one crack, many cracks).  Screen still works perfectly, but, I was scared it could stop working at any time.  So, I needed a new phone.  I looked at the S21 FE and S22.  At the time I purchased, the prices were about $200 different (then a week after I purchased, prices were the same!).  But, I'm happy with my purchase.  I liked small phones in the past, never had a bigger one.  I am actually enjoying the larger screen.  Better for viewing content.  I'm a guy and my pants pockets are plenty large for this phone as well.  Feels no different than my previous S9 in my pocket.  I've watched a lot of YouTube reviews of the camera / video quality / test pics and footage, and it seems they are almost the same (sometimes I prefer and think the S21 FE image / video looks better, others the S22 looks better - kind of a toss up).So, what have I noticed?  Well, battery life is amazing!  Beats my S9 by FAR!  Now, my S9 was 4+ years old when I had to replace it (now use the S9 as a ""camera I'm not worried about losing or breaking"").  I had the S9 for a long time, and I cannot remember how good battery life was when I first got it.  But, I don't recall it ever getting worse either.  What I can say is, I used to have to top my S9 up a bit at least once or twice a day.  My S21 FE, lasts ALL DAY (and I even have the battery saver setup so it only charges to 85% - never did that with the S9).  And even from 85%, I get a full day no problem!  Usually around 35% or so when I am ready for bed.  The screen is great.  I do leave on 120hz mode all the time.  I also have dark mode turned on.  I like how it looks, and dark things on screen use less battery than bright white things.  But yes, battery is great.Now the cameras.  My S9 actually had almost identical video.  I make YouTube videos and the S9 did me very well in 4K by 30 or 60.  I do notice the S21 FE is ever so slightly better image.  It also has better stabilization and just some other processing stuff that helps out.  The pictures are better for sure.  I've taken pictures of people and shown them, and they've been like, ""What phone is that?!?  The pictures are sooooo good!""  The S9 did well.  But, the S21 FE is for sure an improvement.  I used to use my G7X Mark ii for most pictures, because it just was better by far than my S9.  Now, I don't think I ever really need that camera anymore.  This phone produces awesome photos!I haven't had a single issues, no glitches, no nothing.  Just a smooth perfectly working phone.  I did kind of like the S9 having the fingerprint reader on the back.  But, I quickly got used to the in screen reader.  It works fast and great.  Apps load fast.  Camera is on in an instant with a double tap of the power button.  Just really nothing to complain about.  I would have kept my S9 another few years, but, I am happy with the S21 FE and hope it lasts me 5+ years as well.Great phone, if you are looking into it and deciding if you want to get it, I for sure recommend it.","July 26, 2022"
2661,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,M Mullins,5,"Edit: I'm a super heavy user.  I'm at about the 6 month, and now the device gets warm when it's taxed or the weather is a little warm.  And the battery life, whuch is still great, and dropped down significantly.  Love the phone.  Very concerned about the longevity. Particularly as i come up on summer in floridamark Edit:  one month in, and I love it!  Battery lasts all day, and I'm on my phone nonstop.I'm used to the change in buttons and actually like them.  Put in settings so power options do come up now. Like the screenshot method, mostly.Got a supcase military grade unicorn beetle case so it's well protected.  Signal is great on tmobile.  5g is slower than 4g, so I turn it off.  but I'm out in the middle of nowhere.Touch screen works perfectly even under double acreen protectors!  Updates get sent all the time.  So worth it!And my mom is blown away by the telephoto lens.  For me it's a fun binoculars, but pretty mushy picture quality at telephoto distance.  S9 couldn't do that at all. The close up distance/focus is much better than my s9.  The rest is pretty similar.---It's only been a couple days but so far so good. None of the touch screen or overheating issues a few people listed on the internet.I took very good care of my S9, but it was overheating often. This is night and day difference.I thought the volume buttons above the power button would take some getting used to, but actually the only downside is taking a screenshot is more difficult. Oh, and the power button no longer turns it off! Although I've read There are some workarounds for that. Otherwise you have to go up in the menu.I love that it's the same width as my old phone, but taller. Gives me more space but I can still hold it.I absolutely hate that there are no good colorful heavy duty cases out for it yet. Come on OtterBox!I wanted to go with the S10 because I was nervous reading reviews, and how new this was. But this was cheaper, and so far I'm very happy with my choice.Please note, red it definitely an orangey red.  I went with red so it would be more visible if all I could find for now was transparent cases. But if I could go back I would definitely choose purple again.I've also read a lot of people turn the 5G off because it's not available everywhere and you don't really want it constantly switching between 4G and 5G. 5G was coming in pretty good for me out in the boonies with T-Mobile. I did switch it to 4G yesterday and that also worked fine during a trip.Transferring information using Smart Switch actually worked really well for me. My S9 main Drive was completely full.  The SD card was half full. This brought over ALMOST everything perfectly, and it wasn't even very slow.  The only things it didn't bring over were  paid apps that I had installed with a different Google account. I had to add the rest of my Google accounts and do those by hand. Not sure if that would have been any different had I installed all the Google accounts first.I would say it's very slightly brighter than my S9. I don't have a problem with the camera being on the screen.Haven't had great luck with a fingerprint yet, but I do need to redo it since I put a screen protector on anyways.Happy happy!","November 27, 2020"
2662,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,Earthling1984,4,"Now that the price on this phone has gone down to $600, it is a very good deal for the price.The Snapdragon 865 processor is more than fast enough for anything I want to do. 6GB of memory is less than some other phones in this price range, but it is still more than enough for most people.The phone feels very solid despite the plastic back. If you use any kind of case, you won't even notice the plastic back.The phone supports 25W fast charging, but for some reason they only included a 15W charger in the box. Buying the 25W charger separately is a waste of money as well as a waste of the natural resources that were used on the 15W charger. Amazon sells decent 25W fast chargers for less than $15, so cheaping out on the charger is a real lame move by Samsung. You can search Amazon for 15W chargers that support ""USB-C PPS"" mode and are UL Certified.The screen looks beautiful when you turn on the 120Hz mode. This does burn your battery more quickly, but the battery is big enough that it still lasts all day.The screen has been very responsive to me. I have read bug reports about screen glitches for some people. Samsung has already released bug fixes that hopefully have fixed this. I advise only buying this phone from an authorized dealer with no hassle returns so you don't have to worry about this bug.The phone does have a lot of Samsung bloatware. I owned a Samsung S-series phone several years ago and the bloatware was really bad then. This one is much better. You don't even need to create a Samsung account to use the phone now. Most of the Samsung bloatware (other than the camera app) won't work if you don't have a Samsung account, but if you never use it, this isn't a problem. There are several tutorials online about disabling all the bloatware if you never want to see any of it on your screen.The triple camera setup on this phone is very good for this price level. The telephone camera works great up to 3X in good light. Image quality deteriorates quickly if you zoom in past 3X or in lower lighting conditions. Telephoto cameras are getting rare in this smartphone price range, so I'm glad this phone has one. I really like using the telephoto lens for landscape and nature photography. The normal and wide angle cameras work better in lower light situations (including indoor situations), though not as good as the iphone or Google Pixel phones. Pictures do tend look more processed than with some other phone cameras. Some people like the Samsung look. Other people prefer more natural looking photos. You should try to look at sample photos before buying the phone, since you cannot completely disable the Samsung photo processing.This phone comes with Android version 10 out of the box, which is one version behind the Android version 11 that the Google Pixel phones are shipping with. Samsung promises software support with 3 version updates, but that is a little misleading since 1 of those version updates will be just to catch up with the current Android version 11. Still, 3 years of bug fixes and security patches is better than what Samsung used to offer.","October 29, 2020"
2663,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,L8rGator,5,"The CPU is fast and the phone has enough RAM to the point where your phone doesn't freeze up opening certain apps. The storage space is generous and the SD card slot area is pretty dope as well. It may seem inconvenient, unless you're upgrading from an android phone that had a back piece where you could take out the battery. The camera shoots in 4K and allows you to focus on an object.For those of you who don't know what 4K is, think 4K HD a certain adult film companies uses cameras of this quality, lmao.The price is reasonable, especially for all the features, storage space, RAM and other specs that this phone has. The camera is on par with most newer iPhones if not better. It's approximately as big as the iPhone 13 Pro Max and faster. I've tested this out personally. The Samsung FE series is quite a refreshing experience. It's well worth the price.Oh ANOTHER THING. If you like decent headphones, this phone sports a newer version of bluetooth connectivity. It will have better connection to wireless earbuds, wireless headphones, smart TVs, bluetooth speakers, cars that support bluetooth, etc.The colors are of a nice variety and the display is beautiful. You can watch videos in 4K quality. It is also, a legit pro gamer phone. No game I've played has ever lagged. The download speed is pretty impressive as well.Overall, if you prefer Samsung phones or great phones at reasonable prices, then I'd recommend this phone via Amazon.The best function is the Bluetooth tethering. You can share your phone's wifi/data with another device WITHOUT it using your mobile hotspot data AND WITHOUT being charged. You can even charge another Qi compatible device off this phone or charge this phone off a Qi compatible device.I apologize for the rant, lol.Also, so far as of June 2022, this is the last high end Samsung phone with a micro SD card slot.You also power off the phone differently. You don't need to hold the ""power button"" on the side of the device. Screenshots are also different. You hold the ""power button"" and the volume down button at the same time for one second.This phone can also block Apple ID. These crazy females won't be calling me from different phone numbers anymore at 3am in the morning!","June 9, 2022"
2664,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,l2,5,"This phone is solid. It's interesting that in 2020, a ""budget"" phone is 700 dollars but it is definitely a great value for the money. The cameras aren't as great as the regular S20 line up but they are a solid upgrade coming from the S8. Just make sure you have great lighting if you plan to use the ultra wide lens or telephoto because photos get very grainy in less than  ideal conditions. Battery life is solid. I work all week and when I'm not on my phone a lot, I easily get 2 days and squeeze  in a few hours from the next day if I really can't get to another charger. If I have a day off and I'm on the phone for hours,  I can easily make it to the end of the day at 20+ percent. The screen is great. Colors are bright and the quality 120 Hz refresh rate screen is buttery smooth to navigate. The phone is definitely bigger and closer to the Note 20 (non Ultra model) in terms of size so that takes some getting used to. Touch could be a bit better. Sometimes you have to touch the screen more than once to activate the screen or to select something. The fingerprint reader is an optical one so it's hit or miss sometimes. I have found that  if I pay attention to where I place my finger, it tends to recognize it more easily.  I just never thought I'd miss the one on the S8 considering the poor placement of the thing.  The stereo speakers can get nice and loud and are better than the single firing ones found on my old phone. Reviewers say that the sound is not as rich as the more premium version of this phone bit if you're coming from a phone that is over 2 years old with only a single speaker, you'll enjoy them. Definitely get a phone cover because the plastic back does scratch and dent easily if you drop it on asphalt as I'm finding out. Haptics are another area where Samsung cut back on this model. The vibration feels close to that of the S7 in a cheap way. To their credit, they have calibrated the vibration motor to react more like when you are moving the cursor around on a text box like that found in a pixel. Just don't expect a solid thump like on the note 10 plus or the S20 models. 6 Gb of ram is plenty now but I may wish I had gotten a phone with 8+ GB in a few years after some OS updates. Only time will tell. Its a crazy time and hard to believe that phone prices have inflated the way they have but if you can get the phone on sale, it's a no brainer and very easy to recommend.","December 28, 2020"
2665,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,Anonymous,5,"I didn't think I'd ever be able to afford a new Galaxy S-series, and if my old Galaxy A-51 hadn't died, I wouldn't have spent the money to buy a new phone...but it completely died after 2 & 1/2 years, and could not be repaired, so I had to. However, at a $399.00 Cyber Monday special, I was able to get this 1-model-back S-21 for what I'd have spent on a comparable A series! And two major things the S series features that the A doesn't is that it supports wireless charging, and smart watch connectivity! It also has a much better camera, and I'm sure I'll find other great features as I go along. The color isn't as ugly as I was afraid it would be- you can actually put a tinted clear case on it and make it a little more pretty, or completely cover it with a solid case. It doesn't come with any extras like Galaxies used to in the past, like a manual, a case, a wall plug, a car plug, or screen protecter- nothing except a shortish cord and a tool to pop out the sim card slot, which is on the side.My service carrier is a government Lifeline company which runs on the T-Mobile network, so I just put my old Sim card in my new phone and it was connected instantly with the same phone number & provider, but I did have to go through all the Google setup, which would have been way easier if my old phone had not been dead, but I got all of my contacts back (though without their photos I'd put with their names), and I lost all the photos from my dead phone; I got most of my apps back, but I did have to reinstall a few, and log into most again in order to use them.Galaxies stopped making the body casings openable a few years ago, so batteries can't be replaced easily, and to try to get them repaired, a tech has to melt the sides of the case open, which turned out really ugly when I tried to get my A-51's charging port replaced (which didn't save my old phone anyway), and it looked like smeared crap after they melted it back together, fyi.This is a very desirable phone, despite the new attempts to make it more throwaway. Hopefully it will last me at least 3 or 4 years- that would be $100. a year...plus interest....it's sad how much things cost so much today.","December 2, 2022"

2667,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,Star,3,"Edit (7/30/2023): This will be the last update I write about the S20 FE, as I plan on getting a new phone in the near future.After 3 years with this phone, I can't say my feelings have changed very much. The only reason I'm writing this is to warn anyone thinking about getting this as a budget phone at some point in the future. The glue holding the back panel has loosened to the point where it is lifting off the phone. There is no bulging battery, as far as I can tell. The cheap glue that they used to put the S20 FE together just isn't holding together anymore. They tout having software/security updates for however many years, but what good is that if the phone falls apart before you get to that point?To anyone reading this in the future: no, this phone isn't worth $499 (the price amazon has it as I'm writing this) new in 2023. The chip is still okay and it has that precious SD slot that phone manufacturers don't want to include nowadays so people buy the expensive, higher storage models. If you really, really want one to use as a budget phone, look for a refurbished one. I've found ones being sold for under $150. Who knows? Maybe the phone refurbishers used better glue to put the phone back together.I haven't decided which phone to get next. All I know is that it won't be a Samsung._________________________________Edit (8/18/2021): I've dropped my rating from 4 stars to 3 stars.It's been a little less than a year, and the issues mentioned below have started to affect daily use in a way that turns this from a great phone to an okay phone not worth your time. Okay, maybe not daily use, per se. But enough that it's starting to effect my initial thoughts on it.The amount of times this phone has turned on in my pocket because of ghost touches is insane. Every time I take it out of my pocket, it's opened a random app and input a few letters on the keyboard. And this is after adjusting the settings to stop these sorts of things. I turned off double tap to turn on (despite wanting that feature) and turned on accidental touch protection (which did absolutely nothing). I even made it so that the phone needed face recognition or a fingerprint to unlock every time I close it. But it just keeps happening. No software update really fixed the screen, as suspected. This is a pure hardware mess up.Here's the cold, honest truth: the screen on the S20 FE is terrible. Worse than my old S7. Worse than even a budget android phone's screen. It's beyond comprehension. The virtual proximity sensor is also worthless. I almost want to give it the classic ""angry Amazon customer 1-star"" review, but I'll refrain. There's still good here with the chip, customizability, and great battery life, but that stuff can only get you so far.Here's my advice: don't bother with this phone. You can get a midrange smartphone for the same (or even a lower) price, with better specs. It's still not the worst thing out there and I'm not tossing it in the trash just yet, but it's definitely the last Samsung product I'll be buying. So disappointing, but I couldn't keep this review a 4-star in good conscience._________________________________I decided on the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE for my smartphone upgrade for a lot of reasons. One, and most obviously, was the price. At $599 ( the price on Amazon when I purchased it), it was an unbeatable deal. Another was the specs: Snapdragon 865 and 6gb of RAM was perfect for my needs. My old Galaxy S7 looked practically primitive when set against the S20 FE. And so, I decided to give a midrange phone a try.At first glance, the S20 FE seemed too good to be true. The screen, while not 4K, still looks great with the 120Hz refresh rate enabled. The rear cameras look incredibly good, nice and crisp. I've done everything from web browsing and gaming to word processing and photography, all with minimal issue. Battery life is solid, but not the best in the market right now. You'll still be able to get a couple of days out of the S20 FE on 120Hz. Also, you can't beat the customizability of Android. With the option to install launchers/widgets plus a wealth of storage (and SD card support), you get a lot of choice with the S20 FE. The size, while much larger than I was used to, still fits in the hand really well. I would recommend getting a case and screen protector for this one though, as I have seen people shatter the screen with a single drop.But, if you've been reading up on the S20 FE at all, then you know that there are problems. First off, the virtual proximity sensor on the phone is spotty at best. Testing it out myself, I had to be right on top of the sensor for it to detect my face. And for phone calls, that means a few more accidental muted/ended calls than usual. The face recognition and fingerprint scanner are also not great. I'd say it works about 85% of the time, but when it doesn't, do you ever feel it. Adding on, the front-facing camera is pretty lackluster. Not bad, but it's not flagship levels by any stretch. You'll need to be in absolutely optimal lighting to get a decent picture out of it. So if you're looking for a phone to take selfies indoors with, I'd look elsewhere.From what I've seen, the standout complaint with the S20 FE is the touchscreen. And yes, my phone (ordered in early November) has the issue too. Pretty horrendous ghosting when testing it in the touchscreen test app. There's undeniably a hardware issue with the S20 FE. There have been updates since the phone released, but none have fixed it entirely; merely a band-aid on a bloody gash. The real question is: does it affect everyday use? Will you notice it every moment you use the S20 FE? The answer to both is no, at least for me. While I'm sure it does affect certain tasks (most notably those that involve fast touches or 3+ fingers), I really haven't noticed it in actual use. Pinching/zooming with your fingers close together will cause the screen to jitter, but that's about all I've seen. If that worries you enough to pass on the S20 FE, I don't blame you.It really is a shame that I can't give the S20 FE a perfect 5 stars, because it does deserve it in some aspects. But with these hardware issues, there's always the worry that time will make them worse. It's a genuine worry, I get that. But even with the problems, the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE is a pretty great phone. It really does feel like a flagship phone, but with a massive price cut and a few downgrades. Only time will tell if the problems the phone has will get worse, but for right now, I'm more than happy with it.","November 18, 2020"
2668,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,June,5,"I tried out the Galaxy (I think?) A71 and hand a lackluster experience before I got this phone. Upgrading was one of the best tech decisions I've ever made.For such a thin and 'delicate' phone, I was worried about how well it would handle everyday life. I never got an indestructible case, just an air-based protection to help keep it from getting dinged up, and this phone has still survived my clumsy hands dropping it all the time. I would recommend a good screen protector, since this phone is All Screen! It makes videos easy to watch and reading text is comfortable thanks to the amount of space I get.The camera is truly stellar. I take a lot of photos of plants and small animals and my photo quality is always very crisp and the color comes through clearly. I've only dabbled with the pro-style lense and the built-in 'photo enhacement' software a little bit, but I think anyone who posts regularly to social media would be able to use those functions well and have some stellar pics come out of it.The battery has suffered, but when I say that I mean it goes about 10hrs on a full charge. Compared to my iPhone 8, which hit the ground running at 12hrs and dropped off dramatically. The original battery was anywhere between 24-36hrs based on my usage, often high because I used my phone for work. Even with the shorter life, the fast-charging mode means I've got my battery juiced in about an hour, maybe two if it's fully dead.The phone can struggle to work as a GPS unit at times, especially when layering GPS, a podcast app, and being plugged in for my car's android auto to work. Typically this only happens to me on long drives, but if I set the phone on an AC vent it can keep chugging away the entire time.","June 28, 2024"
2669,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,M Mullins,3,"Last update, 12/24/22This will be my last update, as I traded this in for a Google Pixel 7. With the price that I bought it at, and the amount for trade in I received from Google on their Black Friday sale, I couldn't pass it up and was basically a wash.This phone never received a monthly security patch. I don't know if that is a Samsung, Amazon, or T-Mobile issue (and maybe it is because I had bought the 256GB storage option??), but it is a major one to me. I don't know if this phone would have even received One UI 5 (aka, Android 13), and I traded it in before I heard it was released in the US for this model. In my few months with this phone, the best thing about it was the price - both amazon's sales price, and Google's trade in value. Take that for what you will if you have a use case similar to mine.Update - 9/15/22I have not received any security updates (August should have been out, by now, September was just released, but my phone is still on the July patch the phone shipped with). I am not sure why this is, and unlike a Pixel phone, there is no way to force/sideload a security patch. In the same timeframe, my S20FE did receive the August patch. I am holding off for now and hoping this is a fluke, but if I don't receive the September update by October, this may indicate an issue with phone itself.Update - 8/9/22After going caseless for a couple of days - both on wifi almost exclusively one day and on 4G LTE another - the case was likely the issue. Both tests resulted in a warm, not heated phone after heavy usage and over 6 hours of screen on time. The Spigen thin hybrid was the same case I had for my S20FE, except this one was not the ""clear"" option. I am not sure if the hard type of plastic on the back did not displace heat well with this phone model or if something in the non-clear cases are made with a material that interferes with RF signals, but that case was returned and a cheap, all-TPU case was purchased. Screen on time has continued to improve from the barely 5 hours before to 6.5-7 with the same usage now. As such, I have added one star to my review. I still encounter ghost touches and I am not sure how much of an improvement the case change has been to signal strength, but this has gone from an underwhelming experience to a solid option for those that can get a good deal on it.Original review below:I have bought and used both an S20 FE (6 RAM/128 ROM) in 2021 and an S21 FE (8 RAM/256 ROM) on Prime Day in 2022. While the S20 FE ended up being almost the perfect phone for the past year, the S21 FE was not worth it, even at Amazon's great price.S21 FE Pros1. Slightly smaller than the S20 FE, and I found it easier to handle - a few millimeters makes a huge difference here.2. Camera was excellent as every other Samsung phone I have owned has been.3. Phone had the July 5th Android update waiting to download when I received the phone in mid July. My S20 FE was about a month behind on monthly patches (probably due to Samsung prioritizing newer phones).4. Solid construction - Like the S20 FE, I have no worries of this getting bent, punctured, or damaged from compression, as I have experienced on some phones. As with just about every other phone I have owned, I have a TPU case on it to prevent fall damage.S21 FE Cons1. Battery life. A little about my settings: after doing all updates, I factory reset the phone to have a ""clean"" install. Downloaded all apps and then turned auto brightness and NFC off, only have bluetooth on when in the car, screen set to 60hz refresh, 5G off, and mostly on fiber-connected WiFi at home. On my S20 FE, this could get me 9 hours on-screen time for one charge easily. The same settings on the S21 FE barely eek out 5 hours with a slightly smaller screen and the same battery size. Not sure if this is a bad android security update (which will prompt an addendum to this review next month) or the phone itself. But underwhelming after 2 weeks of usage.2. Possibly tied to the battery - it seems a lot warmer than my S20 FE ever got when using for long periods of time. Will be using without a case at home to see if that is part of the issue or not.3. Connectivity - I wouldn't say there are rampant issues per se, but it does not seem to have the signal strength when using 4G LTE when out and about. Again, the case may be a factor here, and will be using without for a couple days.4. Ghost touches - have had odd things happen with active on display stopping music, or tapping one area of the screen to open an app and something else entirely launches.At this point, this was not worth the upgrade for my use case, and I probably should have just bought another S20 FE instead. My phones get full usage daily, and it is just a matter of time before the S20 FE's battery starts to take a hit. However, with the charge I get out of the S21 FE, I probably could have stuck with my current S20 FE for quite some time.","July 28, 2022"
2670,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,Shawn,4,"Purchased 12/20, Activated 01/21,Review posting 02/24Pros, cons, random observations,  and everything in between:  quite durable, great life span,  decent camera,  adequate audio quality,  mediocre battery life (at best), consistently corrupted micro sd if over 64gb, tends to run warm-very hot depending on use, has functioned with cracked screen ever since about a week after activation, bloatware sucks as per always (looking at you,  bixby).In the 20ish years preceding my purchase of this device i had had to replace my cell phone about every 9 months (on average). Only one of those dozens of phones survived the first year intact and almost-fully functional.  Enter the S20FE. A week after activation my phone fell off the side of a pool table and cracked the corner of the screen,  expectations plummeted and i figured I'd need yet another new device before the winter's snow had melted.  A few years later and I'm happy to say i was wrong *as i post this review from that same device with the same cracked screen.  I've put this phone through at least the 7th depth of hades: it had been frozen,  drowned, burnt, shot at, stabbed, shocked,  and seen things that shall forevermore remain unspoken of.  And it still works great.I truly can't stand anything bixby, despite having restricted as much a possible it is  still ever-present and annoying.Expandable memory issues and the battery would be my 2 biggest gripes. This phone just loves to corrupt larger capacity memory cards.  Cards of 512gb, 256gb, 200gb, and 128gb have all corrupted & rendered unrecognizable by any other devices i own. 512 was almost immediately,  128 survived a few months but required several reformats performed.Battery life is pathetic. Unplugged maybe an hour now, done little more a couple quick searches & compose this review and already battery is down 15%.  This makes me miss the good old days of being able to swap batteries instead of having to carry around an entire battery pack and leave charge cables hanging from pocket to pocket.","March 2, 2024"

2676,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,James S,3,"UPDATE BELOW- 12/26/2022- UPDATE BELOWIt's a fine phone for a lot of money. $650 is what it normally goes for. I got it for $400 on Amazon- the most I was willing to pay for a phone in 2022.But I'm not very happy with it. It comes with a lot of nonsense apps and just isn't as efficient as the pixel.I'm going to compare this to the Pixel because other than the oneplus nord20 it was the best other option for me and the one I went with.The pixel has a good price of $300 (when it's on sale.) That's the most I'm happy to spend on a phone (obviously I was willing to pay a bit more though.)The pixel is just a much better phone in my opinion- at least for an adult. For me the FE 21 is a candy phone. It's a phone a rich parent would give to a kid (usually- obviously there are different adults and kids), but the Pixel 6a is a useful phone.I have really loved Samsung for a long time. I always bought their phones, but Samsung keeps coming out with more and more expensive phones that are more and more gimmicky.And I swore that I would never spend more than $300 for a phone after spending a lot on Samsung 10e (just wasn't worth the dough). I bought this phone anyway, because, hey, inflation? I wanted to like it since it's Samsung.After trying it out I said, enough is enough, and kept my Pixel.Two things that are better about this phone though:1. the screen has the strongest gorilla glass (victus or whatever.) The pixel 6a uses a really, really old one. That's annoying and not okay.2. This phone is much easier to fix. I've taken apart my S10e and know that Samsung phones are easy to fix. If you want, take a quick look on Youtube or whatever other video website and look for ""Pixel 6a screen repair."" It's not a phone that makes sense to fix :-(. If it breaks you throw it away.But in the end those two reasons weren't enough for me to spend 25% more on a gimmicky candy phone...Have a nice day :-)Update:Oh and the phone doesn't come with a charger. The phone brands claim that it's to reduce ""waste"", but to be honest, I don't know anyone who just throws away an extra phone charger!!! Probably 95% of people keep it as a secondary charger or a charger in the car or something. And there are also the people that for whatever reason just don't have a charger. We don't all inherit chargers at birth!I would take off a star for that, but pretty much all of non-Chinese designed brands are doing ir. That being said, companies like Blu (American owned and designed) or Motorola (Chinese-owned, but Chicago designed) aren't!!!!","December 26, 2022"

After using it for a few months I like its battery life better as it lasts me through the day.The phone is highly customizable thru the ""Good Lock"" app.The volume on the speakerphone has been useful a few times when I have taken while riding my bike with the phone on an armband.I still highly recommend this phone, specially when there's a sale or refurbished one available. More bang for the buck!-------I upgraded from a Galaxy S8. I love the bigger screen size. I miss the physical thumbprint on my old phone, but the on-screen one on the S21FE is very responsive. After reading about all the issues people have had with the Pixel 6, I was wary. This phone exceeded my expectations. It is fast and the screen size is just right. For my older eyes I can read well, and will just fit in my back pocket [inside of a Spigen case].The sound is good as I place calls on speakerphone or listen podcasts while I mull around the kitchen.The battery is average, it is great that it can be charged wirelessly since having it in my jacket pocket while I cycle I get condensation and would not be able to charge it with a cable until it fully dries.I set my refresh screen to 60Mhz to save some battery and the scrolling is still smooth.To nitpick, it would be nice to have a SD card slot when I want to shoot a lot of pics or bring extra lectures (videos) to watch at my leisure.The modem has been great and I have been getting speeds of 300Gbps in Chicago (Metro by T-Mobile)I am very happy with this phone and think the icing on the cake was that it will get 4 android versions.

2681,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,Felice jamaica,5,"I had my previous phone, a Huawei Mate 9  for 3 years (ordered from Amazon), and I felt it was time for an upgrade. After researching and narrowing my decision down to the Google Pixel 5 and the Samsung S20 FE 5G, I chose the S20 FE 5G. For me, it came down to being able to expand the memory and I prefer to have that option. So far, everything works great. I love the pastel color choices! Cloud lavender looks pretty and so does the Cloud Orange, but I had to go with my favorite color, Cloud Mint.The fingerprint reader is accurate and fast. When unlocking the phone, the bright light is a little blinding, especially if unlocking the phone in the dark. Face recognition works great and it unlocks well with my eyeglasses on too.For the battery life, it seems that it doesn't last long compared to my previous phone. With the S20 FE 5G, I noticed with my normal use (watching YouTube videos, using social media, surfing the internet, etc.), I would have to charge it after a day, but with the Mate 9, I was able to use it for almost 2 days before having to charge it.I love the quality of the rear/front camera. The rear camera focuses well and the photos appear brighter/sharper which I like. The front camera is fixed and doesn't allow for autofocus when tapping on the screen, which I'm bummed out about. I hope this is something that will be fixed. The super steady mode is awesome!Included in the box: phone, charging adapter, charging cable, paperwork, and the sim tray eject tool. I do wish the charging cable was a bit longer and I wish it came with earphones, but it's not a big deal. I'll be buying a usb-c to 3.5mm headphone adapter. I do have Bluetooth earbuds, but I prefer connecting directly for better sound.When I received my package and I opened it up, it came with ZERO packaging, which I was unhappy about. You would think it would come with some protection with bubble wrap or air pillows to avoid the phone from getting tossed around in the box. Amazon, please make sure the package is secured well so the product we are paying $$$ for arrives safely.","January 25, 2021"

That lasted only 2 years and then moved so slow and functioned so poorly I knew I had to research and move into the big leagues.  I am so thrilled with every aspect of this phone.  Its screen is vibrant and colorful.  Its video quality is superb and scrolling around and going between apps it moves like lightning.  I am extremely impressed with the camera and video quality as well.  Some complain about the selfie camera.  At first I was not happy but did my research on how to use all its features and now I am beyond thrilled.  Everything here far surpasses all my expectations.  Phone call quality is excellent and the audio from the speakers also shines.  Bluetooth connectivity is a breeze and music and audio books sound excellent.  This is all enough for me to love this phone but add in the battery life and it becomes a true winner.  With excessive use I get at least a full day out of it.  I never got half a day with my Motorola.  I have installed a 128 gb sd card for quality amount of storage.  This phone never falters and performs at the highest level all the time.

2684,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,Paul,5,"Just ordered my phone it came super quick at a discount from Amazon. For $635 , the phone is quick the cameras look really cool on the back but I'm not a fan of how clear they look the picture is fuzzy and is always halfway zoomed in. Coming from lg Google phone from 2017 the samsung ui and ecosystem is mediocre at best, it feels really slippery and unfufilling like every app you open is opened on accident like you just slipped into this app. Counter intuitive power off process(its not the same as to power on wtf ). Bixby sucks to say the least, a lot of wireless half baked features that are impractical. But the phone seems reliable enough, I know how to maximize battery life like first changing the wallpaper to a black and white version, limiting 5g/network(I like how you can easily enable 5g if needed, but who really needs that much power?), and of course keeping no apps running in the background, and putting the phone on do not disturb mode so it doesn't vibrate itself to oblivion, which is weird because the phone forces a lot of notifications even after you turn them off or minimize them. I expected a little cleaner software, honestly would have preferred a brand new s9+, but I couldn't find anything that wasn't refurbished. I turned the 120 Hz refresh rate off and boom the battery is lasting a couple days on the regular love 4500 MA battery. I like the glasstic back, but be warned there is a slippery feel to it so go to eBay and grab a quick 10 buck case to be safe. Overall I'm happy with the device. The expandable storage is very nice and I bought another 128 gigs for 30 bucks at target so I have all the memory I need and more! Just wish I could switch to the Google version of software but keep the Samsung hardware, because those pixels are looking weak! Watching the iphone 12 commercial made me shrug and grateful I had this phone, the price, the value, and the vibe of my mint cloud samsung 20 fe is one that is pretty much unmatched! The box is the phone and charger, the speakers sound is a little above average. The fingerprint reader is solid and practical. Totally worth it.","October 15, 2020"

I have taken some really great photos with this and gotten so many colors/details. Also love the features and the modes.- 5G phone (happen to live in an area where I get some of this lol)CONS- battery at first (I had to switch to 60 hz display and now I get basically a full day/8-10 hrs)- no headphone jack- sometimes the pull out side draws are hard to pull out with touch- adaptive brightness didn't work well/anytime I'm outside I have to turn it up quite a bit- the photos and screenshots all save to the same place, so I have to sort through to get to my pictures sometimes and selectively import photos to google (serious hassle, but that's just how Samsung has it set up)OTHER- honestly, from the moment I bought it, I forgot how long I had it and had zero regrets after purchase. VERY HAPPY and will definitely buy another samsung (pending reviews) when I want to upgrade phones again . . .  though I have a feeling this one will last a while.- Would definitely still recommend this phone! :)Update 1/6/2023: Love the fun and works just as good as when I bought it nearly a year ago (Feb). 🙂","August 3, 2022"

I was upgrading from a Samsung S10e with a battery that was starting to get really low on charged time and some apps were getting glitchy and kept crashing.Since this was on sale, I decided it was time to upgrade on a four and half year old phone. Saved $180 on Prime Day. Much cheaper than if I bought it from my service provider. I can only compare it to my previous phones but this is a very noticeable improvement in quality and operation.It works well, quicker and a little smoother operating than the S10e. In switching sim card to this phone, there were no glitches for the service provider, Consumer Cellular. I play a lot of games. and the apps are running without crashing anymore and it works well. Battery is solid not great, but a definite upgrade from my previous Samsung. Display is sharper and a bigger screen which means a better viewing experience for my old eyes. Setting up the fingerprint security has improved greatly since I last bought. Much quicker and easier.

2688,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,John R Yeh,4,"Overall I like the phone. It's definitely missing basic features like a headphone jack, that I enjoyed on my Samsung Galaxy A52.That being said, the thing with Samsung phones is that the battery could be twice this size and it'll only last as long as the average time of other brands. Samsung has horrendous battery managent because they force you to always run their bloatware. You can't uninstall them and some you can't remove notifications or stop from running.In general I really like the camera and the screen. You can't get the specs that this phone has for the sale price. It does have smaller cameras but it's about the software and the sensors being used here. I can have a phone with 100+ megapixels and still lack the details that this phone provides. It's why I turned down similar Motorola, Nokia, TCL and other branded phones.I also wanted dust resistance which this phone is good at. Truthfully, LG phones blew these Samsung phones out of the water. But hype and brand popularity kept Samsung chugging along while real competition got removed. So now I'm stuck using this phone until another company comes along. But it is a good phone! So no worries there. You just won't have good battery life. Also Samsung phones are notoriously slow chargers, my 5yr old phone charges faster than this thing. I'm talking about older than 2010 speeds. Definitely buy a fast charger! It's needed just to get average speeds.","March 23, 2022"
2689,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,M Mullins,4,"This is a beautiful, capable, reasonable smartphone, but the particular one I received would not charge on my third-party wireless charger, either with or without the Samsung silicone case. I ordered a 15 W Samsung wireless charging stand, but that failed in the same manner, Attempts to get help from Samsung's support organization resulted in an erroneous conclusion that the 15W charger did not support the S20 series of phones, but the newer 9W version did, so I ordered the 9W charger...and got the same results. I concluded that the problem had to be with the QI system within the phone, and initiated a return procedure to Amazon, intending to request a simple 'return and replace with identical item', but that option was not available for the phone. Amazon indicated that to speed up the process, I should chat with their specialists before simply returning the phone for credit. After a one-hour 'chat' with Amazon technical help, who finally transferred me to Samsung technical help, who spent another hour before they concluded that I should take the phone to a Samsung-approved service center, which is 2.5 hours away, with no assurance that they could resolve the problem; even less probability they could resolve the problem in the same day...I processed the standard return-to-Amazon-for credit application. Then with a confirmation that the return was approved, I simply ordered another (identical) phone. On it's arrival, I quickly transferred all app, data, etc from the old phone to the new phone, swapped the SIM carrier (containing the SIM card and the external memory card). The new phone charges easily and quickly on both Samsung wireless chargers, even with the Samsung cover on the phone. Using the straight-forward Amazon process is simple and efficient, but when people get involved, the efficiency is subject to total loss, simplicity is gone, and patience becomes a victim.","January 29, 2021"
2690,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,Shawn,5,"This SAMSUNG Galaxy S20 FE 5G was not my first choice, but since LG has stopped manufacturing phones, it was my second choice.  Replacing my LG Style 6, which measures over 7"", this Samsung phone is smaller but still comfortable to use in most regards.  Most phones I and my wife have had these past several years have their fingerprint reader on the back of the phone, which is much easier to use and more comfortable.  The Samsung S20 FE has a fingerprint reader embedded on the bottom of the screen, which is a bit awkward to use.  But the fingerprint reader is fairly accurate providing you follow the directions and scan multiple areas of your fingertip.  The screen is vibrant with deep colors & good contrast.  Since my phone is primarly a phone that I occasionally use for texting, I haven't used the camera yet nor do I use all of the features associated with video.  I have my dozen or so apps that I use frequently, and they all work well on this phone.  There isn't much bloatware installed by Samsung; most of it is installed by Google.  I do seem to get a bit better connection with this phone.Setup was a breeze.  I use ConsumerCellular as my carrier, and all I had to do was move my SIM and microSD cards from the old phone to this new phone, and everything was automated after that!  I used the SmartSwitch app to transfer from the LG phone to the Samsung phone, and that went smoothly, easily and without issue.","March 15, 2022"

2692,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,Dr Ken,5,"The Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G phone is easy to set up and outperforms my Galaxy S8+ in all regards. For those of you with Spectrum Mobile service, 'in my experience,' the S21 FE phone works without issue. HOWEVER, do not expect meaningful support from Spectrum. The Spectrum Compatibility Web App reports the S21 FE is incompatible with their network. However, it also reports incompatibility for my wife's Galaxy S21 Ultra and my old S8+, both of which perform well on the Spectrum network. Chatting with customer service yielded the same result: incompatible. However, after switching the SIM card from my S8+ to the S21 FE, about fifteen minutes later, I received an automated email from Spectrum stating I would be enjoying their 5G service within an hour. Less than twenty minutes later, the network recognized my phone's IMEI number and connected it to the network. DISCLAIMER: The foregoing is for informational purposes. It is based solely on my experience. Your experience may vary. I hope this helps. Good luck!","August 25, 2023"
2693,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,Savannah Block,3,"Update)After running the diagnosis, the local service center told me it was because the sim was not connecting to the network, which could be either due to faulty sim card, carrier software, or issue within the phone itself. I contacted my carrier and tries swapping the sim card in another phone, which shows that the sim was working fine. So I contacted samsung customer service again, they told me to send the phone over to repair it. After about a week, I have received the phone. The service statement says cause of problem was WPC FAILURE, and solution was S/W UPDATED. I got my phone back after a week, the software was updated and the phone was working fine so far. Hopefully there wont be any more issues in the near future.---------Purchased the S21fe early July this year, been having so much issue since purchased. I was unable to receive phone calls for over a month. Tried so many things to fix the issues. One day, I was able to receive phone calls after resetting everything, and thought the problem was finally resolved... I was wrong. Another issue popped up; the audio quality during phone call became so bad, the other side couldn't understand a single word I said. Then again, after the help from Samsung customer service, I was able to resolve that issue. While I thought everything was good.... I couldn't receive the phone call again!!! Have booked an appointment with a local service center, hopefully they can fix it. Aside from that, my phone still hasn't received the August security patch, it has been one month since the patch released.  It's been so frustrating trying to deal with the issue and having to worry about missing important calls. (Also can't return it, because I thought a software update would fix the problem and has been waiting and waiting, and 30 days has passed, issue still there)","September 16, 2022"
2694,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,Brock,4,"I purchased a Samsung S21 to replace my Samsung S10 Lite that the screen cracked on and was starting to have a few technical glitches.  After using the new S21 for a few days I can almost live with my old glitches and cracked screen.  For a brand new phone this battery drains QUICKLY.  I am already going to be ordering another fast charging port so that I can get through the day at work AND the evening before charging it fully at night.  Another feature that isn't working is the face recognition.  That isn't a deal breaker for me since I am content using the fingerprint option, but something I've noticed just the same and wanted to mention in case you relied on it.I have had LOTS of Samsung phones and am always happy with them, but this one misses the mark a bit for me mainly due to battery life.  Since purchasing I have done a few tweaks that were mentioned like going to dark mode and restarting more to make sure I am rebooting once in awhile (which is something I rarely had to do on my S10).  I am hoping that makes a difference.","July 22, 2022"
2695,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,Ryan Chen,4,"Bought the 256GB version when it was on sale for $599 on Amazon which was a very good buy.Overall it's a decent flagship phone, some may say lower tier flagship which I could understand. Performance is alright but it's Android so you will occasionally get app freezing every now and again. Camera is good (not great) but pixel 6 is better. I love the many many features that Samsung that this device comes with such as Bixby routines (game changer), Samsung Dex, secure folder, good lock, RAM Plus, a customizable always on display, edge panels, link to windows for synchronization with a windows computer, smart widgets (stacking multiple interactive widgets together that can rotate) video call effects with apps such as duo as duo, WhatsApp, MS Teams, zoom. The screen recorder actually captures the audio from a zoom or Google meet etc. Battery life is good enough once you don't use 120hz all the time (Bixby routine can help with that).This phone will get 4 years of OS updates and 5 years of security updates so that's really great for longevity.Wouldn't recommend it for $699 but if you see it on sale for much less (you certainly will on Amazon) then go for it","May 6, 2022"
2696,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,Sara,4,"I've been an iPhone user for many years but the cost of purchasing one outside of a device agreement with a carrier is astronomical. Moving to an Android phone was a bit of a culture shock and took some time to get used to. However now that I've been using it for a few months, I'm pretty happy with it. The battery life is pretty good; I get a full day on one charge although I don't play a lot of graphic heavy games, just mainly social media and online browsing, emails etc. I may eventually go back to Apple but I like that I could purchase a brand new phone at a reasonable price and not be locked into a device agreement for three years or so.

2697,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,Tevii,4,"Just received the S20 FE today.  Im switching over from the original Pixel XL. Wasnt thrilled enough with the Pixel 5 and 4a 5G lineup/availability. So I thought I would give this one a shot.  Overall its been a good first day with the phone.I popped in my Verizon sim card and after setup (see below) I immediately had cell service and 4G connectivity. No problems there.Setup was kinda a pain switching from a Google phone. I had my old phone backing up to Google drive. The setup process didnt quite help make a full transfer. It pulled in my contacts and app data, but didnt reinstall my play store apps automatically or transfer my SMS/call history. What I ended up doing was using the Samsung Smart Switch app. I installed it on my old/new device and it transferred every thing.  Contacts, SMS/call history, app data, photos, videos, etc. It even started automatically installing my missing apps. That was nice.Performance wise the phone feels pretty snappy and has a nice display.  I havent had a chance to play with the camera yet. Today was just 'get the phone up and running"" day.My biggest issue is not with the phone itself but with the the original listing on Amazon when I purchased the phone a few days back. It said the phone had 8GB of RAM.  That was a selling point for me.  When I booted up the phone I check the settings and it says 6GB. I came back into this phones listing in Amazon and wouldnt you know, now it says the phone has 6GB of RAM. Hmmm... That kinda ticked me off. But not the phones fault.","October 4, 2020"
2698,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,Kimberly M,3,The phone does work as a smart phone. When I can get it to take pictures in focus they are nice but it is hard to tell until after if I am not specifically looking at the focus.Auto focus:The auto focus is painfully slow. Sometimes it just works but most times it works after a solid 1-3 seconds. Sometimes it takes >5s which just leaves me wondering what it is doing that could take this long.A perfect example is with normal lens everything in view of the camera is >20' away and it is just stuck out of focus for 3 seconds. Then the focus finally starts to wander after another 1-2 seconds it focuses.This seems to affect both the normal and zoom lense. I don't use the wide angle much but I would guess it has the same problem.The final result of this is if I'm in a hurry and not paying attention to the focus 1/4 to 1/3 of my pictures are out of focusFinger Print Sensor:It works okay most of the time. When in a dark environment it is blindingly bright if you don't cover the entire sensor before the back light turns on at ~100% brightness.Also sometimes the phone unlocks at 100% brightness too which just seems like sloppy programming that doesn't turn down the rest of the screen brightness before it displays it. It seems like it realizes it is dark after the phone has been unlocked for a 1/10 of a second.Overall it makes unlocking my phone in the dark painful at best. It feels like it is wrong more times than it is right so I close my eyes before I try unlocking it.Using the Camera kills other apps:I run and keep track of it on my phone. If I take some pictures while running more often than not the camera app will silently kill all apps running on the phone. So when I get done I find that my phone stopped recording when I took some pictures. There doesn't seem to be a way to stop the camera from killing everything. In testing I can get runs that are 39 seconds long by taking pictures shortly after starting the run.Note: Moved to this phone from the S9,"December 22, 2020"
2699,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,M Mullins,5,"I have not had this phone for long; maybe a few months in with this device. The battery life is impeccable for me! I am a young person. That being said, I am on my phone very often. I have watched hours of movies, YouTube videos, and shows. I am not much of a tech nerd but I can say that compared to my old phone the battery lasts more than all day, after countless hours using it.I originally bought this type of phone because I hoped that it would not be obsolete in two years like my old LG K10. I also bought this phone for it's DeX feature. You can basically turn your phone into a computer desktop if you have a projector or desktop computer/laptop using an HDMI cord to type-C. This is an awesome device! The screen is very colorful and watching videos on it is perfect!I must say that this phones fingerprint reader is horrendous. It has only read my fingerprint about 62% of the time. I really do not care about it, because my old phone never even had that feature. I have not tried the face recognition feature yet.Something that I do not like is the back camera sticks out from the phone a little. I would recommend you get a phone case right away, or at least get camera and screen protectors ASAP. If you drop your phone one good time without a case and protectors, your whole phone would probably malfunction. The cameras I think would shatter internally.","August 3, 2021"
2700,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,Shawn,5,"I'm writing this review on this phone. I bought this after my S9 began to really slow down and stop working. This phone is, hands down, amazing for the price. I've only used my portable charger once since buying this phone and that was when I first got it and the phone was at around 50%. I was so used to my old phone dying I didn't realize the battery life on this one was great. I can leave my house at 9am at 80%, use Bluetooth and play around on it almost all day, use snapchat and text and watch videos on it, and come home by 9pm to 20% and it can still go for another hour.I've used this phone up to 5% with no real issues and for someone who's out the house for hours at a time, this is great news.The fingerprint reader is, in my opinion, better than the S9 and in a better place. The facial recognition is also great. And the ability to transfer all my data AND keep my pages in the exact same layout was, no doubt, AMAZING!The only MINOR complaint I have is the lack of a microsd slot. I personally don't need it much but some might and I could see how that'll be an issue.","April 6, 2022"
2701,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,Sattirdae,4,"Needed a new phone.  First, I bought the Galaxy S22+.  It got really hot and the battery drained so quickly.  Plus, the outrageous price.  So, I returned it.  Look around, read reviews, and I found this S21 FE 5G with 8gb Ram and 256gb memory.  Got it on a good deal on Amazon Prime Day  I love this phone.  Yes, it's an older model, with older Snapdragon 888 processor, and plastic back.  But with Snapdragon 888, the phone does not get hot, and the battery life last me more than a day.  And I use Spigen Rugged Armor case to keep the phone safe.  Therefore, whether it has a glass back or plastic back means nothing to me.  And it was half the price of the S22+.  This is a great alternative to the S22 series.  The only reason I do not give it a 5 stars is it does not have an expanded memory slot, which I deemed an essential android signature.","August 8, 2022"

All the better phones I looked at could stream directly to my Oticon More I hearing aids.The face ID works as well as I expected as long as there is sufficient light. Why the phone doesn't produce more light when it needs it is a curiosity to me.Like other phones I've had the fingerprint reader seems to require me to change how I apply my finger to the reader as time goes by.The battery life is good and I only need to charge during the day if I am doing g a lot of Bluetooth broadcasting to my hearing aids.Thy biggest annoyance at this point is I usually have to re-pair my hearing aids at least once a day.","July 21, 2022"

2707,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,Placeholder,5,"To give some context, I'm coming from a Galaxy S7.FYI, I read some of the bad reviews. Most are widely inaccurate.Pros- Easy setup: I'm on Verizon and all I had to do was swap the sim card. I didn't have to take the phone to store, I didn't have to log in and change settings, etc.- The 120hz OLED screen is game changing (for me). I'm gamer and I could immediately notice how fast and responsive the panel is. Colors are vibrant and blacks are inky inky black.- Processor is light years ahead of S7. It's also running the 20 series flagship processor.- Camera is amazing.  3x zoom and wide lens. Yesss please.- I love the colors. I got the Orange.- Samsung's OneUI is a huge improvement. Very intuitive and very powerful. I've been setting up advanced Bixby routines. I honestly never thought i would use Bixby but I'm a believer now.- Larger screen and battery than the S20- Very fast and responsive finger print scanner- Dual sim cards and up to 1TB of additional storage if you buy a micro sd card. I'm looking at you APPLE. Although Samsung will be removing the sd card storage slot for S21's for some reason.- Comes with a charger. APPLE!Cons- Face recognition is too slow for my liking. The finger print reader is more than adequate.- No 3mm headphone jack- Out of the box charger is not the best. You get a 15 watt charger even though this phone can handle 25 watts.In summary, if you can get this phone for 550 to 600 bucks... BUY IT.","January 12, 2021"

I am able to get 5G where available and it took me awhile to become familiar with Samsung apps but now I really like using Samsung apps instead of Google apps.But I'm amazed of how hard it is to learn a different ecosystem.

Samsung is going to give competition to the to the likes of Amazon, Google and Microsoft.Each phone company wants you to use their apps and it took me a month or two to get used to this because at first I thought they're forcing me to use their apps.

Sony, pixel 5, and s21 ultra.Pixel 5 freezes randomly at times and Bluetooth issues, Sony was just not very good and drained battery life like crazy. I tried giving the Sony two chances because the camera features are nice but it wasn't enough enough to cover the flaws. The s21 ultra was fantastic, but I couldn't justify the price tag. This phone however was the best. 120hz screen makes it feel premium, but hardware is not slow to where to muddied the user experience. The screen is bright, and it's not 4k but you can't tell on a all device. The battery life also lasts so long because the resolution is not high. Samsung's interface is quite nice and it certainly makes using an android phone extremely enjoyable because it doesn't feel cheap like the Sony did. I will never use an iPhone again, and it was hard for me to find a great alternative. I was hesitant on getting a Samsung too because I was in love with Google products up until the pixel 5. However I can say I'm a big fan of Samsung and their phones and will probably keep using their phones given the user experience was unrivaled by any other Android phone.

The fingerprint reader is a double edged sword for me. Coming from a note 8, the position of the reader is an upgrade (the reader on the note is on the rear of the phone) but its reliability is iffy. Sometimes itll recognize immediately and other times it takes it a while to recognize it. This is a common issue documented elsewhere as well but not a deal breaker. The biggest issue for me is the camera. While the camera is better than the note 8s on paper, in the real world im having issues with it. The focus is terrible, especially while using flash.

Occasionally it will even refuse to read so many times in a row I have to draw my pattern to unlock.Final problem: when I'm taking pictures with it, sometimes the camera app will ""freeze"" for 10-15 seconds at a time. It will seem like it's working, but just won't take a picture, no matter how many times I jam that take-a-picture button on the screen.

Battery, if the phone starts at 100%, by the end of the day it won't be fully dead (even if you have the 120hz screen, which is like spreading butter on bread, you won't go back to 60hz after using the 120hz).Once you get to play with the phone itself, you will notice this cellphone can compete or even win its sisters like the s20 or the s20 plus (heck it can probably bit the iphone11 just with its extra perks)For the price you get, you won't get rip off. It's nice that you can this phone at an reasonable price and not spend 1k on a phone that can do the same thing.Highly recommend if you want a good Phone and for a great price!!!","April 13, 2021"
2719,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,M Mullins,5,"After purchasing refurbished phones from two different places that were not unlocked as advertised, I finally caved and spent a little more to buy this factory unlocked phone. That being said, the phone is pristine condition and set up with my Mint Mobile SIM with no issues at all. I was able to set it up and be making calls within 5 minutes. So far everything is working smoothly and it seems to hold a charge really well! The screen display is crystal clear and flawless. The delivery time was super fast as well.  Overall, I am impressed and would buy from this seller again.","September 6, 2023"
2720,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,Shawn,3,"Ultimately, the S21 FE is a great phone.Before buying the phone, I was pretty skeptical especially after binging hundreds of reviews from the mobile community and YouTube. The reason why I decided to buy it however though is for 3 reasons; 1. Value for money; 2. Wanting to stay within the Samsung ecosystem and 3. The software support lifetime.For all reasons above and you may have read before, if you are wondering...the s21 fe DOES deliver!However, there is one (and a half) nitpick which influenced my 3/5 rating.1. (The half) - The battery life, though great seems a bit beneath the standard for modern smartphones, this can be attributed to the absence of an adaptive refresh rate on the display (so basically it's either ALL IN or 50% IN with your display)2. (The actual stuff) - The phone is advertised to be dual sim, heck even the model number indicates ""DS"" meaning ""Dual SIM"" and while the phone does have 2 SIM trays to back this up. The sad thing is, only ONE works at a time. The Quick Start Guide indicates that ""a software upgrade will be required..."" however so far I'm THREE (3) updates in and still no Dual SIM functionality. This will be pretty devastating to a lot of persons who travel internationally, however its even worse that Samsung is seemingly misleading its consumers with features but no functionality.","June 20, 2022"
2721,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,Lizlie Smythers,4,"Overall, I like the phone.  It's fast, stable, and feature packed.  I replaced an older LG G8 and this is my first Samsung phone since the original Galaxy (which I was horrible for me).  I bought this because it supports an SD Card and was otherwise a relatively inexpensive, yet full featured phone.If I have one notable complaint, it's how the camera physically protrudes from the phone.  Not much, but it prevents it from sitting flat on a surface (unless I have it in a case).  This might be necessary for the camera's features and the ""thinness"" of the phone, but it makes me concerned about scratching the camera glass.  While there are glass screen protectors for the camera glass, they don't stay on well unless appropriately protected in a case.Overall very good, but I don't like how the phone makes me concerned about damaging the camera area and doesn't otherwise sit flat outside of a case.","November 20, 2021"

You will only get the cable (C to C) and adapter is not included. Some cables (USB to C) do not work properly so I ended up buying the Samsung adapter C to C. Android Auto DOES NOT WORK on this phone, I had to buy an adapter for the car (usb to C) cables used with other phones didn't work. Adapter didn't recognize the Android Auto app either (I bought Samsung original cables), I have done everything but it just don't work on this phone. I have read that all Samsung S21 have reported the same issue. This is frustrating, Android Auto works fine with Pixel 6 and Xiaomi, so I'm considering changing the phone.","June 18, 2022"

This is exactly why I refuse to buy Hard drives from these people.I bought an 2 extremely expensive FPGA dev boards just to have 1 that I was required to sign for but the other one was where the Amazon box was placed inside a USPS box then sent through regular mail.GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER PEOPLE.There is no reason to connect your Alexa to a dish washer where you focus your energy yet you can't even send high end electronics through the mail without controversy.I have no doubt this review will make it through but hopefully someone will read it and say...hey...Maybe we should look at this.,"December 11, 2020"

I was an early adapter but not a nerd. I choose Samsung over other manufacturers and have been very satisfied. iphone users always seem ready to put the Android down but I find the Samsung a much better price point. Each one seems to get a little better. Especially the camera optics. No exception with this one. My wife is now using my previous A50 model and is very satisfied.

2727,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,Shopping Queen,4,"Bought this White FE 25th March 2022 but started using some time in May and it took 3 months of using to realize that it is ACTUALLY DUAL SIM!!!  All along I thought that the sim tray having SIM1 and SIM2 on the flip side was a generic design.  It is odd because nothing on Amazon says dual sim but now checking GSM arena, it does indeed say dual sim stand-by.The only draw back for me is the caller ID. It only shows the contact is the number is stored EXACTLY as it shows if the contact calls you! Very frustrating seeing contacts numbers I have stored display as a plain NOT saved first time caller.","August 16, 2022"
2728,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,S Switzer,4,"The two reviews below are from the first two times I attempted to purchase and use this phone. Third time was the charm. The Bluetooth works fine, and I'm loving this phone!----------------The phone is very attractive, the sound quality is good, and the screen is large and the picture clear. But I had nothing but trouble trying to get my Bluetooth devices to hook up with it. After trying unsuccessfully to find a fix (both from Samsung and my auto manufacturer), and having to reboot by Fitbit multiple times today, I got so aggravated that I returned it (August 2020)I purchased this phone a second time (April 2021), hoping Samsung would have fixed the Bluetooth issues in the meantime. They have not. Again, I tried multiple solutions from multiple sources, from user groups to the manufacturer. But really, at these prices, should I have to do research to make it do something it's supposed to do anyway? I really wanted to love this phone, but it is useless to me unless the Bluetooth works with my car.","October 27, 2020"

Do not expect this phone to last for over a day evsn if you're just watching YouTube on it.

2732,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,Kathleen Purcell,1,"AT&T shut off both of my numbers for the Ulefone Note 9P. That is a great phone with working Dual Sims, looong battery life, and expanded memory. The didn't tell me they were shutting off my device they just did it. After a back and forth, I learned the Ulefone company is not partnered with AT&T, so they were rejecting their unlocked devices in the U.S. I went to the AT&T store, and I was told the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G would work with dual Sims on the AT&T network. They didn't  have any on stock other than the display that features two sim slots. I checked Samsung  online and it also advertised  the dual sim US functionality.  Finally, I came to Amazon and I purchased it after verifying the dual physical sims. It cost me $634 with tax. My Ulefone that worked great cost $120-$130 also on Amazon. I was willing to pay 5 times more for a slightly less powerful phone because of AT&T's stance on non partner unlocked phones and Samsung and AT&T's verifying  this was a Dual sim capable  product. After receiving it, I used AT&T's social media support to re-activate my line via a phone call. They said they didn't do the dual sim support and ended the call. After spending a couple hours transferring  everything  - apps, passwords,  pics, etc. - I finally reached Samsung chat support. After I submitted picture evidence  that it has 2 sim slots, Samsung came clean. They don't release the software for dual sims in the U.S. (because carriers don't want it I've learned), BUT they said that they will release the feature update ""soon."" When is soon? ""Soon.""If Samsung and the distributor advertisements here on Amazon wouldn't have misrepresented this phone, i wouldn't have purchased it. They want me to send back a device for a refund, now, that has all my personal and business info loaded on it with no option for me to have a working  device.Let this be a warning  for those who don't read sub threads of sub threads about tech, and just believe the manufacturer (Samsung), carrier (AT&T), and distributor (Amazon) won't openly misrepresent and lie to rob you.The battery on this is relatively weak, the memory  is comparatively weak, and IT'S  NOT DUAL SIM  FUNCTIONAL.","May 13, 2022"

2737,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,Jacob E,1,"Bought two from Amazon with protection plans and new cases for elderly parents, both phones went completely black in first few months. Thank goodness we got the protection plan, or so we thought. No serial or ID information was able to be obtained from the phone since it was dead, it was a nightmare completing the form because it times out if not completed in time, like a game show or something.  After 2 days of helping parents complete the form from a long distance away, yes they had to complete the forms from our instructions over a phone call, it finally was accepted and we got the phone replaced (another refurb) in weeks..on the first phone. Now that it has happened again they are questioning an 81 year old for scamming and fraud! Keep in mind you have to actually send the old phone back before they send your replacement, I guess they just feel compelled to give him such a hard time that he wants to give up? Not sure why they can't just confirm the phone is garbage when they receive it and respond accordingly.

I'm kinda hard on my phone battery,  and this one could take the abuse. Fairly quick charging off a wall jack or portable battery with plenty of active use time.

It has nothing to do with my location, as I work from home and I'm usually sitting in the same place in my home. I've never had this issue with any other phones.My online experience with this phone is terrible. It is very slow to load and respond. Same is true with many apps on my phone.The phone regularly freezes and I am unable to scroll or migrate away from the view to another open window. I also have often experienced the phone just shutting down an app while I am using it. I don't have a lot of extra apps on my phone and stick to the basic apps for bank, credit cards, Amazon and rideshare apps, nothing unusual.Fingerprint reader works for a while, then doesn't. I am only able to fix it by deleting my recognized prints and starting over.I regularly restart the phone trying to improve the performance. I am not high-tech by any stretch and my use of the phone is pretty basic.

After the last two, my Galaxy watch will disconnect from my phone when I walk to another room. Very frustrating. I'm seriously considering getting a new phone. I love Galaxy phones.

2743,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,Love Paris,2,"The phone works well as a phone, past the 5G switching not being completely worked out, but that is a carrier issue.  I am a Sprint customer and because of the merger and network confusion my phone thinks a 5/5 Sprint 4G LTE signal is  roaming and tried to grab the 1 bar TMobile signal..Now for the showstopper.  The touch hardware is complete and utter trash.  The October firmware update helped a bit.  The sensor array is in a horizontal/Vertical grid.  If you touch three points on the screen and slide any of those fingers past the same grid line as another finger, it drops the moving touch . 4 out of 10 times, and strobes like a series of taps the other 6. The strobing lasts for 1/10 second or so.  I used developer mode to show touches and can watch the touch just disappear.  Now if I place two fingers on each side of the screen so they're both on the same horizontal plane, and then move a third finger between them it drops touch and then strobes every single time.This really looks like an issue from the early days when companies were struggling to get multi finger gestures to reliably work.  Perhaps Samsung used a design made in 2006-2008 to maximize profits. Shameful.I pre-ordered this phone. I have never preordered any piece of hardware. I did it because ""Samsung knows howmto make a phone. That is one thing they get right, unless it explodes..."".  Well, apparently Samsung forgot how to make a touchscreen screen.... Yes, Samsung.  A screen.  That's your thing... You make screens. You screwed that up like a first time manufacturer.  And then you decided to sell it anyway. You even mentioned ""Games"" in your advertising.This is my third Galaxy S10 FE with this same issue.  Initial phone was Sprint branded (returned), second was unlocked (waited two weeks for more information and spent over an hour on the phone with Samsung, the Requested replacement), replacement phone has same exact issue.  Failing 3/3 of the time... That looks like 1... Yup.  100% failure rate. This is after the October firmware update that was supposed to fix the touch bugs.","November 1, 2020"

When I saw this s20 FE was released with all the bells and whistles of the $1000 phone and for a more reasonable price, I had to go for it. The phone came undamaged, no scratches or smudges or anything. The battery life is great. I have a lot of screen time throughout the day, and by the time I go to bed at night I still have within the 70% range of battery left. The cameras are cool, but I haven't had a chance to really mess with the features all that much yet. I love that it works with my wireless charger. The display features are awesome.

One area of the screenlooked a little off to me but I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me and pushed through. I noticed the bend( which slightly warped part of the screen) about a week in but ignored it because it could only be seen under certain conditions and because i believed it to be harmless. However within a few weeks I noticed that the touch detection when I'm typing often messes up, especially when I'm using swipe. Not only that but after applying a screen protector the issue becomes very obvious as it's never able to properly adhere to the warped area of the screen. I contacted Amazon about the problem and was told there was nothing that could be done because my complaint  was outside their ""satisfactory window"". Now I'm left with a device with a factory defect that I have to pay out of pocket to fix. Now I understand why my friends refuse to buy certain tech items from Amazon.Other aspects of the phone are pretty great safe for the fingerprint reader which is a bit hit or miss but I'm not sure if it's meant to be that way or just a result of the aforementioned bend.","September 1, 2022"
2756,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,Dorian,5,"I chose this phone after using my GS8 beyond its service life. I only buy a new phone every few years when. I've owned several Galaxy phones in the past and have always been satisfied. This phone does it all. Good battery, good screen, good camera, fast charging, 4k video, good audio, good looks, multiple colors, SD card support, wireless charging, wireless power sharing, facial unlock, etc. I have never had any issues with this phone. This is by far my favorite phone ever. If I lost it today I would buy it again without hesitation. I did a lot of research before getting this, and when it was announced, I knew it would be the perfect phone for me. If you're considering this phone, please look up ""MKBHD S20FE"" on YouTube. He highlights a lot of things about this phone and they also gave it the phone of the year award. You cannot beat this value for what you're getting. I love it!","May 26, 2021"
2757,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,Jerome Henry,5,"When my old Samsung S9 stopped working without warning ( network ) I started looking for a phone.  With the supply shortages around the world this was not as easy as it should have been.  I checked retailers and service providers.  It seemed that they only had black phones available if any.  Did not want a black phone.  I also could not afford the latest, best models.  The S21 had all the latest software and features with a beautiful display.  Data transfer from my old phone was very easy.  New phone is fast.  Of all the features that I was concerned about was the speaker.  As a senior with less than perfect hearing I was very pleased with the volume.  I could hear the phone clearly.","April 5, 2022"
2758,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,Dustin,3,Returned. Bought it thinking that it would surpass the 500 dollar TCL I bought in March. That phone is now 340.00 which is closer to the correct price. Didn't take long for the Samsung to start freezing and become slow to respond. So now I have two phones that kinda suck for a total of 1k. One can't be returned and with price drop means I'd be lucky to get a hundred bucks in resale. So returned this one and will live with flaws of the TCL. Maybe I'm expecting too much for the price. 300 bucks should get a decent phone. So for 200 more than I want to spend freezing and glitches this early is not good news. Haven't tried iphone yet. I really don't need a great camera with a million pixels and 4 different lenses. I have a dslr for photos. Will run this TCL in the ground for the next year.,"August 11, 2022"
2759,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Josh,5,"So I've been using Motorola phones the past five or so years, buying a new one every 18 months or so to get an extra 2gb of ram to boost the speed of the android operating system. These phones were mid tier at best phones bought for 200-300 dollars each time. They always got the job done but I was never impressed by the speed of the phone,  often times running Facebook by itself would run slow let alone multiple apps would stall the phones a ton.So over 4-5 years I bought 4 phones for about $1,2000 total, figuring each time I was owning a phone almost as fast as a Samsung for 1/5 the price. I run an Etsy and Ebay business now and my phone is my life. On my Motorola everything was average, the camera, the processor, the ram, the battery, etc.So I had been researching these new Samsung phones,  especially the S23+ Ultra and this Z Fold 5, and feel in love with everything I saw, including the reviews. After owning mid tier phones for half a decade I guess I simply forgot there's a reason why if you love Android over IOS you go with Samsung.Pricey, sure it is. But my God, the display is a thing of beauty to start. The speed is also so incredible I forgot what it was like to multi task on a phone in Nana seconds with absolutely no lag. Samsung truly knows how to build a superior product and it's worth every penny!!12 gb of ram make this thing run multiple applications at once without any problem. In settings there's even an extra mouse that takes 8gb of your internal memory and turns it into more ram,  which is icing in the cake.The phone itself is extremely solid and hard to break or Crack. I bought the case with the s pen built into it and love the features and case. Folding it out to watch you tube videos feels like in using a tablet whenever I want,  as well as running multiple apps side by side flawlessly.The camera is super impressive with the 50mp option that really helps me take great photos of my vintage products I sell. Couldn't be happier.The only, single complaint, if I dare call it that,  would be the battery life is very similar to the moto phones I owned before. Even if I only use the front screen it doesn't last as long as I expected. Luckily it comes with a special charger that literally takes it from 20% to 100% in line 40 minutes,  so I'm satisfied as a whole with the battery,  not enough of a problem to not give it 5 stars.Thanks Samsung, I now remember what is like to have lightning fast operating system, to get every actual notification correctly, a screen to watch movies and videos that's amazing, a Samsung one OS that makes the fold out screen work flawlessly with multiple apps, and settings for every tiny thing possible.I spent $1,500 instead of $300 on a moto, but I'm sure this phone will last me 3-5 years easily. Definitely recommend this product.5 of 5","January 25, 2024"

2761,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Josh,5,Very wonderful phone. I had it for a while. I love the size screen and all but I switched for the Samsung s24 ultra because the fold zoom only went to 30x and ultra is at 100x but if the zoom was higher atleast 50x I probably would have kept. I love the slight slimness of the fold. And how big games are on the big screen. And videos and movies and all.,"August 5, 2024"
2762,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Jean Alphonse BEDOUET,4,"The new hinge design was the selling point this time around, plus the black Friday deal was a bonus. I had the z fold 4 but sat on it and it became useless after that. The front still works but it got really hot most likely to damaged areas. Anyway with the new hinge design I can confidently not have to sit on it again by accident and ruin it. It came in a sealed box and looks brand new. It is unlocked and I just put my Sim card in and it worked like magic. Some reason when it's folded, the front doesn't look as skinny as the 4 did. Good product in my opinion.","November 25, 2023"
2763,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,KaDarius Williams,5,"I love this phone!1) productivity- You are able to have 3-4 apps open on the main screen at once.  It makes multitasking a breeze.2) battery life-  I have been able to go up to 48 hours without charging my battery, but that is with light use.  I am able to go for a solid day with heavy use.  That's just with watching youtube, phone, news, etc.3) durability- seems like a very solid build.  No issues thus far.4) connectivity- Seamless connectivity.  I am able to wirelessly connect to my tv screen with no problem in video or audio.  I am able to use Samsung Dex with a second screen with no problem in video or audio.  I am able to connect seamlessly to other Samsung devices.  No issues with wi-fi, hotspot, mobile data, etc.5) Camera- The cameras work great and give nice quality photos.  You are able to use the main cameras for selfies using the phones external display.Overall I give this phone an A+ rating!","September 27, 2023"
2764,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,androidsin,1,"Samsung Care+ is allowed to be purchased within 60 days of a new phone purhcase from any vendor.  Right after I received the phone, I went through their ridiculous process to take special angle photos of the phone and paid for a warranty.A week later (they promise 24 hours but couldn't do that), they email they cannot warranty the phone.  No reason.  After some calls and digging, they claim the phone is damaged.The photos from out of the box are crystal clear, not fuzzy, and have no odd reflections or elements.  Some person who can't do their job well has blocked me from getting a warranty on something so expensive.  It may be discriminatory from my name.  Regardless, there is no recourse.Lifelong Samsung purchaser of all types of devices - done.  Selling them off over time and no more of my money to an unethical company.

2766,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,kamin,5,"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, as they say. For this phone, I believe it is especially true. If you have an use case that fits it's form factor and specs, then you'll be the happiest camper. In case contrary, you might find yourself with a phone that is more annoying than helpful.I travel quite a bit, need to work on the go, and love to read comics and books. For many years, I've traveled with a tablet (for reading), a laptop (for working), and a phone. I've switched in the airport waiting room and on my seat from one to the other, scrambling to put things away, and having more devices than I'd like going through security. This phone absolutely solves that. I haven't practically used my tablet since I got it and the laptop stays in my bag at the airport and on the plane.By the way, the unfolded phone surface is very similar to a Kindle, so it is a superb replacement for one, especially with the dark theme, that causes less strain to the eyes.Additionally, I used to carry my tablet to the table to watch Netflix while I eat, I colored and drew on my tablet to relax, and I played games on the bigger tablet screen rather than the phone. This phone solves for all that.I like that is narrow, it's easy to hold. When I run outside, I typically carry my phone in my hand so it doesn't bounce in my pockets. This is a very comfortable phone to do that. I had an iPhone 8 Plus before, and it got uncomfortable after a certain time.There is only one drawback that I've found so far. I also go to a climbing gym a couple of times per week. I used to bring my old phone with me and listen to podcasts while I climbed. I didn't care because it was an old iPhone 8. This phone stays in the locker when I go climbing because a) it's not a cheap/old phone, and b) I am concerned the chalk I use for climbing might damage the interior screen.Typing in the narrower screen might take some getting used to, but it is not too annoying, to be frank.I've only had the phone for a few weeks, and I am still learning all there is to it, but for now, it really seemed to have been designed for me. Super happy with my purchase.","December 8, 2023"
2767,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Mohammed R Khan,5,"It really does do a whole lot and might be described as a ""phablet"".  It really is a whole lot like having a computer in your hand given the computing power and larger screen.The thing is that really is a bit of a compromise.  To make the dimensions work out OK they made the front screen a bit narrower than I like and the opened device doesn't fit that well in my hand (and I have fairly big hands).What works fairly well for me with the main screen opened is that I put on a case which has a s-pen holder which goes on the back of where the screen folds.  I'm right-handed so I have my left thumb on the left edge of the phone and my 3rd and 4th fingers holding onto the spine that holds the s-pen.  That makes for a fairly secure hold.So the case makes the phone more workable in one way.  But the case makes it a bit more difficult to get the fingerprint reader to function well.  Without the case the fingerprint reader works very well indeed in my opinion.Despite the utility of having the S-pen spine on the case I'd probably not use a case at all if it weren't for the fact that the caseless phone is sufficiently slippery that it feels like it will fall out of my shirt pocket if I lean forward more than just a little bit.Facial recognition is not great but not that bad either.The features it brings are extensive and I'm still exploring the multiple screen functionalities.My granddaughter enjoys drawing in Samsung Notes and that has more value to me than you might think.  A much better experience than what I got with my previous Samsung S22 Ultra.Yes, I have quibbles but they are not that big a deal and I think that in the Fold 5 we might be looking at the future of portable phones.One other thing?  I hope Samsung will figure out how to store the S-pen in the phone as was the case with the S22 Ultra.  I'm not really sure that will prove to be practical given that it might result in excessive thickness of the phone - and mean less room for the electronics and battery.","November 21, 2023"
2768,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Fernando,2,"I’ve been an avid iPhone user since they first came out. Now with work, this phone caught my attention.TLDR [SUMMARY]: Great device, easy setup, major android improvements throughout out the years (missing some basic iOS features that are nice to have). Two stars because the seller for this device sold me a damaged phone, so word of caution, be careful who you purchase from. The manufacturer screen protector was removed so the warranty is voided as I found out by going to a Samsung authorized repair shop when I noticed screen discoloration after a week of light use.  Also, there is an active SIM card in the phone, but the tray is broken so I can’t remove it 😩. Photos attached.First the pros:1. The size and feel are phenomenal. The phone feels sturdy, not cheap or like it will break easily. The size is great especially for Zoom meetings when away from the desk or working on documents where you need can utilize the large screen for editing on the go (Note: editing text, not formatting an entire document on the go)2. Android has made many improvements over the years. I thought I would hate getting used to the Android OS but it was pretty easy getting used to it. There are a few nice to have features that I still enjoy about my personal iPhone (tap time to scroll to the top of the page/screen you’re looking at, native visual voicemail). The setup was very simple for me to complete.And now the cons:1. The phone arrived with an active AT&T SIM card in it. The tray is broken so when I try to eject it, only the top part comes out. The SIM and rest of the tray remain lodged into the SIM card slot. Yes, I can disable it and use the eSIM from my carrier but for the price of this phone, I don’t feel that’s worth it.2. This device is my work phone so it receives very light usage (meetings, slacks, and email) if I happen to not be in front my computer for any reason. I’ve only had it for about one week when I noticed the crease of the screen is discolored. It has vertical colored lines in it. I thought maybe it could be the manufacturer’s screen protector that might need replacing (which should be covered by warranty). When I took it to a Samsung authorized repair shop, I was informed that there was no screen protector on it. Sadly, I am returning and seeing if I can justify spending more for a brand new one.I’ve attached photos of the screen and the active SIM line.","August 4, 2024"
2769,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Josh,3,"I was pretty excited to get a new phone. put the case on, problem is with the case that protects front screen,, I wouldn't allow for wireless charging. I bought two cases but the second case didn't protect the screen the front screen if I was making a call, not the flip open one. while I talking to someone I dropped it the second day, cracked the front screen pretty bad :(. I even had a front screen protector onp order. The USB C sucks, I've had luck with most of my usb c devices but maybe 1 out 10 just don't like usb C. so I can't really use that to charge the phone.I turn off all my apps, Bluetooth, brightness you name it and it just drains battery. This phone literally lives on the charger. I've never had a phone like this before. yes it was my fault for dropping the phone but it was eating battery life this before that happened. I rarely ever open the phone up either, so I have no idea why it drains the battery so fast. I think the fold is a cool idea, but I'd rather get the flip or just a regular smart phone. I haven't really had to many needs t opens the phone up itself. maybe if the battery life were better I'd be more opt to use it more often.I went ahead and just put my sim back in my old phone for now. I guess I get ahold of samsung support. I can live with the cracked screen, but this battery life issue makes the phone useless to me.

I'm in my early 40's. That was it, while they did work, it was a mild improvement. I wasn't getting the tension headaches from the TV, computer monitors, so figured a more horizontal mobile device would help.And this phone did!!

2840,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Cynthia phillips,4,"This is an amazing phone with some serious pros and cons.  The pros are that it's like having a tablet that you can carry around all day.  I love it, and that I can get so much work done on long subway trips.  If you are someone who has the time to sit and work while ""on the go"", you will love it.  I prefer to flip it sideways for better/wider viewing once it is open.  Past that, you have likely heard of the other pros.  As for the cons, this is not a phone to buy used.  I spend much of my year overseas and in Korea, where the various Folds and Flips have been out for several years.  I know several other business people with Fold 3's, 4's, and they are now getting the 5's.  I also know many young university students with Flip 3's, and 4's.  What you have to know about these phones is that the inner screen is incredibly fragile, as is the video transmission cable in earlier models.  They make a big deal about the hinge, but the real problems are with needing to replace the thin inner screen or possibly cable.  The factory screen protector needs occasional replacement (8 months shows bubbling on model 3's and some 4's), which means giving up your phone and waiting to have it done (or shipping out) and paying for it.  Then, in colder seasons, screens on model 3's have worn out inside of 1 to 2 years, or start to fray along the corners and at the hinge points. Model 4's a bit better, from what I am seeing.  Basically, know that you really should get Samsung Care with this phone, or plan to get rid of it by 1 to 2 years.  Otherwise, once you exceed the base screen warranty, you will pay a ridiculous amount to replace it.  Knowing this, it is just not a good ""long term"" phone for those who like to hold onto it for years and years.  Replacing that film may become prohibitively expensive or a hassle to keep up, if you don't have cheap/fast service nearby, and a full inner screen replacement is like buying a new phone if you don't have Samsung Care.  Likewise, the used value on the Fold phones is atrocious.  How bad?  In Korea, a 1-year old Fold 4 sells for $600 or less.  That's almost a 2/3 loss in value inside of a year!  The reason why is because anyone who purchases it used will have to worry about hundreds of dollars in inner screen replacements, ribbon cable fixing, and have absolutely no coverage for them.  Despite how awesome this phone is, I think it's development was Samsung attempting to create a device that can bring in more repair profit, and shoehorn users into paying for Samsung Care.  They want you buying new phones more often, buying additional warranties, or paying through the nose for repairs.  That's really what the Fold and Flip are about.  If you have the money to burn, and don't mind upgrading every year or investing in Samsung Care and keeping it a bit longer, this phone is incredible.  Case coverage and drop weight of the full phone is also difficult, leaving it damage prone.  Unless you can afford upgrading every 1 to 2 years -- avoid it.","October 10, 2023"
2841,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Taylor M,5,"I love the fold out feature. Great for watching videos, reading, sortingphotos or files, and playing apps. Bright, vivid screens.

2843,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Callie Lily,1,One of the biggest frauds in smartphone history. The screen mechanizm break in about 12 months. It's amazing that the problem is so wide spread and still a company like Samsung continue selling it without taking responsibility what so ever. I am sssoooo disapointed from Samsung after buying their smartphones for 10 years,"July 17, 2024"
2844,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,DR,5,"You either like a fold phone or don’t get it. There are hundreds of people who give the fold phones a negative review because of the price and they don't see the benefit. However, if you are in the camp that sees a large near tablet size screen incorporated into a easily compacted device, then a fold phone has a purpose.I have owned the Fold 2, 3 and 4. Each year I get the next iteration as I love new cell phone technology. And, without hesitation, this is the best Samsung fold to date. There are plenty of reviews stating that the improvements are only incremental. But, incremental improvements are still improvements.I did consider the Pixel Fold. I was hesitant because Samsung has struggled to get the Fold phones to this level of quality. Even the Fold 4, a vast improvement to the Fold 3, was showing its age after only one year. The inner screen cover had separated and the somewhat wonky hinge design was becoming more irritating as other manufacturers had figured out how to make a hinge without a bump.I got my phone from Samsung, unlocked, 512GB. One thing Samsung does is give its loyal customers a huge discount. Between the buyback of the Fold 4, the early order discount, and other perks, the phone was in the $700 dollar range. They also sold a new slim case with an S pen for a large discount.The new phone is slimmer, lighter, and that annoying hinge bump is gone. It opens and closes with a satisfying motion. And, when closed, even with the S pen case, the new phone is slimmer than the old phone with a slim case.There are numerous reviews giving the specs and quality of the phone. From my point of view, the new benefits are:1.) It is slimmer, lighter and seems to have a more solid hinge.2.) The inner screen protector has supposedly been improved with a new glue. Time will tell.3.) The screen is bright. It is so bright that I routinely turn it down, even when outside.4.) A major problem with the old Fold phones is that there was no easy way to store the S pen. The new slim S Pen case is awesome. It is thin and the S Pen stay in a slot that does not make the back thicker or clunky. What Samsung did was to utilize the design that makes photo optics prominent in the back. They revised case, minimized the thickness of the S Pen, and made it fit in the space that is created by protruding thicker lenses.5.) Samsung does make it easy to switch phones. The Smart Switch moved all of my apps and settings. The only thing that is annoying is that all of the bluetooth settings need to be re-installed.6.) I like the narrow front screen. I agree with others that the narrow screen makes it difficult to type and it's not as big as a standard phone screen, like the Pixel Fold. However, the narrowness makes it easy to use one hand to check who's calling, review a message, and get a quick update on any app. If I need more detail, I open the phone and use the full size screen. Also, the Samsung screen, when opened, immediately resizes the app a full screen display. There is no need to rotate the phone as appears to be an issue with the Pixel Fold.If you are thinking of a Fold phone, this is the one to get. It took Samsung five tries, but this is the best one to date. It is refined to near perfection.","August 15, 2023"
2845,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Eran,4,"My first fold phone and wanted it to get the benefits of a tablet with a phone so I traded in my Pixel 7 Pro. Overall I like it but there are a few nagging issues worth mentioning. Sometimes when I press on the screen, nothing happens. It's like the phone isn't getting the signal. The other issue is getting bogged down on some social media sites like Facebook. Trying to move from one profile to another is already a challenge with the ridiculous interface that FB provides but on this phone the issue is just compounded. Also don't like how it goes to a split screen without me asking or wanting it to. Otherwise I like this phone!","September 12, 2023"
2846,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Josh,5,"I like how big the screen is when you play games on the phone like brawl stars or clash royale on the go. Not only you can play the game, you can also text or make important tasks on the apps to be able to do many ways from the apps from music, social media and etc. If anyone who wanted this phone for gamers, it is the perfect gift for christmas from friends and family around you. Pick this phone as a upgrade than how your phone slows down from expectional speed and the quality on how you watch videos from youtube or any app that have your favorite shows and movies. Please pick up the Galaxy Z fold 5 for yours to get for gaming or for your friends or family on the go.","December 9, 2023"
2847,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,kamin,1,"I was warned. I didnt listen. The fold will eventually start to crack, the keyboard will start acting weird, and eventually the joints will stop working. For the price, I should have this phone for a few years. Instead, it lasted four months. The fact that they dont have ANY legit cases for this phone should be all you need to know. Its a nice idea, but the design isnt there yet.","May 4, 2024"

2852,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,CHEF AUGIE,1,"I bought a z fold 4 phone from samsung about a year ago and after about 10 months my phone wifi broke down and I sent it to samsung repair center. After about a week I got the phone back and the wifi was fixed, but when I looked at the phone I saw a lot of scratches on the front display. The display protector had been on the phone since I bought it, and it was still on when I sent it to the Samsung repair center, but when I got it back, there was no screen protector on the phone.I immediately contacted the Samsung service center, and they said they were sorry and would fix it if I sent the phone back to them, so I sent it back to the repair center. A few days later, I got an email from them, and when I checked it, they wanted over $170 to replace the face display on the phone. Obviously, the repair center accidentally scratched a lot of scratches on my phone, and I was angry that they wanted money when I was still under warranty, so I called the service center and asked why they wanted money, and they connected me to the repair center and talked to the repair center supervisor. The supervisor of the repair center said that my phone had many scratches from the beginning, which is ridiculous, and demanded more than $170 to fix it. Despite my repeatedly explaining that my phone had a protective film on it and that there was no protective film when I received it, the samsung repair center manager kept repeating that there were many scratches on it from the beginning and that he could not fix it. In my opinion, Samsung is a company that thinks that it is enough to sell products. I told my friends about it, and they all cursed Samsung a lot. Don't buy any Samsung products.","September 3, 2023"
2853,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Tyler Nguyen,1,"I bought the Z Fold 3 and the Z Fold 4...both internal screens failed within a year. Samsung will not replace they display, they will only replace the screen cover. DoNot buy this phone without the insurance. It is $450+ to fix it and that is after paying $2000+ for the phone. Google these phones and you will see.","October 25, 2023"
2854,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Robert,1,"So, today I returned my Z Fold 4 to the manufacturer's repair center, and was told that the warantee does not cover a bad led. The unit I returned had no visible damage on either the case or the screen, and was used minimally by my wife. I had the unit inspected my TMobile before I sent it in, and they could not help me due to the fact it was purchased directly from Samsung during its promotions. I am writing this so that you understand that the bad leds are not covered by the manufacturer's warantee. I have been purchasing Samsung phones for years, and have never had a problem with them, until this model. Let the buyer beware! Samsung will not stand behind your Fold product....","August 29, 2023"
2855,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Amazon Customer,1,"The novelty effect wears off once the foldable screen breaks by smallest of dust specks, thus the IPX8 rating. After that it becomes nothing more than an expensive paper-weight. Buyers beware!","August 30, 2023"
2856,SAMSUNG Galaxy XCover6,Brandon,5,"I'm really happy with this phone! I upgraded from a Galaxy S20, so some of my comments will include that comparison.Pros:-MicroSD support! This is a requirement for me, and why I didn't really consider the S21 or S22.-Headphone jack! I missed it on the S20.-Replaceable battery! I hadn't had that since the LG G3.-Notification LED! I can't say I was conscious of missing it, and wasn't sure I'd use it. But it's nice to be able to see charge status or if I have a new notification from across the room.-Rugged, grippy build, with IP68. I actually like the plastic; I don't get the trend of slippery, fingerprint-magnet glass sandwiches (like the S20).-Very fast and reliable side-mounted fingerprint sensor. I hate the trend of in-display fingerprint sensors that are slow, unreliable, and leave a smudge on the screen. (The S20 is horrible about this.)-Gorilla Glass Victus+ for the display. It also has an excellent oleophobic coating - doesn't easily get smeared.-Snappy, smooth performance with the efficient Snapdragon 778G. Gets warm occasionally but not hot and doesn't throttle. I don't notice a performance difference compared to a flagship (but then I don't do benchmarks or heavy gaming). (The S20 got really hot and throttled.)-USB 3 with video out and Samsung Dex support. USB video out often isn't listed on specs sheets, but it's usually only on flagships, so it's nice to have it here.-Great battery life. I can easily get 2+ days despite the not-huge battery (4050 mAh).-The Wifi and LTE range and speed are noticeably better than on my S20! (My rural Verizon-partner carrier does not have 5G so I can't comment on that.)-Extra assignable keys-Reasonable price-Software support equivalent to flagships (month security updates,, 4 Android updates, 5 years of security updates)-Clear, sharp display without PWM according to notebookcheck - PWM is a dimming method that uses flicker. OLEDs and some LCDs use it - this doesn't - no flicker! So it's easier on the eyes than OLED if you're flicker-sensitive. I find it to be bright enough.Cons:-It is a rather big and heavy phone. Think S22 Ultra with a rugged case.-The display is LCD, not AMOLED, and according to notebookcheck, the color accuracy isn't great. I admit that the colors aren't as vibrant as AMOLED - they don't ""pop"" as much. But I like the display anyway, and as noted above, it's sharp and clear and without PWM.-Being LCD, there's also no Always-On Display. I adjusted by turning on Lift to Wake, plus the notification LED and really fast fingerprint sensor help.-It has a notch for the front camera. It's a small waterdrop notch, but it's still my first phone with a notch and I don't love it. With the big bezels Samsung could have put the camera in the bezel instead.-Big bezels (but I don't care).-According the specs the cameras aren't as good as on a flagship. But they're good enough for me.-Slow charging. 15W ""Fast Charging"" was fast 5 years ago with much smaller batteries. At least battery life is good, and charging doesn't make the phone hot, and the battery is changeable.-The built-in mono audio is okay, but certainly not premium. Still, I can hear and be heard clearly and the volume is fine. The S20 certainly has better audio. But my friend said he could hear me better when I was on the XCover6 than on the S20, so maybe it has a better mic. Or maybe it was the better Wifi performance.Other notes:This model - SM-G736U1, USA Unlocked - is not identical to the European models reviewed on notebookcheck and YouTube, or the specs listed on GSMArena. The network bands supported are different. Also, some reviewed models have dual SIM slots plus dedicated MicroSD. This model does not. It has one SIM slot, one MicroSD slot, and supports e-SIM.-It's hard to find a network bands list for the USA Unlocked model. I can confirm that it supports LTE Band 13, required for Verizon and Verizon partner support. I had to check this because a lot of Samsung Unlocked devices - like the A53 - do not support Band 13. My rural Verizon partner requires B13 and it works great. No 5G is available in my area so I don't know what it supports there.That's a lot, hope it's helpful. Though I wish it had faster charging, I'm very happy with this phone.","November 23, 2022"
2857,SAMSUNG Galaxy XCover6,vera s,5,"My last android I purchased was the v20 back in 2016 and it worked amazing up until about 2020 when Android stopped receiving updates and apps stopped working.  I've been searching and searching for a new android that has a replaceable battery and there aren't many options at all. Most of them are very cheap, bottom of the line and noname brands or outdated specs..... this is when the clouds opened, the light beamed down and the name Samsung Xcover Pro 6 appeared. (Obviously dramatic and didn't really happen).The phone was almost identical size to the v20...a larger phone with lots of real estate for my fat fingers to wander free range...Speed is fast, no lag, screen is fast and responsive, screen is bright and battery life seems pretty good for heavy use.So with the above I already was pleased but then.... the phone has a replaceable battery! GENIUS! Phones outlast their batteries and planned obsolescence socks for us the consumer. Samsung did us right with a good phone WITH replaceable battery.I also like the 2 programmable extra buttons this phone has...I haven't dabbled with them yet as I've only had the phone for 1 week but I already have used the previous programmed flashlight.I picked up the unlocked version which I was able to pop my Sim card right in and with seconds my phone was loaded, and accessing t-mobile network. No issues at all.Speaker is loud, so far my voice is clear to the other people I've spoken with and asked, Bluetooth works well and easily paired to my Sony headphones.Another PLUS is the 3.5mm jack! Bluetooth is a subpar quality of audio transmission to analog and I frequently use my studio headphones with my phone when checking mixes. Big kudos to keeping the 3.5mm jack alive!I used the camera and it seems fine...photos were clear and seemed to be balanced for indoors photos.Absolutely happy with my purchase. If you have a v20 you love but want to upgrade....just do it! Press buy. It's worth it.","November 1, 2023"
2858,SAMSUNG Galaxy XCover6,Brandon,1,"The worst is that the phone is advertised as rugged, but the glass shattered at the first fall. And the warranty doesn't include its repair. Then, after the screen was changed and the phone got wet the screen stopped working altogether.The other thing I don't like is that its proportions are odd, it is too long for its width, and the text doesn't fit on the screen.In short, after less than a year, I have to change the phone for something else.","July 16, 2024"
2859,SAMSUNG Galaxy XCover6,Pete,4,"For a Samsung galaxy family device this is a pretty nice option. Water, dust, and shock resistance. A HEADPHONE JACK, AND REPLACEABLE BATTERY!!! Not $1000. Cool. The fingerprint scanner is built into the thin sliver of a power ""button"", rendering it effectively worthless. It will work only from certain angles, within a narrow band of skin moisture level (not too moist, not too dry), and with the button freshly wiped off. If you just washed your hands, too bad. My Lg V20 from 2016 didn't have this problem, but anti-consumer practices are one of the only remaining avenues for continued unsustainable ""endless"" profit growth. So, something has to suck. At least it's not coated in glass, made to break, and incapable of producing audio without a blue tooth compression layer for twice the price. It's as good as a Galaxy thing is going to get, and probably the last one with a removable, user replaceable battery, and headphone jack.","April 6, 2024"

2861,SAMSUNG Galaxy XCover6,Microfinish Employee,3,"I've had this phone for a little over a year and in general I've loved it except for frequent, false claims of water being in the charging port. It was the replacement for a long line of very durable and reliable, but now completely obsolete LG XVenture phones. I work as a stone fabricator, my hobbies all involve manual labor and I have 3 kids, so I legitimately need a durable phone. This seemed to fit the bill. The removable battery is a really cool and sadly uncommon feature, the camera is good enough, the functionality is great, and its also fairly rugged. But the screen broke on mine after several months of ownership when it fell on a metal coathanger, of all things. Ok. Had it replaced by a local shop. Great. All set. Worked for another few months. Then last week, out of the blue, the backlight dies. You can still barely see stuff on the screen (sometimes), but there's no lighting, so you cant really do anything with it. So I figure that the screen is shot (the backlight being part of the screen, after all) and order a replacement which I installed without issue. But the backlight still isn't illuminating the screen. A bit of research exposed that this is a known issue that Samsung refuses to address. Samsung tech support chat was utterly useless. Buy a new phone or send it in and pay them to maybe repair it the guy said... Screw it. I'll bring it to the local shop and see if they can fix it so I can have it as a backup, but I'm done with this thing as my everyday use phone. It's replacement is not another Samsung. If this is the most rugged phone they can make, I'm out.","July 2, 2024"
2862,SAMSUNG Galaxy XCover6,mike,5,"I FINALLY had to replace my LGV20 & it certainly wasn't an easy feat finding one as competent. Thank goodness for this one because it not only matched up to it's competency, it surpassed it in many aspects! First off, all phones should have a replaceable battery (an easily replaceable battery I suppose I should say). Due to my last phone having one I was able to hold on to it for many years longer than my friends and family held on to theirs without one, so that was a must have. Secondly, it's a newer phone but still sports an external jack, another must have! It's lightning fast compared to my LG (but to be fair to my old LG, it Was old and pretty much maxed out on RAM), and it's fully customizable, which is always nice, and the battery charges super fast and so far, lasts super long! The speakers are loud and great too! My only critics are that it's rather large (even longer than my LG) & the fingerprint sensor isn't as friendly as my LG's was... but if you're looking for a capable android that will last a long time and won't break your wallet, I'd say this is the phone!","August 16, 2023"
2863,SAMSUNG Galaxy XCover6,Matt,5,"Good phone, and the programmable keys are cool. This is the only current-gen phone I am aware of that still supports a headphone jack, removable battery, and an SD card. Rooting the phone and removing the Samsung+Google bloatware/spyware was simple, as is the case for all the other Samsung devices I have owned. For $600 as of 12/2022, I am very happy.A note on carrier support: 4g functionality works on US domestic AT&T, 5g does not. When at the AT&T store they insisted this device would not work on their network AT ALL, but I insisted on getting a sim ""for my other phone"", and go figure, the xcover works fine with that sim.So unless you are one of those ""special"" people that needs to stream 4k video on the bus, this is a fully functional phone on AT&T, and I highly recommend it over every single other phone made after the 3G shutdown.PS, USBc charge brick is not included.","December 13, 2022"

2865,SAMSUNG Galaxy XCover6,jk,4,"General overview during two months of ownership:I had this phone for less than two months.  I think it's a good enough smartphone.  I only use this smartphone for normal everyday use such as web browse, text message, and watch less than ten videos that are less than 15 minutes long per day.  The battery usually ends up at around 50% at the end of the day.  I only charge my phone to 85% and that is what I start with at the start of the day.Form factor:In regards to the form factor of the smartphone, I like the shape and it is super easy to handle compared to my old S20 Ultra 5G.  This fits so much easier in my pant pockets and jacket pockets.  I love that fact that I don't have to use a sim card ejector tool in order to install my sim card or microSD card because of the removeable back cover.  I love having removeable back cover.Camera:I love the fact that in normal camera mode the software makes the camera take super fast and in-focus pictures.  I think this is really convenience for people who want to take a quick photo and not have to change modes or have to deal with manual camera settings.  Easy to take a photo of items that I want to show to other people.Battery:Removeable!  I bought spares!Misc. complaints:I wish I can buy an accessory to charge my spare batteries to 85% or a desire capacity.","March 1, 2023"

I saw it report AT&T LTE, LTE+, and 5G and ran speedtests and made calls fine.  Also saw T-Mobile LTE, LTE+, 5G, 5G UC and ran speedtests and made calls fine.Verizon I wasn't able to get it activated on a line due to Verizon refusing to activate it on a non-business account, but it did see my Network Extender on band 13.Seems really strange, but I'm going to have to return it as Verizon isn't allowing me to use it in spite of the phone saying it's compatible with Verizon.","January 11, 2023"

2871,SAMSUNG Galaxy XCover6,Louie08213,5,"One of the reviewers posted a very thorough review spelling out all the pros and a few minor cons. I'm a bit confused by another review that's stated that Samsung prevents Gboard from functioning on this device and that you can't use voice to text no matter what. Voice to text is all I use on this and all my Samsung devices, I can't text with my fingers for the life of me, it's way too time-consuming. As for Gboard, it works just fine on this phone but I prefer the Samsung keyboard. The only pet peeve I have so far with this phone is that the top and side key which provide the ability to Launch any app you choose including the flashlight will not turn on while the screen is off, i.e. the screen must be lit up in order for these key features to work which is counterproductive since the whole point of having these assigned keys are to Launch whatever you want quickly. I have no idea if this can be rectified in future updates but certainly hope so. Other than that, I'm very happy with this phone.","December 9, 2022"
2872,SAMSUNG Galaxy XCover6,Matt M,2,"I have owned this phone for 8 hours, I work in IT, I literally cannot get this phone to get messages from some of my contacts still w/ the same sim card I used for my moto g power. When I configured the phone  I removed most of the Samsung bloat. Samsung prevents you from removing all of it and prevents you from using gboard over their insecure & inferior Samsung keyboard. There is no setting for shaking your phone awake like my moto g power has. This phone also uses a microphone app that wont work w/ android 13 so no voice to text no matter what you do. Fast charging is slow af as well. Also hope you have a wall to usb c brick b/c this thing doesnt come w/ one. I should have bought a mototrola or fixed my current one.Golden lining is that the phone is super easy to work on and repair. I have not worked on mine but watched a lot of tear downs and read a lot of reviews. battery change in 5 minutes is pretty solid w/ no heat gun required. Also charging port and aux jack are daughter boards easy to replace w/ no soldering. Literally the only good things about this phone esp at this price point.If you are looking to deploy a fleet of them, you better know what you are doing, if my employer made me use one, i would look for another job.If you are a end user buying for personal use, just buy a moto g power 2022 and a heat gun.

2873,SAMSUNG Galaxy XCover6,Amazon Customer,3,"If this were just a review for the phone, it'd probably get 5 stars. It does everything you want it for, removable battery, waterproof, everything else. It's great. However...The item listing says (Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, USCellular) and I don't know which of those is accurate, but AT&T certainly isn't. And I know that's AT&T's fault, not Samsung's, as the phone is ~capable~ of working on that network, but you can't advertise a phone as being AT&T compatable when that carrier is going to actively work to deny you coverage. And they will. At best I got phone and text and no data, then I got nothing at all.If this phone works on your carrier, get it. If that carrier is AT&T look elsewhere regardless of what Samsung says.

Did a reset and the issue continued. Called Amazon let them know the troubleshooting steps I went through and they said a replacement was suggested. Unfortunately I was told they can only issue a refund after a return for this item due to ""system limitation"". So I would be left without a phn while I wait for for Amazon to receive the phone, approve the return, process a refund and once I finally receive the refund I'll have to resubmit an order and have a new phone sent to me.

This is a great Android cell phone, as it seems to have missed most of the consumer-hostile trends in the mobile phone industry.  Unlike most current devices, this one has a replaceable battery, headphone jack, and SD card slot.  It also seems to be well designed and durable.  It is exactly the phone that I wanted, and I have been very happy with it.My only major complaint with the device itself is that it ships without a manual or charging device.  A PDF of the manual is available for download, but, for $600, a printed copy should come with the device itself.  I have not been able to find a service manual for this anywhere, unfortunately.I ended up getting the Koamtac charging cradle (not the Xcover model on Amazon), which charges using the pogo pins on the base of the device.  It is expensive, but works well.There does seem to be an issue with parts availability for this model in the USA.  I wanted to get a spare back cover for mine.  This is part number GH98-47657A, but good luck buying one in the US.  Samsung support send me to Samsung Parts, which does not sell that part and sent me back to Samsung support, which was useless.  Why are these parts not available in a web store for easy purchase?  I ended up buying spares from a company in Belgium (with inflated shipping prices), but it seems nutty that genuine replacement parts seem to be unobtainium in the US through official channels.Anyway, this is a good product, but Samsung needs to provide a service manual and better parts support in the US.","April 7, 2023"

Battery life also seems good (in the few days we've had this).  I just wish it had wireless charging.  But it does have NFC, and can screen-cast- which is great for her, though she needs help to do it.The USB interface is as fast as the one on my Note 10 (using a 10Gbps cable), which isn't to say it's that fast.  And it charges rapidly.It's water-resistant enough for snorkeling, so that won't be an issue- though I don't think she got her old phone wet, ever.  It's plenty loud enough for her needs.  I have already sat on it (on the seat of her wheeled walker) for about 10 minutes, and that didn't pose any problem at all.  I showed her that the screen is scratch-proof (by scraping it with a knife and an ice pick).  So it will hold up in her purse just fine.Once she got the hang of answering it, it's been great so far.  She's on Consumer Cellular, so the junk/spam/scam calls are rolling in and she gets lot s of practice.","November 4, 2022"
2919,SAMSUNG Galaxy A23,Dennis Woodward,5,"So far, the phone is performing well.  It's very fast and speaker calls sound very clear.  Signal reception also appears to be good.  You will need the IMEI number found on the box (if you can read it) or in settings/about phone to give to your cell provider for activation.  There are TWO IMEI codes provided. The holder for SIM and Micro SD cards is very flimsy.  Use great care when removing and installing cards.  The SIM slot beside the SD slot, uses the IMEI number for SLOT 1.  Knowing this information may save you a headache, when you call your provider to set-up your new phone registration.  One nice feature is the ability to use the volume bar to answer calls and the power button to end calls.  This can come in handy when driving or where daylight is too bright to see the screen. Another good feature is EASY MODE which makes icons and print easier to see.","November 15, 2022"
2920,SAMSUNG Galaxy A23,Lunix,4,"My 5-year-old trusty LG G6 was finally getting to the point where I had to charge it several times a day, so I started phone shopping. Not gonna pay $800+ for a giant phone with way more features than I need, and not gonna go with an inexpensive, off-brand phone either. Found the A23 and the reviews looked promising, especially when it was on sale.Setting up the phone and getting the apps copied over was easy - I assume I got lucky sticking my SIM card in the correct slot. Had to re-do a few log-ins as I could not copy some accounts over from the old phone. Fingerprint reader works well enough, although it was tedious to get my finger scanned all the way.It has taken me a while to get used to the newer version of Android, and a few things are annoyingly over-complicated, compared to the old phone, but I'll get used to it. Performance and call quality are good, and the 5G screams. I typically get home from work with at least 75% battery left -- which is much better than the LG phone, even when it was new.Sadly, the camera resolution is poor - digital zoom gets grainy pretty fast, and zooming / cropping a 1x photo shows this as well. However, the macro and portrait features are nice, and do take good photos. The flash feature is kinda weird -- even if you turn it off, it may still come on if the overall picture area is dark.Overall, I'd say this is a good phone for kids / seniors / frugal folks -- good performance, battery life, speaker volume, and screen brightness. I wish it was a tad smaller -- but unless I want to go to the dark side (smaller iPhone), I'll have to get used to it.","December 3, 2022"

2925,SAMSUNG Galaxy A23,Marisol Mercado,5,"My old Samsung Galaxy S5 finally stopped making or receiving phone calls (it would let me text, but not make/get phone calls, and my provider was unable to find a solution). SO, it was time for a new phone. I searched the web, read a lot of reviews, and was set to get the S23, but just couldn't see spending THAT kind of money on a gadget that I use mostly to make calls and occasionally check the news, watch videos, and write emails while away from home. I got this from Amazon, and took it into my Verizon company store. For about $30 they gave me a sim card and transferred my stuff from the old to the new phone. Mind you, this phone is larger and heavier than I thought it might be. But it's easy to use and works quickly. I do wish Samsung would make a small, trim budget phone. That can't be so hard to do.","March 6, 2023"

In terms of hardware the A23 is actually a slight downgrade from my S20+, but it works well, has a larger screen, a good camera, and so far I haven't had any major issues with it. Haven't even cracked the screen, despite a number of drops. I hope for several more years of good use. So far it's been a way better experience than getting a phone under contract through a service carrier.","July 15, 2024"

My phone has a few occasional glitches, but that could just be because I'm clumsy and drop it.The only thing that REALLY sucks is the camera. The quality of the camera is only slightly better than my first touch screen phone in 2016 that my mom picked up from a dollar general. I bought this phone despite seeing the reviews because surely it could not be that bad... but I was wrong. It really sucks. For the price, I'm really disappointed in just how bad the camera is.

Also, be wary because the phone is not completely unlocked to all carriers....had to switch from Verizon Wireless to T-mobile. I purchased it knowing it didn't come with a charger but it's still ridiculous for it not to be included and it's not a charger that you'd commonly find in your house either it's specific for Samsung.

2938,SAMSUNG Galaxy A23,Lunix,2,"If you are already using Samsung products, you'll probably love this phone. If not, good luck!Samsung tries to make you convert your basic apps to theirs (calendar, photo gallery, etc) and you can't uninstall their apps.The fingerprint sensor is on the side of the phone and is a button. So you have to push hard enough to detect your fingerprint, but not too hard or else you've pressed the on/off button. Half the time it doesn't even recognize my fingerprint and I have to reposition.The face recognition works a fraction of the time.The screen will not turn on (even just to show you the time) unless you press the on/off button.There's about a 1 second delay when taking pictures. Which doesn't sound like a whole lot, and wouldn't be if you're just shooting inanimate objects, but I have 4 kids that I'm trying to get pictures of. They can move a lot in one second! Also, it takes another second or two or three between pictures if you're trying to take multiple in a row. The camera may have a ton of MP, but it lags bad and the pictures really aren't that great. Also, if your location isn't turned on, it will prompt you to turn it on every single time you open your camera.I'm returning this because it's just not user friendly.","October 12, 2022"

2998,SAMSUNG Galaxy A23,Lunix,1,"Received this phone as a Christmas gift from my husband and immediately hated it. It was a major downgrade from my galaxy s9. Annoyingly slow and laggy, bizarre design for power button, and the among the worst camera quality I have ever seen. I used it for all of 30 mins before transferring SIM card & data back to my current phone and throwing this thing back into its packaging to be returned. My s9 will surely start to die on me soon due to its age and inability to recieve updates, so I desperately need to find a new phone, but the galaxy A23 will NOT be my replacement. I guess if you don't care about features and only want something for talk/text it would be okay... maybe? Idk. Even the sound output sucked. I would just say to avoid this piece of junk altogether.","December 31, 2023"

Countable seconds would pass between taps and a visible reaction from the phone. Typing was impossible.

3008,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Narine,5,"I originally got a Zflip 5 and liked the compactness and versatility, hence I decided to give the fold a try!Pros:- the beautiful, large screen is perfect for multi-tasking, for example: texting somebody about a vacation destination and taking quick screenshots and sending it right to them on the other side of your screen- The external cameras are an amazing improvement from last year, likely because Samsung tuned their auto-ai-whatever image processing.- the foldable screen makes it it's own stand! YouTube even has a built in mode that turns the bottom half into the video controls!- The springs don't drag it open or close like my flip, so I can stand it at almost any angle!- materials make it feel premium! Samsung put a lot of effort into perfecting the foldable feeeling of quality. I also own an S24 ultra and they feel almost identical in terms of trust I have in the physical design and materials. Extremely well machined!- using the outside screen doesn't feel terrible and cramped as I had expected. It's a lot like when I got my flip and thought it was weirdly tall, but I got used to it.- ecosystem integration is finally to a point I can recommend people get everything Samsung, like the watch, ring, and tablets! Copy and paste works, if I need to open a message on my phone from my watch, I can immediately just open my phone, copy an OTP, etc.Ehhh:- Battery life is middling, it will last you all day, BUT with low-medium use. I am in a job where I use it around 4 hours a day and it struggles to be at even 20% at the end of my day.- Samsung bloatware is Mostly removable, I miss my pixel phones with completely uninstallable to no bloatware. I hate that we have non-uninstallabke bloatware like AR camera or Bixby (Google assistant FTW)Cons:- app support is getting closer to being more widespread but still not where it needs to be, some apps have issues with both the external and internal display ratios, whether it be too skinny to display things, or too wide to display things properly.- front/internal camera is terrible, it is taking a picture through the screen, but it is simply unacceptably bad- Brightness of the screen is not enough for outdoor use. I went to a local restaurant today and noticed I could barely see the screen with extra brightness enabled in overcast weather.Overall 8.5/10TL:DRPhysical design is impeccable, however software support and battery life hold it back from being what Samsung envisions: the perfect compact phone. 8.5/10","July 28, 2024"
3009,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,S Davis,4,"The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 improves upon that of its predecessor. Its refined, sharper, and lighter. The model design is a little bit longer and following the design choice of the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. However there is so things it could improve of on the future. The first thing is the phone isn't the smartest software wise with autocorrect. I am hoping with the next One UI update it receives an adequate update. But the biggest fix for the future would be, the design. Don't get me wrong its absolutely stunning in pink and screen quality however, the body design makes it difficult to hold. On countless times since it's delivery, it has dug into my skin and left indentions. So if holdability is important you may want to consider that. Other than that, the phone is stunning!

3026,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,MsRubicon,4,"First things first, I have many Samsung devices in my household so in terms of quality they are usually some of the best. My primary phone is a Samsung Galaxy S22 and it's been so great I was expecting to keep stay with that phone for year but the opportunity to check this one out arose.Goods:This is a very high quality phone. The build is great, it's slim, has a satisfying hinge close, solid quality speakers, screens look great, and I can go on. It's obviously got all the new bells and whistles in there. Galaxy AI is the new thing with it. It includes translation features, summarizing websites, notes assist with formatting/decorating, and photo/drawing assists. They seem to work fine but honestly not game changing in terms of day to day use. The massive folding screen is cool. It's got a function where if it's like half open you can use the bottom part as a mousepad+other functions and the top part as your screen. Not all apps support it very well but most basic ones I've used work fine. I really don't have any faults with the features and the overall quality of the phone, it's great which it should be for being nearly 2k. That's where I get to my criticisms.Downsides:So it's hard for me to to give this a full 5 stars for a couple reasons. For the cost of this device I expect a little more. It's got many features and functions to work with an S pen but somehow does not come with one. Doesn't even come with a holder for one. It doesn't come with a power brick either, not a huge deal for me but for 2k? Even just a screen protector for the front screen would've been nice. Come on. Yes I am being picky and honestly if you are looking at a phone that costs this much you probably don't care to spend a little more on an S pen and case with holder but I just had to put it out there. Another point, as someone who isn't an artist or doesn't power use their phone I don't see myself getting the full use of a giant screen like this. I can see drawing and taking notes, which would be nice with an s pen... but there are videos which do look nice on the big screen.While my large ""downsides"" section seems to make it look like I don't like this phone, in reality I do because it's a great phone. I love that the single main screen is super functional as a regular phone then I can open it up for big screen movies or videos. I can't in good conscious give this phone any lower than a 4 since there are really no issues with the phone itself, just the value and what's included in the box.Overall, this phone isn't for everyone or even for most people I'd say but if you think that it would be a good fit for you then you will not be disappointed. I would definitely recommend this phone to people who could get good use out of a phone like this!","July 31, 2024"
3027,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,S Davis,4,"This is Samsung’s flagship phone and I had to give it a try. I thought this would be overly bulky to hold and carry but it is not bad at all. The biggest difference is the thickness. Samsung has  made the cover screen slightly larger than on the Fold 5 and it is very usable. Sure, it is narrower than most standard phones, but this make for easy one handed use. I also find the squared off corners more appealing than the more rounded ones on the Fold 5.  The main inside screen is fantastic. Super sharp and bright. The crease is noticeable but I do not find it intrusive. This screen is great for streaming videos. The biggest advantage is the way you can have several apps displayed at once for multitasking. Battery life is sufficient. I am new to this phone so have been playing with it a lot. I can still get pretty much a whole day’s usage without charging. Charging is decently fast but not as good as some competitors. Considering this is Samsung’s top phone, I wish they would have provided a bigger battery with quicker charging.  The processor is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 so performance, as expected is quick and snappy. In fact, I have changed the performance profile in settings to light as opposed to standard and have not noticed a decrease in performance. This did increase battery life which was a nice plus. The cameras (5 of them) are acceptable. The main cameras, a 50mp main camera, a 10mp, 3X optical zoom telephoto, and a 12mp ultra wide take very good photos. The phone also has a 10mp selfie camera on the cover screen and a 4mp camera on the main screen when opened. As I said, the cameras are acceptable but given the price of this phone, Samsung could do better. Their competition has.  This phone comes with the usual Samsung bloatware, but also has an impressive array of AI features. I find the translating apps especially impressive. Some of the AI features are really neat (circle to search, sketch to image, portrait studio) but not something I would use on a daily basis. More of something to wow your friends with.  Overall, I am very happy with this phone. I am sure the more I use it, the more great features I will find. However, at a price of $1899, I feel Samsung could have done better. Especially the camera and the battery and charging. This super expensive phone will certainly not be for everyone, but if you multi task a lot, have to have the latest and greatest tech, and can find a good deal out there with trade ins, it could be for you.","July 30, 2024"
3028,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Frank in PA,4,"This is a pretty solid phone with the interesting folding gimmick. The price point feels a bit high when compared to other phones on the market, but it works great and is very responsive. The new biometrics reader on the side was a bit of a surprise at how well it works and the camera is really nice, all of them, btw. The unfolded screen becomes large enough that you start seeing ""desktop"" resolution settings for website layouts, or you can dock apps to each half and run multiple at the same time, which is cool. You can't use the front screen with the inner screen, but that makes sense. I do find myself gravitating towards the front more often for quick things, but if I'm interested I'll open it up and the transition is pretty seamless.It supports a pen, but doesn't have any way to store it. There's no wall charger, just the cord as well.","August 14, 2024"
3029,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Robby,5,"I've been using this phone exclusively for over a week now. The setup was easy and fun (switched from my S22 Ultra and transferred over my settings). I also got the S Pen case, which I've been enjoying since the S pen on the inner screen is pretty useful. Here have been my experiences so far:Overall:An amazingly powerful phone that's fast, fun, unique, powerful, and has very few downsides compared to a 'regular' slab phone.Look and feel:I think it looks incredible, both the designs and the screen. It feels a little heavy when closed, but almost like magic it feels very lightweight when open due to the large screen size. The front screen is thin and tall, but I actually enjoy that because it's easy to type one-handed. The screens are extremely bright and at the right angle the crease on the inner screen virtually disappears.Performance:This thing is FAST! No lag, very smooth (I changed my animations to 0.5x in developer settings to make it feel snappier).Battery:Better than expected. I'm getting more hours out of this than my S22 Ultra, even though I'm using this phone more and often have it open to use the large screen.Cameras:Overall, it takes good pictures. The one area where it doesn't keep up with other flagship Samsung phones is the zoom. If you're coming from any phone 2+ years old, it'll probably still be an overall upgrade.Features:Way more than any other phone that I'm aware of. Samsung's ecosystem is now bigger and better than Apple's in my opinion, it works great with Windows, it makes excellent use of the large inner screen, the S pen is very handy, the fingerprint scanner works great, etc. etc.Surprises:I don't like the inner camera that 'disappears' when you're not using it. I think the pixelation over the small cutout is more distracting than if it were just a cutout. Luckily, this can be turned off in the Goodlock app.The fingerprint scanner works great, and I actually thought I'd like the location better, but I think I prefer the under-display scanner on the S22 Ultra in terms of location vs the power button.The weight doesn't bother me, and it often feels smaller in my pocket even though it's thicker than most phones.Wireless charging still works well with the S pen case, which is great!","August 8, 2024"
3030,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Robby,5,"-----  SUMMARY  -----Verdict:The Galaxy Z Fold 6 is a top-of-the-line foldable phone with a stunning design, powerful performance, and a versatile camera system. I think it’s the best foldable phone on the market, but its high price tag and bulky form factor may not be for everyone.Pros:  -  Stunning design  -  Powerful performance  -  Versatile camera system  -  Long battery life  -  Unique features that take advantage of the foldable designCons:  -  High price tag  -  Bulky form factor  -  Camera not as powerful as some other premium phones-----  DETAILS  -----Design:The Galaxy Z Fold 6 looks like any other regular phone when it's closed. It has squared edges that remind me of the Galaxy S24 Ultra, which I like. When I use the cover screen, I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything because I have full access to all the phone's features, regardless of which screen I'm using.On the right edge, you'll find a volume rocker and the power button, which also serves as a fingerprint sensor. I was initially worried about how well the fingerprint sensor would work because it's so small, but it turns out to be one of the best I've used on a phone. There's a USB-C port at the bottom and speaker grilles at the top and bottom. There's also a SIM tray, but the phone supports eSIM as well.The build quality of the Galaxy Z Fold 6 is top-notch. It's clear that this is a well-made device that's worth its premium price tag. The tablet-sized 7.6-inch internal screen is the standout design feature, and it doesn't disappoint. The display is sharp and vibrant, and I barely notice the crease when I'm using it straight on. At an angle, you can definitely tell it's there, but that's the case with any foldable phone.The Z Fold 6's bulk and weight are its main drawbacks. While Samsung has done an impressive job making it more compact than its predecessors, it's still noticeably thicker and heavier than most other smartphones on the market. This is inherent to foldable phones due to their dual screens and complex hinge mechanisms. If you're considering purchasing the Z Fold 6, I highly recommend trying it out in a store first to ensure you're comfortable with its size and weight before making a decision.Features:AI is all the rage in tech these days, and Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 6 is no exception. One feature that I've had a blast playing with is Sketch to Image. You can use the Samsung Notes app to sketch something and have AI turn it into a pro-looking image. There are lots of styles to choose from, like watercolor or 3D cartoon. I've been seriously impressed with the results. Another cool thing you can do with Sketch to Image is take a photo and draw on it, then bring your creation to life. I'm not exactly an artist, but the Sketch to Image feature still manages to make some pretty cool illustrations and pics.Portrait Studio is another fun one. You can turn your selfies into paintings, sketches, or 3D cartoons. The results can be a bit unpredictable. Sometimes they're amazing, and sometimes they're a little, well, unflattering or unrecognizable. But it's still a pretty cool feature.One feature that I've tried out that takes advantage of the Galaxy Z Fold 6's unique foldable design is conversation mode in the Interpretor app. It shows translated text on both the outward-facing cover screen and the inner screen. This lets two people having a conversation see the translations at the same time, all while just holding the phone in one spot. I can totally see this being useful when I go on my international travels, which I'm hoping to do soon.These are just a few of the standout features that I wanted to mention. There are a bunch of other features from Samsung or Google built into the phone, and you can always access Google Gemini with a swipe from the corner. What I'd love to see is more features like conversation mode in Interpretor that use both screens. That would make the Z Fold 6 an even more compelling choice.Performance:The Z Fold 6 has been an exceptional performer. I haven't encountered any lag, even when multitasking or running demanding applications. From casual browsing to video editing and graphically intensive games, the Z Fold 6 handled everything with ease. While it does warm up slightly during particularly intense tasks, it never becomes excessively hot to the touch. In normal usage scenarios, it maintains a comfortable temperature. You can expect consistently smooth graphics and rapid performance from the Z Fold 6, making it an ideal device for both work and entertainment.Camera:The Z Fold 6 features a versatile triple-lens rear camera system. The 50-megapixel main camera captures stunning, detailed shots with vivid colors. The 12-megapixel ultrawide lens is perfect for expansive landscapes and group photos, offering a broader perspective. The 10-megapixel telephoto lens provides a respectable 3x optical zoom, allowing you to get closer to distant subjects without sacrificing image quality. While it may not have the 5x optical zoom of the Galaxy S24 Ultra and iPhone 15 Pro Max, the Z Fold 6's camera still excels in capturing sharp and vibrant images. Overall, the Z Fold 6's camera is well-equipped to handle various photography scenarios, making it a reliable choice for mobile photography enthusiasts.Battery Life:The Z Fold 6 can easily last an entire day. Even when I use it heavily, doing things like using GPS, streaming music, and taking photos, I still usually have more than 20% of my battery left at the end of the day. However, the key factor that affects battery life is how much you use the internal screen. If I use the internal screen for content like watching YouTube videos, the battery drains much faster than when doing other tasks. Despite this, the battery life hasn't let me down.","September 1, 2024"
3031,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Range Finder,5,"I have been using Samsung phones since the Note 3 and I very rarely upgrade once I get used to a phone. Before switching to this I had been using the Samsung Note 9  for years as it had great features that were hard to beat from even the newer models. This device however is the exception to that rule.Going from a single screen phone to this amazing multi screen foldable was to me night and day. My vision is not the best so I normally get the larger screen phones to assist in that regard. Not counting all the other features that I am loving, just being able to flip open the phone into a much larger tablet like screen is so helpful. Unless looking at the screen from an angle I can barely even notice the crease in the center of the foldable screen and as for touch its only noticeable when using an s-pen.Coming from the Note 9 the front screen was a little narrower but not by much. This device doesn't have those beveled screen edges so you get more room for the actual screen. Having the the fingerprint scanner on the side makes it much easier to unlock single handedly as well.As for the cameras, coming from an older model these things blow my mind. They can take such clear pictures even in lower light situations. There are three that come with this phone and each has there own boons.The speed of the device is also a great improvement from my old phone. I am able to quickly navigate apps as well as play games without any issues. The device keeps up with multiple tasks running without any performance degradation.Overall I am blown away with how this tech has advanced and loving this new device. I have only had this for a about a week so far and will update this review if anything changes.","July 29, 2024"
3032,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Range Finder,4,"TLDR: An improvement in almost every possible way, and worth the upgrade (if the price isn't too much or a hurdle.)My original review of the Fold3 surmised that I loved the device, but would only recommend it to those who had a clear need for the interior ""main"" display; those who frequently watch movies/TV, play games, or (like me) like to read manga/manhua on the go. I think most of this is still true, but Samsung has made such significant changes in terms of ""usability"" that this is now a much easier recommendation, to even those who may only use the main display once or twice a day at most, possibly only a few times a week. The biggest change is how one-hand-friendly the device has become; cutting the weight by 12% and thinning the bezels down to the point that the outer screen just feels like a regular (albeit thinner) phone. It used to be I would try and use the outer display with one hand, but would often use two because the heft left me feeling a bit insecure (just physically, emotionally that's always been true.) This is now a thing of the past being lighter than ever, but also the hinge now has a matte texture instead of glossy; a small change that gives my fingers a better feel they have total control over the device as I grip it, to the point that I don't think I'll be putting a case on it (something I tried on the 3, but got tired of after a while.) The interior display is the same size it has been, but now that the screen-to-body ratio is tighter with smaller bezels, the whole device has become tangibly smaller, making ""pocketability"" so much easier. Which is also nice with its improved ""flatness"" when folded, as I have noticed less dust getting into the crease as compared to my 3.But there are still a couple weird things to note; the camera, and the phone's ""sharpness."" The phone overall has become thinner and folds slimmer, but the camera bezels are so much larger/more pronounced that the phone is still technically the same thickness. Its like the phone phone was shaved down around the camera, and they forgot to go back and finish. This isn't a huge issue, but you definitely notice is when you pick it up/grab it in your pocket. Speaking of grabbing it, if you have incredibly soft hands watch out, you might cut yourself on these edges. Yes that's a joke, but it doesn't change just how angular this phone feels. I guess 90° angles are ""in""? The phone looks very nice with its clean angled edges, but in practice I'd be lying if I said I never got tired of holding this phone for extended periods of time (something that while writing, I realized does mean I should make this a 4/5 rating.) This feels like a case of ""form over function,"" which is something I've long hated because if you make something more unpleasant to use just to look better, that to me is a tradeoff not worth making.But the main question will always be: How long will the folding screen last? As seen, my Fold3 interior display did get small hairline fractures all along the hinge after being folded and unfolded so many times. Thing is, they didn't start until about 1.5 years into use, and as long as whatever I was viewing wasn't a purely white screen, they were easily missed unless laser-focused on. Hopefully with development this newest version will last longer than ever, but I will update this as soon as it starts to degrade. So if you're thinking about upgrading from a couple generations ago I do think this is a vastly improved device, and would recommend it. If you're looking to get into the ""foldable"" market I think this is a great entry point, and even if you don't fall in love with the interior display, the outer one is so good you may not even care, especially now that the phone folds almost perfectly flat with those thinner bezels. This continues to be an incredible device for people like me who used to carry a tablet for movies and reading, and will continue to be my go-to device until someone makes a phone that unfolds even larger (I miss my 10in tablet screen.) If it wasn't for the squared-off edges I'd feel completely safe giving this a perfect 5/5, but it is still a very recommendable device at a 4/5, since I'd give it a 4.5/5 if I could.","August 2, 2024"
3033,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Mike,5,"This is the new Galaxy Z Fold 6 phone. The base model with 256GB of storage, 12GB RAM, and in silver finish. The phone operates on latest OneUI 6.1, Android 14. This phone has Samsung's 'AI' features. The battery is 4400mAh.In hindsight, I would have preferred the 512GB version, for the extra storage...which is currently selling for less.The initial impressions of the new model Z Fold 6 is WOW! It's pretty fast, the multiple screens are great, and I was planning to get a tablet but no longer need to thanks to the size of the folder. I'm still setting up the phone's configuration, and service. So, I will have updates as they materialize. I will be testing with eSIM and standard SIM. And hotspot WiFi operations. As a photographer, I'm excited with the powerful photo camera features of this model.The form factor is excellent. How thin it is folded is impressive. The hinge is much improved to be more rigid and strong. But a protective case must be acquired for it.  The next gen Z Fold 6 is a recommend and thumbs up! But go for the 512GB model.","August 20, 2024"
3034,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Sofia,5,"The Galaxy Z Fold6 is a game-changer. The moment you unfold that massive screen, it's like discovering a whole new world of possibilities. It's like having a mini-tablet in your hand. Watching movies or playing games on it is a totally different experience. The display is absolutely stunning, with vibrant colors and incredible detail. It also feels a lot more durable than I had expected in a folding screen (although I'd still be extremely cautious and considering a case!)All of the cameras are top-notch, capturing every moment in stunning clarity even at high speeds or dim lighting.I'm enjoying the new ""circle it"" feature too, though I bet we'll see that on other less expensive phones soon enough (as we are seeing with Gemini becoming more ubiquitous across Androids).It's a premium device, though, and the price reflects that. It's a lot to swallow, even for someone who likes their gadgets. You really gotta decide if the extra features are worth the extra cash.","August 9, 2024"

The continued lack of a folding phone with a large screen in Apple's lineup caused me to look elsewhere. Discovering and ultimately picking up this Galaxy Z Fold 6 has been lifechanging. I feel like it's the first time where I feel like I am actually using a piece of tech that has truly jumped a huge step into the future. Rather than the more typical incremental updates involving the camera & processor, this whole phone is simply a monumental leap forward in the world of smartphone technology. Aside from some slight worries about the long-term durability of the folding screen and hinge, I love this Samsung phone! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","August 3, 2024"
3037,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Narine,5,"This product is a game-changer! The large screen and foldable design make it perfect for multitasking and taking screenshots. The camera quality is stunning, and the AI features are impressive. However, battery life is a bit of a concern, and some apps still have issues with display ratios. Overall, it's a great device that's perfect for anyone looking for a powerful and innovative phone.","August 26, 2024"
3038,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,StanfordBear,5,"I want to start by saying I haven’t had a Samsung phone since the very first Galaxy Note in 2011.  I switched to iPhone and never went back.  However, after hearing all the hype about the Z fold, I wanted to give it a try.  My review will compare my current iPhone 15 pro to the Z fold 6Overall Impression: Z fold 6 is a clear winnerThe Z fold connects to WiFi much faster, pulls higher down speeds and maintains a steadier connectionThe Z fold offers a better gaming experience on the goThe Z fold is a little bulkier, however not as much as you would think for a phone that is also a tabletThe iPhone does offer a bit smoother of a transition between appsGetting used to the switch has taken some time.  Adding a case to the Z Fold does make it a bit bulkier than it already is, but with the price, I wouldn’t chance not having a case.The phone lacks a storage spot for an S pen so you will need a case if you want to use the S pen with the Fold 6.Overall, I am glad I switched and can’t wait to see what else this phone can offer","July 25, 2024"
3039,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,StanfordBear,5,"First of all this isn't a great phone for everyone. If you find yourself already using multiple apps on the screen at the same time then you're going to LOVE the multi apps features. I use multiple PDFs and emails on the screen at once, and love how much more productive I'm able to be while on one device. It kinda becomes a mobile work station for me. I can't speak about durability yet, but the build quality seems solid! Everything is aligned perfectly on mine, I know others have had some quality issues so far though. Battery is lasting about 8 hours using the main screen during sunny parts of the day, on 5G, and downloading stuff so pretty much max usage. Temperature on mine stays really cool. Definitely recommend this if you are a phone power user, but if you don't do lots from your phone you won't find it's abilities very useful. The crease is barely noticable when open.","July 28, 2024"
3040,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Madison S Straus,5,"This is an awesome phone. It has a great camera and form factor, I love the huge screen when it is open. The phone is bright and readable when unfolded and while folded still easily fits into my pocket. The battery is amazing if you don't use the big screen as often as the regularly sized screen, but it does have a notable impact on the battery if you use it unfolded a lot. Even so there is clearly a serious battery in this thing, it isn't a problem. I went from a Samsung Flip to this and it has been a great upgrade. It is really nice for showing others things like maps or video. I have really enjoyed this phone so far.","August 17, 2024"
3041,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,JCTexas,5,"Love this phone! Amazing sleek design, elegant, very lightweight and durable. Pretty easy to use and great performance. The camera takes exceptional photos. The inner display is gorgeous and the crease is barely visible to not visible at all when viewing a show or playing games. Exellent battery life! I have been able to go up to 24 hours without charging my battery with medium use. No issues with wi-fi, hotspot, mobile data, etc. Overall best Fold device currently on the market.

3046,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,S Davis,2,"Beautiful phone.  Beautiful screen despite the crease in the middle.But, you need to sign in to Samsung to get all the benefits.  In my case there was an account with my email, and someone else's name, phone and device.  I've never made a Samsung account.  Samsung makes no attempt to verify the email, and in this case it appears the email was never verified.  Samsung accounts will not help.  They won't verify the email, or look into the account in anyway.  After hours on the phone with their account help I returned the phone.  Based solely on their customer service I have no desire to own any samsung product in the future.","August 27, 2024"

The video calls if they work have a noticeable 3 second delay on Google, rcs chat is auto forced if you don't check it upon first opening.This doesn't give you options it's shoves you into paths.I very much honestly wish I have just spent 100 bucks to replace my 22 with insurance.","August 24, 2024"
3048,Samsung Galaxy S21,Matthew,5,"Samsung hit the nail on the head with this one. This phone has everything I need and more. The camera is top notch. I find myself leaving my DSLR at home, unless for special occasions. The screen is super clear even in direct sunlight and collects very few fingerprints (its like sorcery). The screen refresh rate also lends itself well to make the phone feel snappy and smooth. It's honestly heaven in my hands. The fast charging is a must, but fast wireless charging is even better. In glass finger print sensor is fast and accurate, you just have to get used to where it is (way better than face ID. However, the battery life is a little short (for heavy loads), but fast charging more for makes up for it. I considered getting the Ultra, but this phone exceeded my expectations in every way. The law of diminishing returns plagues the Ultra waaay too much. Take it from a person who values fast, robust, and cutting-edge tech that the S21 5G will not leave you short handed at nearly half price. It's not the cheaper option, it's the smarter one.","May 23, 2021"
3049,Samsung Galaxy S21,kjenkiwi,5,"After a bit of researching for a phone and what I want to use it for, I decided to go with the Galaxy S21. It's on the higher specs for phone capabilities so if you want the basic functionality of a phone then this is not for you.The phone is very responsive along with the 5G capabilities. I really only bought this phone for the use of Dex. Everything else is the icing on the cake.I've had this phone for a few days and I enjoy it. There's really not much I can say that is bad. The ONLY thing that's ""bad"" is they DO NOT include a wall charger.All in all, a great phone made by a great company.","September 24, 2021"

Night mode is great.Battery life is OK.Screen is great, even in the sun.The handset is light!Worst part is Samsung launcher (home screen app) since it doesn't let scroll down on app-drawer, and instead you have to go left-right browsing pages.

And, of course, the photos are so much better than my poor S-6.I made this move because the S-6 is the last phone Samsung will update.  It won't belong before that stops.

3055,Samsung Galaxy S21,PCH,1,"This was hands down the worst phone I have ever purchased. I have been a Samsung user for years and loved every phone from galaxy s4 through to my previous galaxy note 8.  The S21 was very sluggish with every action. It was as if it disconnected constantly from celluar and wifi and you had to wait 20 seconds or more for it to 'wake up' to do anything.  Within weeks it began to malfunction and freeze up. I constantly kept having to restart in safe mode. I eventually had to erase all data and ultimately attempt several factory resets. After several tech calls with amazon repeating the same troubleshooting steps, the last resort was to take it to an authorized repair service 30 miles away from me. However after working with the repair service they said it likely needed the mother board replaced. The Amazon customer service said it was clear it was faulty and to return it...I would be fully refunded and then I could buy it again. Well they refunded me $100 less than I paid without explanation. When I inquired they claimed it had been returned outside the 30 day window and this was a restock fee. I am now protesting this as I spent hours and weeks trying to get the phone to work before returning it. Trust me....this phone has major glitch issues. I also advise you save your money and sanity and NEVER buy a high end product from AMAZON.  I can accept that sometimes a product just is faulty but this issue was amplified by the Amazon customer service methods and refund policies. The headache and hassle I've been through has been exhausting. If you do order from them I suggest you save copies of the order details page and all chat history if you ever want your money back.  I've asked my issue be escalted to a manager but in the meant time because of this fiasco I have had to buy a lesser phone as I'm out $100 not to mention the case, pop socket and screen protector i got for the S21 that is wasted now! :(","July 14, 2021"
3056,Samsung Galaxy S21,mitzi brehm,3,"I was excited to jump from my S10e to the S21 5G.. until I actually did it.Transferring my backup to the S21 went smoothly, but then I realized they did away with a microSD slot. Glad I grabbed the 256gb I guess, but with no expansion storage option, will it make my new phone obsolete faster?Next, I need to set up my fingerprint scanner. Always traveling & on the go, slightly running my finger along the power button on my S10e cut down on time & effort swiping or entering a pin or pattern. Every app used my fingerprint to log in, unlocking the screen was a breeze... not anymore. Instead of the first try unlocking the phone, it sometimes takes multiple attempts. Prompting to ""press harder"" or ""cover the entire sensor"". The sensor is built into the lower portion of the screen. No easy way to gauge that your thumb is centered on it each time. I found it so frustrating I resorted to face recognition & a pin lock & swipe so essentially downgrading the convenience. I have since retried after a software update and adding a fingerprint sensor compatible screen protector and its 100% unusable now.Battery life is better than my 3 year old S10e, but not by a drastic amount.Camera function & quality is overhyped. I can get a wider shot on the S21 and nice HDR images, but I strongly feel anything in low light is much more grainy than my S10e was. I feel they barely upgraded the image sensor on the S21 to save on costs. This is also apparent with the phone pretty much only including the phone in the box. No charger, screen protector, or form of headphones as previous flagship S series phones included.My banking app does not work on the S21. It says I have an autoclicker app installed and closes. Bank claims it's the new phone, Samsung claims it's the banking app. Works on my S10e, reset the S21 to default and installed just my banking app..still doesn't work.Performance-wise I'm not able to see a difference with any of the apps or games I've used on both phones. Maybe that will be more apparent in the future as processing demands increase across apps.Do I regret my purchase? Yes. But if you are coming from any phone that is less than an S9 you'll probably see a noticeable upgrade. S21 is a misleading name, I'd consider it more of an S10.5 5G if anything.. and that's being nice about it.","July 15, 2021"
3057,Samsung Galaxy S21,Matthew,4,"The  phone itself is nice. However, I did NOT receive the items promised in the description by Amazon. I was told that included was a charger, a charging cable, and some adapter. What I got was a c to c cable... which is useless to me. NO charger, NO cables, nothing. I had to  go out anf buy this stuff today. An added expense which brought my total cost to about a 1000 for this phone. For that much money, I could really upgraded and probably got a charger, cable  AND a case. Not happy. I'll find someone to complain to.UPDATE:I did call, well, text first, but I finally got a hold of someone and they hooked me up with a partial refund to buy a nice charger with a cable. It's still a lot of phone but really it's pretty bitchen.Very happy with item.","April 11, 2021"

3060,Samsung Galaxy S21,Jackie,2,"No sd slot, memory is set in stone, with a large part of it unavailable due to built in stuff, including all non-removeable Bixby that you cannot disable invasive permissions on.  Not very good value for me.  Has no headphone jack for output to car stereo, composing hardware, amps, etc. For 800 bucks you'd expect at least that.  Also, the camera is CRAP, sharpness is not there, even on highest resolution.  It's advertised as wonderful, but it's hype. Big disappointment, definitely bad in low light or evening, colors are way off, sunsets look like a water color or bad editing. Extremely disappointed even in good light. Software doesn't seem to use the lens capabilities, which is important to me as I was going to use it for videography apps on the go.  Makes my videos look second rate.  Don't spend money on this, save a few hundred more and get a true higher quality phone, or go with a cheaper Samsung, this isn't that much better to justify price difference.","May 15, 2023"
3061,Samsung Galaxy S21,Jackie,1,Update 2: I love this phone!! Huge upgrade from my Galaxy A6. The setup process was a nightmare but it finally works. You most likely have to go to your carrier and pay an activation fee to use it like I did because simply putting my Sim card in did not work. I am giving 5 stars for the phone but I would give 0 stars for how this whole process wentUpdate: Amazon sent a replacement phone the next day and it works! The graphics are great! Games run a lot smoother and it charges super fast. Keep in mind that this is my first S series phone so I am amazed to be able to run more than 2 apps without my phone crashing. New problem: My SIM card doesn't work. I am taking it to MetroPCS to see if I can get help. This whole process has been difficult. I was really hoping to just pop the SIM in and start using right away. Disappointing.I was super excited to get this phone because I have never had an S series Galaxy phone before. When I opened the box it would not turn on. It didn't come with a charger and I did not own one so I had to wait for one to arrive in the mail because no store had them in stock near me. Finally plugged it in and nothing happens. Even the phone store I took it to couldn't figure it out. Amazon is sending me a replacement and I'll update my review once I actually get to use the phone. I am very shocked and disappointed in Samsung. I seem to be the only one with the problem of recieving a dead phone. Hopefully the replacement will work.Update 3: This model sucks.

For gaming and battery, I think iPhone12 pro is better but this is entry model of s series so I think it's quite good!

I can start typing must and it will come out MST or something (just an example). I wanted the phone mostly for the camera but the level of aggravation isn't worth it!  The camera isn't as great as I thought it would be. I waited to long to activate it so I didn't know all of this until it was too late to return it.  When I did a search on the problems, it seems a lot of people have the same issues. I didn't rate the facial recognition because I haven't used it nor tried it.","August 29, 2021"

3144,Samsung Galaxy XCover,T L Fulton,5,"I've been going through a lot of phones lately. I live a rugged lifestyle: construction, farming, hunting, camping... I need a phone that can take a tumble or two. The last phone I had like that was a Samsung J7, a strong phone that lasted a long time, but is out dated because it only has 16 gig ROM—towards the end I was switching between apps by uninstalling one and reinstalling the other. This phone has 64, which is plenty for me, since I found the SD slot—the two SIM bays threw me off for a minute, those little things can be tough to see: the SD slot is on top of SIM 1, which is the SIM slot you want to use for the States.Anyway, ever since they started putting the fingerprint scanner under the screen, it seems the screen has become super fragile, and now when you break it, it doesn't just crack and you can still use it, it completely craps out and your phone is now useless. Mind you, every phone I purchase is bought with tempered glass screen protectors at the same time, which is installed immediately upon removing the phone from its packaging, the moment the protective film is removed from the screen a tempered glass screen cover is the next thing to touch it. The last time I didn't have the screen protector when the phone arrived, I left the protective film on the phone and used it like that until the protectors arrived. My old J7 would look a total shattered mess, and I'd peel off the screen protector and it'd look like a bran new phone underneath, and a new protector would be put right back on. I swore by them, but they don't protect the new phones like they did my J7, and I really think it's the stuff they put behind the screen now.This is probably why this phone has the fingerprint scanner on a side button, which I love, because it's way more accurate (probably due to the glass shields), and because it's more accessible: I can reach it with my left middle finger if I'm holding it in my left hand, or with my right thumb if I'm holding it in my right. The on screen readers often took me two hands to operate, this one I can easily work with one, making this phone so much easier for me to get into.Also, I love the two added programmable buttons, a great feature to have for people who frequently wear gloves, you can program these buttons for easy access to things like your phone dialer or camera, even if your phone is still locked, if you choose that option.Android 10 is incredibly customizable and full of features, and this is a standard Samsung phone in that it gives you full access to these features and runs the operating system well. I told you I've broken a lot of phones lately, some phones I can compare this to are the Samsung A20 and A51, and moto z4. The A20 had a power port failure on like day two, the rest were all broken screens. Those phones I think are designed more for office type workers or those in medical field and such, I think. They have a nice sleek design and their screens go to the edge of the phone or even wrap around. This phone's screen doesn't go to the edge, and is slightly recessed, which makes me feel it's better protected from a fall on its face. This makes the screen protector fit flush in the recess, but I'm disappointed that it does not fit snug. That's a separate review for the screen protector, I don't fault the phone for that. This phone is a little bit bulkier (thicker) and I suppose heavier than those sleeker designs, but I'm more comfortable with it in my hands and it definitely feels sturdier.I loved removing the cover and seeing the battery! I've missed being able to change batteries when I go on a long trip into the woods for a campout, and want to take photos or use Google Earth, or track a hike... I hope to be able to purchase a backup soon.It would be nice to have a phone again that outlasts it's specs. If this phone holds up for me as well as the J7 did, I'll be happy. If not, I will update my review.","October 30, 2020"
3145,Samsung Galaxy XCover,T Kebbe,5,"Yada yada yada, this phone, that phone, all kinds of phones everywhere you turn - you get so bombarded with cell phone ads and commercials it becomes obnoxious. What sold me on this phone is the incredibly easy to remove / replace battery which you just can't find much of anymore. All of these new phones do not particularly serviceable batteries, so what happens after a 1000 charge cycles? If you want to keep a phone for years to come, this is it. When they say BEAST, it truly is in everyway. While it is not a slim small phone that you could forget in your pants pocket and accidentally end up in the washing machine, it is not overbearingly large or heavy. This IS definitely a commercial heavy duty grade phone. I put what I considered to be an enormous 256gb micro SD card in it, so along with the 60GB it already has built into it, it now has more space available in it than my laptop PC does. Yes, there are no particular instructions that come with this phone, but it is truly rather intuitive to learn to use. Battery life has been amazing. Reception has been amazing, even in the metal building I work in that is usually dicey for reception at best under any carrier. There is such a dramatic leap in technology with this phone that I am actually stunned - Android 10 is very well done. It is not listed as 5G, but I wouldn't be one bit surprised if it gets a software update at some point and magically meets the new mark. As it is, it downloads things and plays HD videos so quickly and smoothly that I wouldn't likely even be able to tell the difference if it switched to 5G.So I receive the phone, a little anxious about whether I can just swap in my Verizon SIM card out of my old phone and go. Ooops... Apparently SIM cards got smaller when I wasn't looking - DOH! NANO SIM cards now? Ok, so I have apparently been living under a rock. My older SIM was too big to fit. I hopped online and researched it, and what do you know, you can actually see a ton of online tutorials as to how to simply trim your older / larger SIM card down to the new NANO size - interesting. I ordered a new replacement NANO SIM from Verizon at no charge, but it will take a few days to get here. Anxious to try this bad boy phone out, I nervously trimmed my SIM card down with scissors, sanded the plastic side down a bit, and popped it right in. Not sure if I had possibly wrecked the SIM card, and also not sure if Verizon would accept the phone without a fight, I powered it up, went through the initial on screen set up prompts, and BAM - up and running perfectly (standard personal Verizon account - not commercial or prepaid). I transferred all of my data from my old phone to the new phone using the Wondershare Mobile Trans software I have installed on my PC, and everything transferred over perfectly - hooray!Now what they aren't advertising much just yet is that this phone has a dual sim card capability - wow. I haven't tested it yet, but am going to yank the SIM card out of my wife's Verizon phone and pop it into the the slot labeled ""SIM 2"". There was some mention that this feature is coming soon via a software update, but who knows - maybe that day has already come? I am VERY curious to see what it does with two SIM cards in it, speculating that it will act like a ""Line 1 or Line 2"" phone. WAAAAAAAY back in the early days, I had a Sprint phone that ran two lines. I ran a business line and also a personal line on that phone - I sure have missed that capability since then. If this works and I have two lines, I may try one of those companies like Cricket to provide a low cost second line. Again, I haven't tested this yet, but I'll bet you it works, which will tickle me silly for my business and personal usages.It has only been a few days now, but I am beyond tickled with this phone. I took a bit of a gamble on it, seeing some reviews that ranged from soup to nuts. The outcome? Tickled silly :)  BIG SCREEN, ultra fast processor, more capabilities than I ever imagined (still finding more and more cool features as I continue to use it further), outstanding battery life, incredible HD audio clarity on the phone (bizarre how clear actually), phenomenal camera and video with all kinds of different possible settings, and on and on and on. Rated for being immersed in water up to five feet for thirty minutes??? Military grade drop tested with a Gorilla glass screen?Can you tell how tickled I am with this phone? And to think I was just sold on the fact that you could pop in a spare fresh battery in ten seconds flat - this is an AMAZING SUPER PHONE PEOPLE !!!  I occasionally get something that under promises and over delivers - rare, but it happens. This is most definitely one of the best purchases I have made in years - SERIOUSLY  :)  :)  :)","April 9, 2021"
3146,Samsung Galaxy XCover,T L Fulton,1,"I am an android phone user and have been using Samsung galaxy phones for the past decade. I started off with the Galaxy S3 moving to Galaxy S6, the Galaxy S8 Active ( my favorite so far) to the Galaxy Xcover Pro. I had to replace my S8 Active with a Xcover pro, because the S8 phone would not charge anymore in any way, and the Xcover pro was the closest match, even though it doesn't come close to the Galaxy S8 Active. Don't even know why Samsung has discontinued it.I purchased my Galaxy pro around a month ago on Amazon, which provided a 30 day return policy, however around 3 weeks ago, I started experiencing problems with my phone screen, the phone started restarting on its own, and I started seeing some white lines on my screen. Did not give it too much attention as I was very busy at work, and did not have any time to attend this issue.A couple days ago, the screen colors started fading, and the screen started acting up even more, tried calling samsung customer service yesterday but the hold times were over 2 hours, ended up giving up. This morning, I woke up to find the screen almost 90% faded, and the touch keys were not working, I was unable to use the phone at this point.I decided to take the phone to the nearest samsung electronics service center in Maywood NJ. The manager over there was very friendly, accepted to service the phone even though I had no appointment. Once I showed her the model, she told me that she wasnt sure if this model was serviced at this location, but still showed it to the Tech which then confirmed that there are no spare part available for this phone. I was then given the option to ship the phone to samsung and get it fixed under warranty, which would leave me without a phone for 7 business days!!! and that was my only option since I have no other phone to use ( Galaxy S8 wont charge). I refused and was then advised to call 1-800-SAMSUNGThis is when it gets even better, the service rep who picked up the phone was making it look like I was making this story up, and was trying to convince me that there was never a screen issue with this phone, and that this is the first time he hears this, I then asked to speak with a supervisor, which told me the same thing and was then transferred to case management. After two hours on the phone and 1 hour driving to get in and back from the service center, case management advised me to call ""U break it we fix it"" which is the Authorised repair facility for Samsung as mentioned by case management. I call their location in Westwood, and guess what?? They do not have any spare parts and I was then referred to the Service Center in Maywood that handles uncommon phones like mine. SO guess what, 3 hours later back to square one, I took a day off to resolve this issue.Bottom line is Samsung customer service is the worst!!! Will be duping this piece of trash in the garbage, and will purchase another phone with any other manufacturer that has an android platform.Thank you SAMSUNG","September 23, 2020"

As someone who went from a thick rugged phone to this lighter weight but rugged phone, you want extra protection. I still use and abuse the other rugged phone, but I have found out very quickly that it wasn't as waterproof as the company claimed it be. (Don't get the Ulefone Armor 7, water will get in through the SIM card port even though it has a rubber gasket on it.)Still very strong on the gaming aspect having weird results from game to game. Even with the device up to date on updates, it still plays weird with some or runs smoothly on others. Your mileage will vary.Speakers... Still meh and disappointed about. Invest in wired earbuds (YES, it has a 3.5mm jack) or bluetooth ones.Bluetooth connects flawlessly, for me. No issues with connecting to numerous bluetooth earbuds, speakers, and car audio systems I've tested/daily use.Original:It's been since the Samsung Galaxy S5 that I've had a phone with a removable back and battery. Wow!Although it's IP68 rated, I'd still get a case and screen protector for this phone. As you should for most phones.I am very nit picky with phones. Over the past 3 years, I have gone through (either daily driven, tested and returned, or daily driven and broken) 7 Android phones and 1 Apple device (yuck BTW). I can say that I'm glad to be back with Samsung Galaxy line up, but there could be better options out there for the features I care about - especially the IP68 or IP69K dust and water resistant ratings.For what it's worth and in my tests/everyday use, this isn't a beefy rugged phone. However, it is an average joe type of rugged phone. (I define ""average joe"" as someone who daily drives this phone, keeps it turned on for months at a time unless they *somehow* install updates in that ""once in a solar eclipse"" moments, plays casual games or even as far as Pokemon Go, charges their phone without a care in the world, and rarely drops their phone but still want that sense of security it's not going to shatter on them if they drop it)Pros:+IP68 Rating. I love me a water resistant phone that I can take to the pool with me or get a bit wet in the rain.+Removable battery. I miss it. I still love it. If it happens to get a bit wet, do a unsafe shutdown by removing the battery. Put the phone in some moisture absorbing material or apparatus and check on it in 12-24hrs. (Not rice because the broken rice grains can get into spots it shouldn't)+Dual SIM and still have the microSD card? Yes please! Look... most phones have the dual SIM trays with one of the SIMs being a microSD card/SIM slot. Once you put a microSD card in, you only have 1 SIM slot. I hated that. But with this, you can have both SIM slots taken and still have the ability to put in a microSD card! (Nano SIMs are accepted on both SIM slots)+Speaking of Dual SIMs... Verizon and AT&T only, but it's great. I hate T-Mobile anyways. Verizon, minus their customer service and online registration, has been great. So when a phone has full Verizon capability, I'm in.+Cameras are decent. I like it, but I've had better phone cameras. Main cameras (25MP main, f/1.7, 26mm (wide), PDAF and 8MP wide, f/2.2, 123˚ (ultrawide), 1/4.0"", 1.12µm) are ok. I wouldn't use the 8MP wide for anything other than Panoramic photos. Selfie camera (13MP, f/2.0, (wide), 1/3.1"", 1.12µm) is good. I still look ugly, so there's that.Cons:-Playing games can be challenging. Some games like Shop Titans lag while Pokemon Go can run smoothly. Not sure why. Could be the ARM Mali-G72 MP3 GPU - which is integrated into the Exynos 9611 CPU. I've seen mixed reviews on the Exynos 9611 CPU. So your mileage can vary.-Single loudspeaker that isn't loud enough. I find myself having to put the phone closer to my ear, if I were to put my phone on speaker while I talk to someone. For music, it sounds more mono than a single speaker stereo output. Very disappointing.-Android 11... I am ok with it, but I hate it at the same time. It's got dark mode, which is nice. But Secure Folder isn't the best idea for locking apps. Android 9 had it better where you can lock apps with a code or password without having to sign into your profiles again. But it is easier to access your apps via the app drawer, unlike Android 10.-1 too many buttons for the same functions. There are 2 function keys, along with your fingerprint/lock button and 2 volume control buttons. The top key, which in default turned on your flashlight with 1 press. And the left side key, which turned on Bixby by default. I've gotten used to a phone where their function key was customizable for screenshots, without having to press the traditional Volume Down + Lock Button. So, it's disappointing that such function isn't accessible on the function keys. You can change the function keys to other actions like turning on and off a Flashlight, or launching your Settings, or anything app based. So you're not stuck with the defaults of Bixby and flashlight only.-Speaking of Bixby... I'm not a fan. I'm not a fan of Google Assistant either. But I would rather use Google and Bixby. I'm not sure if they'll upgrade to Samsung Sam at this point.","June 22, 2021"
3148,Samsung Galaxy XCover,T Kebbe,5,"I love my LG G5 so much I bought more than 15 of it for my family and relatives, and 1 as a back up for myself, but unfortunately both died... one wouldn't turn on again one day and the other takes too much effort to repair. I have been eyeing this phone from Samsung since May 2020, but the only reason why I did not get it sooner was because the spare battery was nowhere to be found in the states. WTH Samsung? I was ready to upgrade the whole family to this phone, but you've let us down - you've let a lot of folks down.So why then the 5 stars? Read on....Going from the LG G5 to this phone was smooth. Only a few things that bothered me. So lets go over the cons first:- No spare battery available in th US. Enough said.- Volume is lower than any other phone I've used. I've disabled the volume limiter, but the volume on max settings for this phone including for its loudspeaker is still too low. For a phone marketed for industrial use, the audio quality should atleast be up to par with other phones. Microphone is clear and crisp, but what good is it if you can't really hear the other person on the line while being in an industrial environment? Regular users should be okay with the volume.- The fingerprint reader/power button is on the right near the volume buttons and is flushed with the side making hard to feel for  whereas the G5 has it slightly raised and it is the only button on the back...so it was easier to feel for. Would really rather have the ""XCover"" button as the power/fingerprint button.- Default button and screen page layout for this phone is messy and frustrating to navigate. It will require some fiddling to get a better end result. Can be much easier to use than the G5. My suggestion...download a button remapper app. It will make your life much easier. Let's just hope Samsung doesn't decide to disable the 3rd party button remapper as their button remapper is extremely limited, junk.- No IR blaster. Who uses it these days? I do, and quite often. Really miss this option...but then again...it's just me.Pros:- Long battery life. I use my phone heavily... to give you an idea...I go through at least 3 to 4 G5 batteries a day. With this phone from morning until night ...I still have about 20% left to go. This is the reason why I am not knocking off a star for the spare battery issue - there's  really no need to change battery. However, like all batteries, their charge cycles diminishes, and also because there will be time when I am out for days without a charger. Therefore, I still would like to see Samsung live up to its promises.- Feels good on the hand. Feels solid... not slipper...no fingerprints all over the phone. Looks clean - all the time.- Top button by default is a flashlight on/off. You can change the settings to even have it accessible even when the phone is locked. This is definitely one of my favorite feature for this phone. Ofcourse you can also remap it to other things too if you so choose. Same with the left ""Xcover"" button.- Removable battery and is waterproof? As long as you dont drop it deep into a lake...I was already sold on the removable battery.- Better cameras. The cameras setup is similar to what you get with the G5: Main camera, wide camera, and selfie...just better quality.- Charges quickly. For a battery this size...it completes its charge almost at the same time as the LG G5.Other things to consider:- May be on the heavier side. I don't mind this at all, but it is heavier than the G5. Just something you might want to note.Conclusion: it is an upgrade from the LG G5. And for the price, it definitely deserves a 4.5 five star rating. However, I can't give half a star, so I'll give it a 5 star and hope that Samsung will finally make available the spare battery plus charging cradle.","December 15, 2020"
3149,Samsung Galaxy XCover,MRandomInterviews,2,"It took two phones ( the first shipped with no battery, shame on Samsung ) but once I had it and got it working, it's fine. Nice large and clear screen, quick fingerprint scanner and face recognition, battery lasts reasonably well. I really don't need a ""superthin"" expensive super phone and this works well and has features I like, like ruggedized, removable battery and dual sim ( once Samsung gets the software done to activate that ). This is NOT 5G capable but those networks are still coming in, will take awhile, and the 4G LTE works fine anyway.Good luck finding a spare battery. Nothing on Amazon or that other large Internet vendor. Good luck finding a dedicated charger for the battery outside of the phone. There are some ""universal"" chargers on Amazon and elsewhere but I returned the one I ordered, wouldn't work even following maker's specific instructions for XCover Pro battery. Cheaply made junk IMHO.So where is Samsung? Hey, I want to spend more money with you! Gone missing. This phone has been selling retail since early this year. But, nothing on their web site(s) for extra battery or dedicated charger. I called their service line, 1-800-SAMSUNG this morning ( Saturday ). That rep referred me to ""sales"". That was a crummy phone connection to an ESL person obviously overseas. After she did much looking and off line research, that rep said I need to talk to ""parts"" which isn't open weekends ( ! ). She said she will send me an e-mail number with the ""parts"" contact information for next week. I hope so but so far since the call, no e-mail yet.It's no bueno that I can't use one of the best features of this phone, swapable battery. Even more so that Samsung has such weak support for their otherwise nice product.","August 1, 2020"
3150,Samsung Galaxy XCover,Weirdest,3,"I bought this phone for many of the reasons B. Rodgers cited in his thorough review. The phone is bigger and much heavier than what I expected [ UPDATE: but I got used to the bigger size and weight].Flagship phones are designed for obsolescence and cost twice as much. They have sealed-in batteries that typically fail after 2 years, and usually only promise 1-2 years of security updates. Since the Xcover Pro has Android 10 from the factory, it reportedly can support more thorough or lasting updates than Android 9 phones. The Xcover Pro guarantees 3-4 years of security updates, and has a 24-month warranty, whereas most phones offer only 12 month warranties and maybe 1 OS update.The battery can be swapped out before a new work shift, and swapped out at the end of its useful life, using only our bare hands. This phone is rugged, water resistant, and has good cameras; other phones with removable batteries have no water-resistance, low-end processors, and low-end cameras. I don't want to contribute to electronic waste, so I chose a phone that is designed to last. The ultra-wide-angle camera seems to cover about 135 degrees, so you can stand in a room corner and fit the whole room into the frame.It has a left-side button that can be assigned to any two apps via a long press or short press, and a top button that can be assigned to launch any two apps. The right-side power button can also be assigned, and I don't have to lift the phone off the desk to use the fingerprint reader that is built into the right-side power button.* Dictation without the cloudThis phone can convert speech to text internally, without sending your voice to the cloud. I confirmed this by dictating text into apps while holding the right-side button, even when I had the phone in airplane mode.* Wi-Fi callingI need Wi-Fi calling so I can place and receive calls without paying exorbitant roaming fees when I travel, while using my regular phone number. Although Samsung reassured me that all their phones including this one support WI-Fi calling, after purchase Samsung support told me that Wi-Fi calling requires cell-carrier bloatware baked into the phone's firmware. Consequently, if you want this phone to have Wi-Fi calling, the only option is to get a carrier version. In the US it is only Verizon, so you will have to put up with the worst customer service I have experienced in years, or purchase the phone from Verizon then use it on another network.* Point Of Sale (POS) transactions:Samsung claims that this is the only phone with EMV Level-1 compatibility: ""You can now accept payments without the need for additional hardware. The Galaxy XCover Pro has EMV Level-1 that makes it mPOS-ready."" However, the Xcover Pro does NOT have MST (Magnetic Secure Transfer) hardware, and therefore does not support Samsung Pay for paying at point of sale (POS) locations.Samsung claims I can use Google Pay, but I have not tried that, as I do not want Google to log every transaction I make with my phone. Unlike other payment systems, Samsung Pay uses MST hardware on their most popular phones to make credit card transactions compatible with all POS magnetic strip readers.The phone does have NFC payment, which works only on POS systems that support NFC. So Ironically, the XCover Pro has more capabilities for accepting payments from other credit cards, but fewer capabilities for making payments with your own credit card due to lack of MST hardware.This unlocked Xcover Pro has powered down for no apparent reason, and self-reset numerous times. I don't know if that's due to any of my installed apps, though they were working fine on my older & slower Samsung phone. I'm returning this phone and trying my luck with the Verizon version because Wi-Fi calling is essential to me. The Verizon XCover Pro is not self-resetting, but I have not yet allowed it to install the latest OS update, so I don't know if that will cause the resets.*** UPDATE on 2020-07-25: ***I purchased the $500 Verizon XCover Pro with a $200 discount to be credited monthly over 24 months, and an additional $200 credit on my first Verizon bill for porting my phone number to a Verizon Enterprise account. Obtaining a new account from Verizon was so aggravating I'm not sure it will be worth the savings.1) As far as I know my Verizon XCover Pro has not self-reset. I've had it for almost two months. I suppose I should restart the phone.2) If anyone has conclusively been able to get this unlocked XCover Pro to work with Wi-Fi calling, please reply to this review and let us know. Samsung told me Wi-Fi calling is not possible on an unlocked phone.3) If you have been able to get this phone at a discount from Verizon on a personal account, let us know.4)  Unsurprisingly, Verizon's custom bloatware on the Verizon version of the XCover Pro disabled the built-in FM radio. Carriers do this to push us into their data plan. So no emergency radio reception for when the towers are down or out of reach, and no radio feed without a data plan on the Verizon version.5) The FM radio on this unlocked phone was not disabled. However, I could not get FM radio reception using  the NextRadio app (all I heard was noise) even though reception was great on my nearby Android tablet using the same wired earphones as an antenna. Does the FM radio work on your XCover Pro? You you can install the NextRadio app and use wired earphones as an antenna.","June 7, 2020"
3151,Samsung Galaxy XCover,Saulster,5,"I went from a S5 to a LG v20 to this phone. I've had it for about a day and this is the next generation phone for replacement battery users. This is a phone for everyone. I strongly believe it will become a best seller despite what the designers of the modern thin and flimsy phones want you to buy. Assuming I don't bust this phone it should last me 4+ years.This thing feels good in the hand. It's plastic/rubber material is welcome. I don't feel like it will slip out of my hand. I don't need a case! In the end this phone is smaller than my LG v20 with the smallest of cases on it.The software is okay. I'm not in love with what Samsung does but I've been able to make it more usable with some items in the play store (such as a brightness slider on the slide down menu). I turned off most of Samsung's stuff so it feels pretty simple. Not a lot of added apps. Some things you would expect aren't here but easily added (calculator, calendar and I'm sure some other basics I'm missing still).The screen is great. I was worried about sunlight with sun glasses on but it does just fine. However if you put the phone into landscape mode and are wearing polarized sun glasses - the screen is basically unusable.  Something due to the alignment of the pixels. So if you like to watch movies or play games with your sun glasses on don't get this phone. For me personally this is not a deal breaker one bit.When writing this on 6/9/2020 this phone doesn't quite feel finished. It's been a long time since I felt like an early adopter. The second SIM card isn't enabled yet. There is no way to purchase a second battery (however Samsung did above in the questions the product SKUs and a timeline when they will come out) and I find that odd as the first thing I want is a second battery and charger for it. TAKE MY MONEY. The walkie talkie feature sounds amazing but does not look supported yet and even when it is supported I'm not sure if I want to use MS teams. I wish it came with a minimal app to talk to other xcover pro's. I'd buy one for my wife instantly. With all of that said I've had no crashes or issues with getting anything to work.The camera is good and seems to be an upgrade from even my wife's S9+. I have not played around with the video a whole lot but it does seem to be fine, even if the app is too minimal for me. I really enjoy much higher FPS for certain types of recording and I will need to find another app for it.The physical side and top buttons are welcome as well as the headphone jack. It only comes with 1 speaker but it is loud and I'm fine with that. The phone works great with Samsung earbuds as you'd expect (then again...never know). Having external storage is fantastic also. I can keep hours of videos on this thing, which is something I find quite useful in my job.If you have a LG v20 or a S5 just get this phone. The price is right and we should be supporting a phone made for people who live in the real world. If you just busted your back glass or screen or have a big stupid looking case on your phone then get this one. It might last you years and years. Even when you upgrade from this in 2024 you can always slap a new battery and use it as a backup phone.","June 9, 2020"
3152,Samsung Galaxy XCover,BuyBye planet Earth,4,"Overall, a very solid phone. I was trying to decide between this and the ($200 more expensive) Cat S62 Pro, so I'll discuss pros and cons compared between the two. Spoiler alert: I finally decided on the CAT S62 Pro.Pros:-- Screen -- The screen on this phone is nice and responsive. It's the nicer of the two, overall. Crisp display, nice colors for the price point, clear letters.-- Battery -- I only used it off and on for a little bit, but the battery life was nice. The battery is actually replacable. That's one of the few phones on the market that does that. I really wanted to like this phone for that very reason.-- Protection -- Overall, the case design was very nice (it's supposed to be a rugged phone after all). I didn't test waterproofness since I wasn't sure if I wanted to keep the phone. The camera was recessed beneath the case cover, the edges around the screen were bossed to provide extra protection. That was actually better than the S62 whose camera wasn't recessed, but was in fact excessed.Personal Preferences:-- UI -- With that being said, the UI on this is a Samsung UI and it's not one that I'm as fond of as the S62 UI due to having come from an S41. It's a personal preference, so no knock against the phone. Basically, the back button and the window carousel button are swapped.-- OS and Preloads -- Oh, the S62 is a stripped down Android with two or three of its own apps. The Samsung has quite a few extra apps. Most of them are quite nice, but I don't need any of them, so they're bloatware to me: Bixby, Samsung App Store, and some other baked in features (e.g. the UI is built by Samsung, not a stock Google one, and Samsung has its accounts baked into the setting pages. The preloads may be a con to you, but it wasn't for me. It runs Android 10, which doesn't have all the new permissions junk that 11 has.-- Call Quality -- In my particular setup, call quality was decent, but not stellar. The S62 beat out the Samsung slightly. It could have been the party I was calling, or a host of other issues, so I didn't factor this into my overall rating.-- Settings -- The settings page wasn't intuitive for me (since it's Samsung's arrangement of the settings page), but I'm also used to a different setup.Cons:-- Camera -- The camera on this has a higher megapixel count, but the S62 actually had better shots with its 12MP camera. So this camera has larger photos with a slightly lower quality.-- Phone Back -- To access the battery, SIM card, and SD card, a cover on the back of the phone must be popped off. This is just a plastic panel, so I'm worried about the durability of the panel over time.Ultimately, I returned the XCover Pro in favor of the CAT S62 Pro, but it was close. The S62 has slightly better IP ratings, and a slightly better camera, oh and the FLIR sensor. In all fairness, as mentioned earlier, the S62 is nearly $200 more, though (which is roughly the cost of the FLIR sensor in it).","March 21, 2022"
3153,Samsung Galaxy XCover,RJW,4,"I bought this thinking it would be a nice upgrade as I'm a current verizon customer and none of their current offerings have a replaceable battery. This phone is advertised as compatible with verizon network but after 2 new sim cards, and 2 weeks with customer support of both Samsung and verizon, a supervisor from verizons customer support came back and said it's not compatible. So buyer beware, what is compatible is data streaming services. What is not compatible is calling and texting, as the only way to do that is through data streaming. So if you're setup with a phone number through volp and you're not planning to use 4g for calling or txting this is the phone for you.For details of my ordeal:I bought this without a sim card and went to a small wireless shop near me to get a new sim card. First person said, I can't register this sim card with your device, you'll need to contact customer support and have them mail you a new sim card. After calling customer support, they said you have to go to a verizon company store. Went to a verizon company store who did the check on the imei#, installed new sim card but when she tried to make a test phone call, it wouldn't connect. She goes, this phone isn't compatible, sorry, call the manufacturer. I left which was a big mistake because I should've rolled my service back to old phone since everything now authenticates through txt, including email and bank accounts. I wasn't connected to world and an Aunt reported me missing to police. Got resolved, but still stressed her out. Called Samsung and they said, it should work on verizon there's no additional settings needed, it's a network issue, call verizons customer support. So I did and customer support told me when they try to activate it it'll appear for a split second on their screen but doesn't connect. So she rolled back my service to old phone so I'm connected to world again and sent me a new sim card. Plan was to activate new sim card on old phone, and place in new phone. I get new sim card but old phone was too old and no longer compatible. So I called Verizon customer support again and went through 2 reps and a supervisor who finally told me this phone isn't compatible with verizons network.The phone itself is fast and responsive. Great look and still has a replaceable battery. But don't get this if you use cellular networks for calling and texting. Every single rep I talked too, both verizon and Samsung asked to verify compatibility with imei# and it always checked out. If this was to teach people to buy their phones directly from a carrier, f them.","November 10, 2021"
3154,Samsung Galaxy XCover,T L Fulton,4,"So got this phone as my old one of 6 yrs finally crapped out after going through a dozen replaceable batteries and after I could no longer delete enough carrier bloatware to stop the phone from bogging down - did I mention it was old? So because of my job I needed a phone that can be used for 18 to 24 hrs without a charge and that means a replaceable battery - also nice to have extra storage in the form of an SD card as it allows one to avoid prematurely clogging up the device memory with all those 2 thousand songs and photos.That pretty much limited my choices, buy an older phone model like the LG V20 which is old already, or buy a really old old model like the galaxy S5 like I just had - or buy the Samsung Galaxy xcover pro. So I got the xcover and got two extra batteries from England for 60 bucks delivered - they arrived in 3 days same day as the phone, (noice job there mates). Anyway getting the phone to work on Verizon (the only carrier that works reliably at my home) was an adventure. Couldn't swap the Sim card as the xcover takes a smaller one than the one in my old phone. Drove 30 miles to town to get a new Sim card - first place all out - drove 5 more miles to next place they had one. They put it in the phone activated it and started transfering data. Longer story short the new Sim was bad couldn't make or receive calls and once that was resolved still couldn't make calls until they found that the hd digital box had to be checked and activated on my Verizon account. After that it finally worked. So yeah, can't give it four stars as the phone came with no documentation - there is a manual online but you have to look for it - and it was real pain to get it to work - I certainly could not have done it on my own and was weirdly lucky to run into a computer/phone geek at the verizon store who took an hour to make it work, ""cause it should work.""Using the phone is fine - a little bigger than I'm used to but seems like most of the phones are all huge now-a-days. Love the replaceable batteries a real life and anxiety saver. Like the fast charge. Phone seems to work fast enough. Love the SD card just drop all the crap right on it. Can't speak to durability - like the claimed drop resistance, water resistance, etc.... But still got a case and a screen cover as crap happens. Overall I am very glad to have found this phone, it's what I needed.","November 16, 2020"
3155,Samsung Galaxy XCover,T Kebbe,4,"I love the phone. It is so much nicer than my older Note 4.  It has Facial Recognition, as well as a Fingerprint Reader. This Fingerprint reader is now part of the on/off button on the side of the phone. You only need to position your index finger on it as you hold the phone in your hand... no more swiping your finger!  In addition to the up and down volume toggle buttons on the right edge of the phone, there is a power button which is also the finger print reader. There are two additional buttons, one of the left edge and one on the top edge, both of which can be assigned to an app or a event.  The LED light used for notification has been moved from the top front of the phone to the top edge of the phone, so you can't always see the LED flashing unless you're looking at the top edge of the phone.The phone is thin and actually longer than my Note 4. In addition, the screen is larger and resolution is higher especially since the the display is the entire front, as there is no loner a bezel. Even the front facing camera is inside the screen display, which is strange when looking at a picture since you may think that there is a black dot in the top right of the picture, when actually it is the front facing camera.Since the phone is not sold by Verizon, I had some issues getting it provisioned.  Some of the Verizon employees said it wasn't supported, when in fact it is. The phone has two SIM card slots. When I entered the 1st IMEI number (slot 1) on the Verizon site, it said that this phone is a perfect match. I eventually got it provisioned by swapping the SIM card between my Note 4 and XCover Pro phones.  The only remaining issue is that voice mail doesn't work when the SIM in in the XCover Pro.  I have to believe that that will eventually get fixed. (I am on hold with Verizon as I type this).The documentation is almost useless. A simple pamphlet is provided with a basic diagram, but it is not clearly evident that slot 1 actually has a lower slot for a Verizon nano SIM card, and an upper slot, for the SD card.  There is of course a second SIM card slot to the right of first for a GSM SIM card. You need to remove the large battery to access any of the slots (which is simple).  Also the first SIM card slot has a very tiny embedded lever that allows you to easily remove the nano SIM card! I didn't look to see if the second SIM card slot has a similar lever.","July 18, 2020"
3156,Samsung Galaxy XCover,Mack,4,"Very nice phone with a few caveats. First I am a consumer user not a business enterprise.The phone is fast, very nice screen, quality build with Android 10, no carrier bloatware. The big thing for me is the replaceable battery. Every new smartphone I have had to buy is because the built battery would not hold a charge and was a pain to replace. (I know I have done it myself).Now for some issues with setup.  There is no user manual available.  I went to the Samsung site and not there.  Therefore you have to stumble through by yourself.Inserting the SIM and SD Card.  The phone has SIM 1 and SIM 2.  for Verizon use SIM 1.  The SIM card is installed under the SD Card.  The slots are under the battery.  Turning the phone on is intuitive, push the button on the side.  Turning the phone off is not intuitive, the button does not work.  The off button is on the upper right corner next to the settings button, both visible after swiping down.  Transferring data and apps from your old phone is a snap, follow the prompts.Since this a Global phone when you turn it on it automatically selects the best carrier, GMS or CDMA.  What this means when you turn it on the first time it will connect but maybe not to Verizon.  Here is what you have to do.Go to:SettingsConnectionsMobile NetworkNetwork ModeManualNetwork OperatorsChoose VerizonNow you are all set and on the Verizon network. If you try to activate on line with the EMIE it tells you it is invalid however the phone is on the network and works fine.  I called Verizon and the only reason this happens is that the global phone is not yet in their EMIE database yet it will work fine (Verizon sells the same phone with a slightly different sub-model number).  The only thing you will notice is that on line under ""My Devices""  you will see your phone number but no picture or model of your phone.Some have questioned say that the phone does not support WIFI calling, it does in fact support WIFI calling, to activate you have to enter emergency contact information.  I know this correct because I have it set up for WI-FI calling.  Just ordered an OTTERBOX from their website, 20% less than on Amazon with free shipping.Hope this helpful, great phone","June 9, 2020"
3157,Samsung Galaxy XCover,AutoKlick,5,"TL;DR: If you want an S-Pen, iPhone, or a phone to play PUBG on this is not your phone. Everyone else should seriously consider it.If anyone asks you what phone they should buy, this should be #1 on the list. It's not for everyone - but it is for everyone that doesn't know enough about phones to know why they need the latest Galaxy S, Note, Asus ROG, or other specialty or flagship phones.This phone is rugged, yes. but it looks almost identical to most every black rectangle out there. Nobody is going to look at this phone and think it's for construction workers. It's got a little extra on the corners, and a slight lip around the screen to keep the screen safer. It doesn't affect usability in any way.Why else should this phone be at the top of lists? There's so many good reasons:* Durability. Yeah, no phone is invincible, but being able to survive getting knocked off a table onto a tile floor is great (and the reason I had to replace my wife's phone).* Headphone jack. Yep, their loss isn't mourned or protested anymore, but it's nice to have.* Waterproof. Every phone should be.* User replaceable battery. This phone proves that there is no valid argument about phone thickness, bulkiness, or loss of waterproofing by offering this. It takes 5 seconds to swap a battery.* Expandable memory slot. Still on most phones, but this phone does it without giving up a second SIM card slot.* Dual sim. A lot of phones give up the memory card slot to have this feature. Not this phone. Put two lines in it, and a memory card.* USB-C. It doesn't have the blazing fast charging rates that the Note 10 has, but it's still fast.* Fingerprint reader in the power button. In-screen readers are still terrible (nearly unusable at times in my Note 10), this one is fast and accurate.* Modern Processor. The Exynos 9611 isn't their flagship processor, but it's a huge step up from what is put in most of the rugged phones out there. It's about equivalent to a 2018 flagship chip (Snapdragon 665) in terms of speed. Plenty fast for anything that isn't ""hardcore"" phone gaming.* IPS screen. Not a flagship OLED screen, but it looks fantastic, and better than standard LCD.* Gorilla Glass 5. Scratch resistant and tough.* Notification LED. I miss this on newer phones, but it has an LED so you can see if there's active notifications.* Regular and wide angle lenses.* Half the price of a Galaxy S20.Nitpicks (or the only stuff I miss from a flagship device).Tap to wake is not enabled by default.The holepunch camera hole is bigger than flagship phones.Single speaker instead of stereo.It might be larger than some people want.No Samsung Pay means you can't use it with old magnetic-only card readers.No 5G. This is a stretch, since few phones do have it.","June 4, 2020"
3158,Samsung Galaxy XCover,Amazon Customer,3,"I've been using the Samsung Galaxy XCover Pro for about one month now. All of the features of this device are exactly as described and as advertised. Two of my biggest complaint are first, it takes the phone almost 2 minutes to fully power up. I'm not certain why. I've researched on Samsung, watched Youtube vids, read online articles, read community forum reviews. Unfortunately, I have not found any helpful tips to resolve this issue. Second, BEWARE! There are a lot of system updates right after you get the phone setup on your carrier's network. You can delay the updates but at some point, you're going to want to just do them for the security and functionality of the device. My advice is to ensure you are connected a very good private wifi connection. I do not recommend doing the system updates over your carrier mobile network. It will take way too long. Watching videos and reading through the user guide is very helpful to learn about all the features of this otherwise amazing phone. Hope this review is helpful. I have no regrets about purchasing this device.","December 10, 2023"
3159,Samsung Galaxy XCover,B Rodgers,5,"I like this phone a lot.  I got this to replace a Samsung Galaxy S6 Active.  That six year old phone was the most trouble-free phone I've ever owned going all the way back to the mid-1990s.  I've been hard on it, but it still looks like a brand new phone.  I was reluctant to give it up, but the battery was giving out, the phone was spending a lot of time tethered to the charger, and the case is sealed so it's not easy to change the battery.  I decided to go with a new phone instead.The Xcover PRO is actually a lot larger and heavier than I was expecting, but I'm getting used to it.  I unboxed the phone, put the battery in it and charged it up.  It took about 90 minutes for a full charge.  Transferring my old apps and contacts to the new phone was painless and was over in mere minutes.  I plugged in the SIM card and made a few calls on it.  It works fine on AT&T.  Battery life appears to be excellent.  I still have more than 50% at the end of the day, so I could probably get through a second day at work without having to recharge.  The camera gets some great shots.  I love the combo side key/fingerprint reader.  It's the perfect place to put it... right on the unlock button.Nothing too mysterious about this phone.  It took me a little while to puzzle out where the SD card plugs in.  Get a magnifying glass and look for the legend stamped in the case next to the SIM slot.The only minor gripe is that some of the stuff that this page says comes with the phone wasn't in the box I got.  It was all just minor stuff, so it didn't prevent me from using the phone, but I'll include it here so that the seller can correct their information on this page (or if it is correct, maybe they could just send the stuff to me).  Here's their full list:Handset  IncludedTravel Adapter  IncludedData Cable (also for charging)  IncludedHeadset  IncludedSim Card Ejection Pin  NOT IncludedRechargeable Battery  IncludedUSB Connector  ???

3160,Samsung Galaxy XCover,Verified Purchaser,4,"I've dropped this phone from over 1 story at a work site and all that happened was the force of the impact made the battery come out and it left a little scuff mark on the edge of the phone. Aside from that, everything in it still works fine. Also it's a pretty slim phone that you can easily carry around in your pockets. The camera is nice, I've used it for a few shots in a short film I'm putting together. The only complaints I have are: the touch sensitivity can be kinda lacking, sometimes I have the touch screen doesn't register in certain spots, so I have to press a few times or harder. Also it would be nice if I could figure out how to turn off the tint on the screen, idk if it's a permanent blue light filter, but it throws me off sometimes. Lastly, I really hate how samsung tries to encourage you to use it's Bixby feature, which gets in the way of other task that are more important, like turning off the phone.. now you have to press and hold two buttons at the same time (power and down volume) to prompt the phone to turn off, restart, or go in airplane mode. However if you accidentally press and hold just the power button, it activates Bixby, pretty annoying and invasive, imo. I would still recommend, or if you have more money, maybe look into the Cat phones, I think they're american made too!","January 4, 2022"
3161,Samsung Galaxy XCover,RANDALL W WINCHESTER,3,"I really didn't want to get this phone but was forced to by ATT. This is the best se.i-ruggedized phone they will now allow on the network. I had to replace my Doogee 96s pro as it isn't on ATTs approved list even though it technically supported VoLTE completely on the network.Problems I have with the Galaxy is that it really doesn't seem to be a ruggedized phone. It has little protection from drops and the removable back cover is super thin and flimsy. There are no covers for the ports. Even though they are internally sealed water can get in them and cause issues. The first thing I had to do was buy a good case and screen protector to make up for some of these shortcomings.  Then, the processor isn't the best and it shows some. No huge issues but some things aren't as instantaneous as I'm used to on better ruggedized phones. The ram is sorely lacking and so is internal memory.  For less money my Doigee had a better processor and twice the memory.  This is a huge mistake on Samsung's part in my opinion.The cameras are the minimum I would accept in a smart phone and really lacking compared to other higher end ruggedized phones.  The resolution of both is half of the Doogee and the doogee wide angle is way better. On top of that this phone offers NO dedicated camera like the FAIRS and IR night vision other higher end ruggedized phones add.The one positive is that this does out shine the Kyocera phones ATT offers as ruggedized phones.","February 22, 2022"
3162,Samsung Galaxy XCover,Joshua M,4,"Coming from an iphone I really dislike the android system and google especially, but I took a chance with this phone and I suspect like everything new after I use it enough I will get used to Android.  So I really don't like the operating system yet.  However the phone itself is wonderful!  Much cheaper then a new iphone, a great screen, love the size, the multiple buttons available for different uses.  I am VERY hard on phones and 2 things brought me to this, the first being its ruggedized.  Have already dropped it from about 4 feet onto a wooden floor a few times, absolutely no issues.  Got it covered in snow several times, big deal, wiped it off, stuck it in my pocket.  So far completely bombproof.  The extra batteries.  A removable battery!  What an amazing old fashioned idea!  Love it!  My iphone battery lasted about 2 years.  So I went out and bought 2 extra batteries for this phone and just rotate them through every few days.  Cost $25 each and had to order them from England but the lady was totally awesome and they arrived here in the US in 3 days.So, don't like the OS but I will get used to it.  OH and I DESPISE the keyboard for texting!  The  key sizes and spacing are all wrong for me and I constantly misspell but hopefully will get better.  But the phone itself is wonderful so far. I would very much recommend it.  I get a solid 36 hours out of a battery, its bombproof so far and I love the screen.  Buy some extra batteries and its a great package.","February 17, 2021"
3163,Samsung Galaxy XCover,Doc Savage,1,"First off, this phone felt great in my hand, which only made the rest of my experience that much harder to accept. My whole family is on a T-Mobile plan. T-Mobile is also one of the most accessible providers in the US when it comes to BYOD (bring your own device) phones, and every ""unlocked"" phone I've ever had worked with their network, except this one. Data works fine over the 4G network but it's when you go to make a call that things get crappy. As soon as you dial out or the phone starts to ring for an incoming call, it switches over to 3G and you get all the quality of a 20 year old technology. T-Mobile was super helpful and bumped me to higher tier tech support immediately, but soon tracked the problem down to this model not being compliant with their VoLTE system, which is because Samsung didn't make the phone compatible with the T-Mobile network. No option of getting a network update exists from T-Mobile, because they're not the ones writing that code, Samsung is.Samsung's tech support was an embarrassing testimony to a behemoth in the cell phone world. Their business tech agent (this phone is part of their business line of devices) had almost no information in her system about this issue. In fact, the IMEI number showed up as being locked to Verizon while the phone's own  model number, software, and box all indicated it was an unlocked version. All the poor lady could do was recommend I go back to T-Mobile and ask them to make it work. T-Mobile also has a page where you can check to see if your device is compatible with BYOD, and entering the IMEI on that page immediately returns the message that the Xcover Pro is NOT compatible. All-in-all, the experience left me with a nasty taste for Samsung in my mouth. I sold my old phone the day before the new one arrived, but because of the incompatibility I ended up without a phone for three days, which in this day and age is horrible when you run a business and need to make and take calls, navigate to customers, and deal with emails on the run. The phone seemed great, but the experience was awful.The moral of the story is that Samsung is presenting this phone both here on Amazon as well as on their own website as an unlocked phone, which it is not - at least in the generally accepted meaning of that word. It may be unlocked from Verizon, but it's not compatible with a lot of other carriers. A customer shouldn't have to actually buy the phone to test it out or check it for compatibility (you need an IMEI number in most cases to do this). This information should be clearly presented by Samsung, and it's their failure that it's not. Shame on them!Edit to add: A lot of other reviews here mention problems with Wi-Fi calling, but I wonder whether some of the posters are confusing that with VoLTE which is like Wi-Fi calling but over the provider's data network. I personally did not have issues with Wi-Fi calling. It connected to my home network just fine and when connected, it used that connection for inbound and outbound calls (the LTE signal bars disappear when you're on a Wi-Fi network). It's the VoLTE part of the equation that's the issue with this phone on some carriers. It simply isn't capable of using many of the data networks for voice calls, which almost any other modern phone can do.","September 26, 2020"
3164,Samsung Galaxy XCover,T L Fulton,4,"I'm disappointed that only the international version has an FM tuner, and that this wasn't explained until I contacted Samsung tech support chat. On the other hand, it has a replaceable battery, microSD card slot, and headphone jack on a rugged Samsung phone in 2021. It is also made in veitnam instead of China. This is what sold me on it, the fm tuner would have just been a bonus. Finger print reader is just OK. Maybe it's just my fingers that get cut up at work, but the old AGM X2 had a larger sensor on the back of the phone that never complained that my finger wasn't all the way on the sensor. AGM X2 had a 6000mAh battery, and this XCover just doesn't hold a candle to it battery life wise with its 4000ish battery. But it's replaceable, so I plan on buying a spare or two.I also don't like the fad of putting the camera inside the screen, it's like a constant circle of dead pixels. The iPhone notch wasn't any better. Just give me my larger bezel back. Oh well, I'll probably get used to it eventually. I had an AGM X2 for 4 years, let's see how this one survives.","October 9, 2021"
3165,Samsung Galaxy XCover,T Kebbe,4,"I hung on to my S5 Active for 9 years, because nothing else had a usable replaceable battery.  Then the price on the XCover Pro came down to something reasonable.  My only complaint.  Does not have voice answer like my old phone.  I had to get used to using the steering wheel button in the truck to answer calls.  If I'm in the older car with no phone interface, the call has to go to voice mail, I'm not going to mess around with a phone while driving.","August 31, 2023"
3166,Samsung Galaxy XCover,N D Jones,5,"This is an excellent smart phone at a reasonable price. My previous device was a Samsung ""Active"", which had an area fingerprint reader on the back surface that was nearly useless as it required the orientation and placement of my finger to be nearly perfect. This reader is essentially a linear array, and so well integrated into the inset-side-mounted on/off button that it is reliable, hence routinely useful. I purchased the phone through Amazon (good), and followed the on-line guide to transfer files and set it up (again, good). Transfering my activated AT&T account was another matter. The technical information that came with the phone made a point that a certain (specified) SIM card was required. To my eyes, that description did not match the SIM card in my Active. Calls to AT&T did not work. A visit to the local AT&T store at first was unsuccessful. The clerk shook his head and walked away, passing off my request to another agent. She pointed out that the SIM in my older Active was the correct variety, and in a few minutes had switched them out, tested, and verified that all was well. She told me that Samsung has used the same SIM card on all of their phones for the past several years. Easy peasy for the cognizenti :~) Other features...The back plate of this phone removes easily (without tools), allowing access to the innards. The battery may be removed (for security if required), replaced, or swapped out to be charged externally (extra equipment needed). There is an internal slot for another chip to increase storage. The screen is hardened glass, so that no screen protector should be required.","April 22, 2021"
3167,Samsung Galaxy XCover,zerotsm,1,"This phone worked great for about 6 months and then it became a nightmare!  It started having screen issues after a software update or so it seems as there were no other changes that had been made to the phone. The screen would not come on bright enough to see what was on the phone.  I then contacted Samsung customer service to try to figure out a fix. After trying several different things including clearing cache and even a factory reset it was determined I needed to take it to a repair store.  Huh none exist that will mess with an X Cover Pro so it had to be sent to a Samsung facility in Texas. So after a week without my phone it was sent back and I was told there were no issues found.  Well that is wonderful because upon unboxing my phone and attempting to turn on low and behold, ""Same Issue"". The screen was impossibility dim and it took several minutes of messing with it to get it to come up. (And yes adaptive brightness is turned off) So I was informed by another Samsung tech rep to ""send it in again and have them look at it"" the rep then said if they cannot figure anything out they will send me another phone of the same model. Well thats fair right. Or so I thought because after determining that they were unsure of what was wrong with the phone and I was owed a replacement they told me it would be 15 days before one would be sent out...  Ok, my agitation is growing because after 2 days in shipping and another few days in the facility being looked at combined with the previous sending in I am now without the device for over a month.But we haven't made it to the best part yet... The replacement does the same crap. After about a month it has started doing the same thing. The only thing that changed was another software update and it very well might just be coincidence. Although now I am not so gentle with the phone. I have found that when the issue happens if you smack the phone against your palm it will come on. Sometimes it takes once or twice sometimes more but Samsung wants me to play UPS tag with them again.  Arrrrrg.So if I may I would suggest to stay away from the X Cover Pro and find something a bit more common as it is great in theory but failed in use.","March 23, 2021"
3168,Samsung Galaxy XCover,rkr,3,"The major problem with the phone is that battery life is short and after a charge it gets drained in 6 hours or so.

3169,Samsung Galaxy XCover,Linda,5,"I was hesitant to buy a new phone. In fact I was so hesitant I still had a Samsung S5 in 2021. My  biggest concern was not having a removable battery so this phone was obviously my top choice. I was worried about it being too big, that some users had issues with WiFi calling and the fact it was new technology. So I’m not sure why people had trouble using WiFi calling I was able to turn it in simply under call settings on Verizon. I was worried about not having a home button, but the new technology is great, I don’t miss it. I was worried about upgrading to a type c charger from old school usb, it’s awesome. I love my phone so much, there are only a few things I don’t like. So there are few cases available and they aren’t cute, which I get it’s a rugged phone but I like my speck cases and none fit. It is also is missing the always on display. I know I could buy myself a watch, but I really miss my Always on Display. While I’m sure it’s not good for the battery life, I used it a lot and have had it for awhile..... that’s honestly my only issues. I plan to keep this phone for a long time so I’m ok with it being a bit pricey. If you are on the fence, buy the phone, you’ll be thankful.","March 19, 2021"

Don't believe the review that says that there's a Samsung update coming up that will make the second slot operative.Coming from using Samsungs Active (my last one was a S7 Active) , this XCover feels fragile.Battery is just adequate for today's standards.I definitely need a Dual SIM phone, so, I'll give this one to my mom when I find a reliable one for me.Almost forgot, I use it with T-mobile, I can only get up 7-8 Mbps, according to them it's because the phone lacks one the bands in which T-mobile provides higher speeds.I get 50 Mbps when using an AT&T SIM card.Finally, $300-$350 should be a fair price for this phone, not $500!","November 18, 2020"

The old phone was only 3G, and had a built-in SIM, so we needed a new one for this phone.  The Verizon person popped in a new SIM and went through the activation procedure, but it didn't work.  He then referred us to Verizon Tech Support.  It took a week of repeated phone calls and attempts by the customer service representatives to activate it before they realized that, by Verizon policy, it will only activate on a business account.

I bought four spare batteries.Most phones these days don't have a microSD slot. This one does. I have a 128GB microSD card in mine, lots of room for MP3's and MP4's etc. I have multiple microSD cards with different files on them.This phone resists the compromising trend to use the USB C port for audio, it has the standard 1/8"" audio output jack.

Completely inadequate for a demanding business environment. This is not a power user's phone. I did understand going into this that it was a mid-range phone, but it's inability to multitask was exacerbated by the fact that Android 10 is great at multitasking operations. I tried this phone for 28 days and had to return it. I loved the ruggedness, the removable battery which I was unable to find in the US sadly, the potential for Pogo charging which I was unable to find in the US sadly..The phone I had before this was a note 8 which is definitely a flagship phone of its day, so someone coming from an older non flagship phone would probably be happy with this. It also made me sad that Samsung pay wasn't available at all.  Even for non MSG payment.Ultimately I ended up getting an s10e which is such an excellent phone and has a flat screen which was one of my biggest wants after spending so much on curved screen protectors of any kind of quality.Overall I would say pass it unless you expectations of multitasking and power using are set quite low.","August 1, 2020"

3182,Samsung Galaxy XCover,Jazzie Holt,5,"Have had this phone for a about a month now. Works great and takes perfectly fine photos, BTW (better than what I had from Samsung four years ago). It's truly rugged, and has a snappy response to the apps and functions. The mono-speaker is just fine as a speakerphone, too, almost too loud for my 70-year-old ears. Battery requires just one charge in the early morning and keeps going all day (YouTube vids, music, exercise app, timer, weather, solitaire/checkers/chess... and all the other power-hungry apps I use), especially with the Android 10 features helping to monitor and manage power usage. Will order a replacement battery when they are available in the U.S., which means I can keep my phone running in tip-top shape for years! Thank, you Samsung for bringing back the replaceable battery, on this phone at least! Is it the ultimate smartphone in 2020? No. But it hits the sweet spot for me: all the functions I need, a great price, and a phone that will not die when the first battery gives out.","June 29, 2020"

I can only assume the phone is flexing in my pocket, even while in a top of the line case, and  this has pulled the connection out. REALLY poor offering in terms of a 'rugged' phone for $500 bucks. The screen cuts in and out, has deteriorated quickly in the past 2 days when the problem started and should be unusable entirely within the week. Otherwise, I love the phone, but save yourself the headaches.

There's no pattern or reason for it. sometimes it's while I'm using it other times it's just randomly while it's sitting there. It would do this about 10 times a day. I registered the device with Samsung and contacted them about the issue. They sent me to a repair shop. They told me it was a software issue/app issue and advised me to do a factory reset and delete any apps I could. I did as they instructed and still had the same issue. I contacted Samsung again and they kept trying to send me back to the repair shop. I finally told them id like to use the warranty because I had the issue out of the box. They told me that all they can do is keep sending me to the repair shop because I didn't send it back within the first two weeks. The only reason i didn't send it back within the first two weeks was that they made me go to the repair shop. I like to think I got a faulty phone but that along with the bad customer service makes me recommend you don't buy this phone.","March 14, 2022"

The screen would no come on unless I pushed on the center of the screen. No damage to the screen and the phone was not dropped. Had Samsung warranty repair product. After it was fixed I decided to no longer carry it while working and just left it in my vehicle so it would not break. Well that did not work. After 5 months the same issue reoccurred. I spoke with Samsung and asked if they would exchange my phone or refund me. They said there is a 28 day return policy and there are no exceptions. Very disappointed with the phone and Samsung company. I bought several Samsung products in the past, but I will never buy a Samsung product again after this. I am going to send my phone into get warranty repaired for the second time but have no hope that it will last. I had my work phone that I carry for 4 years now without any issues. It is a iPhone 6.

This device is NOT on AT&T's VOLTE list, so they won't activate it without jumping through a bunch of hoops even if you buy one from them.  It doesn't have the bands to work on T-Mobile, so that's a no-go.  It does work on Verizon though! (except for the fact that voicemail never worked on one of them and they never could figure it out and a recent update nuked BOTH of these phones on my account, and Verizon's repeated message is that I needed new SIM cards that also never fixed anything through the 3 times changing them.)As for the device itself, there's no wireless charging which is no fun.  The cameras are better than most ""rugged"" phones, and overall the performance is pretty snappy.  The screens on both devices have noticeable darkening at the top and bottom edges, almost like the backlight doesn't go all the way to the edge.2 stars is probably generous, but I really wanted to like this phone.","July 14, 2021"

This is extremely annoying not to think it may even be illegal.This is the second one of these I have purchased, the first one was a VERIZON listed phone, it had dual sim slots and both IMEI numbers were listed on the ""about Phone"" screen along with the devise serial number, however neither IMEI numbers would work on Verizon.  Even though we ran the IMEI numbers on the Verizon website and they both came back as compatable for verizon network, no one at Verizon could get it to work, however I put an AT&T sim card in he phone and it worked fine.  Calling Samsung support was like calling Joe Biden, totally clueless and no help.  The first samsung tech never heard of the phone, the second Samsung tech could not offer any explanation why the phone would not work.This phone was and still is advertised as a dual sim card phone.

The sims for both the donor phones worked well, but when placed into this Xcover pro, whichever sim was in the 2nd sim tray was not seen by the phone, nor was there a sim manager installed in the settings as is on dual sim phones. I believe the phone had incorrect firmware/software installed from the factory.  After a long, long, session with Samsung help, I was directed to take the phone to a Samsung authorized repair center. I explained the problem to them, and they said they would probably have to reflash the firmware.  When I returned to pick up the phone the repair tech said the phone  needed to have the correct firmware/software installed, but since it was an international phone, not a North American phone Samsung would not allow them to do that. In other words, Amazon sold me an international phone which did not work due to Samsung's not installing the correct firmware/software, and because it was not a North American phone, Samsung would not allow it to be repaired in North America. Thanks a lot Amazon and Samsung! No less than 10 hours of my time wasted on this brick! I'll be getting a RMA and returning it today.

Mileage may vary of course, but with TMobile I haven't had issue with it activating automatically. Big plus!Phone is overall a great buy. Doesn't have all the bells and whistles of higher end phones, but is snappy and fairly free of the typical bloat you get preloaded on other phones.

Advertise replaceable batteries but that's a lie too unless you want to order from another company that no one's ever heard of in another country. It's supposed to be professional work quality yet you can't seem to get any work done on it because it constantly crashes it sucked from day one but since the latest security update this is pretty much unusable. I bought this what's the dual SIM capability to upgrade from two very old phones to one new phone. Sadly the ancient technology I have a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and an iPhone 7 plus are light years ahead of this piece of trash. While looking in my account to see if there was still any option to return it I see there is a trade-in option LOL even Amazon knows this phone is a steaming pile of trash because they sell you a $500 phone and 3 months later they offer to let you trade it in on a new one for a value of $45,"November 15, 2020"

And the doozy: phone is supposed to be 'waterproof', only problem is the USB port insists that phone is wet even when it couldn't possibly be, like after charging to 100% over night and waking up to see the phone says it's wet.  Now once it says it's wet you're done because it won't charge and takes typically 8 hours to 'dry'.  If you're on a mission or just on the road with maps, you're screwed.  Flush cache, restart, fan, vacuum cleaner, rice... Doesn't matter.  Yes, the phone allows you to replace the battery but who wants to do minor surgery every three hours and carry an external charger just because of a bug.Apart from #3, which in my opinion makes the phone useless for mission critical 'activities' it works ok for someone, just not for anything I need a phone for.","August 11, 2020"

3220,Samsung Galaxy XCover,Bob Cox,5,"So far I've had it about a month and it works great. The finger print reader never reads the first time maybe because I'm using my left hands pointer finger. That's what's easiest to use when I'm holding it with my left hand. I could see where it would work better in your right hand with the thumb. But overall it is what I want. I was a fan of the Samsung Active and this is very similar. Also, I am using at&t and live in Missouri and I get service everywhere.","June 20, 2021"
3221,Samsung Galaxy XCover,Fritz,4,Great phone does what it says on the can. Biggest let down and it's a big one.DOES NOT come with Wfi  calling. So your screwed when in a patchy signal area.Would not have purchased if this would have been mentioned in the description.,"January 22, 2021"
3222,Samsung Galaxy XCover,shantelle,2,"I have perfect service at my house with my (4 year old)  iphone through att. I thought this would be a perfect upgrade for me due to working construction and frequently exposing my phone to cold/wet/dusty conditions for work and play. I will not be able to find out if this phone is great because for whatever reason I cannot make calls or receive calls at home. If there was wifi calling option, it would be fine. It makes no sense that my old phone had perfect LTE service and this 'state of the art' $500 phone can't even let me use the most important function on the phone at home.

3223,Samsung Galaxy XCover,T L Fulton,5,"I got LTE service working without any issues on my unlocked XCover Pro, but voice calls and text messages would not work at all. I must have talked to at least half a dozen tech support people at Verizon who swore up and down the device should work on Verizon's network, but it just wouldn't activate.The trick was to put the SIM card into a Verizon approved device, activate it in that device, then move the SIM card back to SIM slot 1 in the XCover Pro. Everything worked perfectly after that.","August 20, 2020"
3224,Samsung Galaxy XCover,T Kebbe,5,"This is a big upgrade for me and also the first phone in awhile that I get 4G LTE service. All my previous phones xcover 3,4,4s, didn't support the 4g. So I was stuck on 3.5gThis phone so far has met my expectations as I have kept them in check. I can say that it is water resistant as I took this phone 2 days after receiving it. On a 2 hour rafting ride. It definitely got wet and submerged. If ur wondering my provider. I'm on straight talk. I get LTE all the time now.","June 20, 2020"

Phone feels solid especially when in a protective case.  Software is adequate for everyday normal use.  Battery life is great! Overall I'm very pleased with this purchase!","September 6, 2021"
3226,Samsung Galaxy XCover,Simons Music Profile,1,"I bought this phone because I am an AC Technician and I am in harsh climates a lot. I go through phones fairly quickly because they are built to be extremely fragile. I found this phone and its designed for people like me who want a reliable sturdy phone. I initially liked this phone. Im not a big phone guy, I just want something that can do the basic functions. After only a couple months when I would try to unlock my phone I noticed the brightness would not increase, the phone was extremely dim to where I wasnt sure if the phone was even on. I figured out it was unlocked because I could turn the flashlight on with the top button. After messing with it for a while the display would brighten, but its only getting worse. it constantly flickers and goes dark. I got this phone to be reliable and last me a long time but Ive only had it for 4 months. It is garbage and I highly recommend staying away.","September 11, 2021"

Then tried Samsung online customer support then tech support. Finally got someone at live tech support samsung who figured out that even though it show as a unlocked phone it is locked to verizon. Unfortunately I had to return the phone before spending any time with the device. Also as of today still no spare batteries available for this phone, unless your willing to import them from Europe.","July 8, 2020"

But the screen is brilliant, the processor is faster, there is twice as much memory (RAM and storage) and its battery is replaceable.You are basically getting a better performing slightly less "" millennial"" version of the S10...... for 500 bucksI love it and will probably buy another just to have it.","September 5, 2020"
3231,Samsung Galaxy XCover,ducky,2,"Bought this phone for my husband as a Christmas gift. Everything seemed to transfer over just fine. HOWEVER, it is like this phone is possessed. It randomly zooms in and out of things, putting me on speaker during a call doesn't work, but with others it does (and doesn't). My husband complains that it's too touchy and the screen selects things that he didn't even touch. Was hoping this would be a good fit seeing as he is so rough on devices. It is tough, but functionally inept.","April 29, 2022"

3233,Samsung Galaxy XCover,T L Fulton,1,"This phone was never great. I had 2 of it. The first one had to be replaced because it just turned itself off sometimes for example in the middle of the night while it was charging, while I was talking on the phone, trying to use it to navigate. So, it was pretty useless. The first one only lasted about a week. Then, I got it replaced my second one lasted almost a year, but not quite. It was stuck on the reboot screen. So, I tried to factory reset it, but it just completely went black and won't turn on.So, if you're fine with a phone that will only work for maybe 6 days to a year than this phone might be a winner for you. It's not even that effective as a paperweight after it quickly breaks beyond repair... you'd be better off just getting a rock.","November 28, 2021"
3234,Samsung Galaxy XCover,T Kebbe,5,This phone is a great bang for the buck. It does everything very well and has nice cameras. The wide angle feature is very nice. My only complaint is that the fingerprint reader is very inconsistent on whether it accepts the print or not. One thing to consider is that I use the otter box case which makes the sensor more recessed than on the original phone bare. Either way I wish it worked everytime more or less.,"April 22, 2021"

It's a 4G phone, but I figured I've never had a complaint with 4G speed--so I'm good with it. If you are looking for a new phone, this is a great one.

This phone gets cranky and won't charge in the presence of any moisture. This phone runs out of battery quickly. If you drop this phone it the case comes apart and sends the battery flying. The fingerprint reader hardly ever works. I was excited by the idea of a rugged Samsung. It's really not worth my time","December 31, 2021"
3240,Samsung Galaxy XCover,SKL,5,I bought this phone for the ability to use it as a dual sim phone. However you can not use it as a dual sim phone.

Knew from the get-go that I couldn't take it to ""the store"" for help.I managed to get everything to transfer (semi-computer/tech literate) and it's worked great for me.It does & can do WAY MORE than I will ever use, but it's held up under rough handling & farm conditions.","April 5, 2021"
3242,Samsung Galaxy XCover,Amazon Customer,2,"I went easy on this phone. I never dropped it, or got it wet. My last phone lasted 7-8 years. The slot for the charger started loose, and got worse until I had to balance the charger within a millimeter to get it to charge. It kept telling me the charger was wet despite never coming into contact with moisture. Now it won't take a charge at all. So I'm now trying to find battery chargers and spare batteries. So poor design on the hardware makes the phone useless, and a total waste of money.","April 7, 2021"

The Galaxy S22 Ultra is still an awesome phone, even though it's a couple of generations old now. Big beautiful screen and still one of the best cameras available on a phone.","July 17, 2024"
3244,SAMSUNG Galaxy S22,Christina,5,"I was needing a new phone and this was along the same series as my old phone: the Samsung Galaxy Note 9. This included my favorite feature, which was an included pen!Pros: Everything about it has been a great improvement!+ Fantastic photos! Included in my review is a photo of my cat. The photo is so clear, you could practically count each and every strand of fur.+ Great battery: much better than my old phone, I could carry this phone all day and not need to charge it until I'm home. I use it decently to watch YouTube, and by the time I'm done with my 8 hour shift, I still have 60% when I head home.+ The S Pen was again my favorite feature from my last phone. They improved the battery life of it and also made more features with the pen! With motion swipes of the pen, you could zoom in and out of the camera and then take a photo. Along with that, also adjust music volume or just switch to the next song!Cons:- If you prefer to use the aux cord, Sadly they removed it from the phone. It sucks since not everything I own has adopted to bluetooth.- No SD card slot, which means if you want more storage, you can not upgrade or purchase an SD card. The only solution is to get a cloud storage or get the same phone but with more storage space.Overall, despite the few cons, I am happy with my purchase. I would be even happier if they didn't remove them, but I still enjoy it and I haven't encountered any problems after months of use.","November 8, 2022"
3245,SAMSUNG Galaxy S22,R Sharp,5,"Purchased this phone because my S21 was stolen. Coming from that to a current premium flagship was appreciated, but feels like a luxury i don't deserve. The FHD screen is nice and the extra brightness does make the screen seem a lot more alive. The 108 mp camera is excellent and the charge speeds with a 45 watt charger are convenient. I believe the s pen is on a capacitor so it drains battery from the phone--kind of lame. Game play and video playback have been great so far, no problems. Phone can get from hots-spotting and multi-tasking but stays cooler than the S21. My main gripe about this premium flagship would be the battery life, but the charging speed while quick is a mediocre attempt to make up for it. So far no issues. Phone has been great with Tmobile. I bought the phone to replace my S21 and for it's trade-in value once the S23 is released. Great phone overall. Still feels like I have something I don't need.","November 6, 2022"

3247,SAMSUNG Galaxy S22,Kory B,4,"I initially had this phone to replace a Pixel 6 pro. I thought a bigger screen and 5 cameras would mean a better phone,,, well I was wrong!The S22 ultra is an amazing phone, I'll start with that. It's just not any different from the Note 20 which came out TWO years ago!! It feels and functions the same in a day to day basis.I also feel like 5 cameras are just too much to put on the back, it looks ugly and they don't make any difference for a casual photographer!Quick points of comparison if you were ever debating between both phones :Screen: both screens are amazing, obviously a bigger screen on the S22 ultra gives more room for watching or scrolling through your phone.Cameras : Honestly the pixel 6 pro seems to have a much better camera software. Photos seem to look better with the Pixel's camera without tweaking the shot while with Samsung you had to know exactly what to select to get a proper shot. The selfie l/front camera on Samsung still gives that washed out, not true, picture vs the Pixel's more natural look. Both are not great in low light situations, though night mode is a little better on the Pixel.Software: The pure Android experience on Pixel is unmatched! The phone is much cleaner and feels more efficient. With Samsung One UI skin, you get tons of useless things to do the same job! Everything is big and the side tray interferes with the Android 12 back gesture, you want to open a page there are 5 apps that can be used for it.It just feels cluttered and less appealing.Size: The pixel 6 pro, for me, feels like the perfect dimension, but thatay go down to each one's opinion. However the weight is just too much for the S22 ultra, it's also VERY slippery,that's basically unusable without a case.Going back to the pixel after many days with the S22 ultra just feels right and being more than $400 cheaper makes it a better deal as well.Battery: both have less than average batteries, which was a little disappointing, given that most of my other Samsung phones had pretty good battery life,, but not this one, you definitely can't have a full day of average use with full specs on this one unfortunately.Don't get me wrong, the S22 Ultra ia a very good phone, it's just not that much better than the 2 year old note 20,the curved screen feels a bit outdated, and it's much more annoying to use, and the camera software still isn't great.","March 5, 2022"
3248,SAMSUNG Galaxy S22,Patrick Chung,5,"So far its amazing, Samsung(Android) just wins me for everything-user interface, durability and design.  I'm no mac hater.

My last samsung was the s9 and it still works fine, just not catching up on what i use it for at work. This time im going for the top. I dont need high storage, Because I prefer cloud and my home based server storage.Its so fast with what I want it to do. I even tried it on gaming. And I was just omg I feel old and young at the same time. Thanks amazon and seller!, for the early arrival, it came just a day after my birthday, its supposed to be atleast two more weeks of wait.Migration was fast like crazy too, it included everything.

I was able to tell in the fist 5 minutes this was worth every penny. At least 15 times better than my last phone. If this broke today I'd eat Roman noodles every day till I can get another. It's a must have! Only thing I can even come close to calling a very minor flaw is that the buttons are so touchy and fast that when your trying to scroll sometimes you'll open apps your finger hit, but there are settings for EVERYTHING on this phone, so I'm sure there's one to turn down screen sensitivity. Just got it yesterday. Watched all kinds of YouTube videos and know I have so much more to learn, but all I got to say is this thing is phenomenal!!! One certain concern, is that when I signed into my Amazon account the alert I got named this device as generic android  4.0 and this I believe was not a refurbished phone.

I've had the 22 ultra for about a month now...Pros- great camera, great sound, Bluetooth connects immediately, the function is exactly like that of the s10+ I had before purchasing this one- so no confusing learning process had to take place, and the battery life is long lasting- I use mine to play music all day long, stream movies, plus I use several different social media off and on throughout the day. Also if you buy a fast charger that this phone is equipped to use and it takes less than an hour to completely charge this phone.Cons- price!

Luckily I already own galaxy buds 2 wireless earbuds, so even the lack of a headphones input doesn't bother me as much.The s pen is pretty cool. My kids love it. Battery life has been manageable.

I fully charged it in the evening making sure it got to a 100%, made sure no app was open in it and just left it and went to sleep. Woke up in the morning and I had only 35% battery left...and I was not even using it.

The battery life is only slightly improved from my old S10, the phone is HEAVY compared to the S10, which of course expected given that it's much larger. But with the extra size all you really get is a larger screen far better cameras and slightly increased battery. I personally bought the S22 on sale and for the camera so I don't regret buying it however I do miss not having the SD card as I take alot of photos so having to constantly plug the phone in to upload photos to my PC sucks.

3279,SAMSUNG Galaxy S22,Kindle Customer,1,"My phone lost signal after last software update. I've tried everything, there's no way my phone gets an stable signal from any of my two mobile providers. This is just unacceptable for a flagship smartphone. I was incredibly satisfied during the first year, now I feel stolen. I have over a month with no communication outside my home's wifi, and Samsung does not offer solutions, no patches, nothing. I have several Samsung devices but If they are trying to force me to buy an S24 they're totally wrong, I'll just switch to a brand I can really trust.","June 17, 2024"

If this is such a sensitive screen, the producer must protect it agains damage from very beginning - and put screen protector as factory default feature. what is the reason to sell it without protection if there is such a high probability of damaging it...the turn on turn off button is not also functioning well. overall waste of money!","March 2, 2023"

3329,Samsung Galaxy S22,Candy,5,"I got one for me initially. It worked well. Held charged and no visible damage. So I decided to get one for my mother, husband and father. They were all in excellent condition","July 30, 2024"
3330,Samsung Galaxy S22,Michael Laguardia,4,"I've been a huge fan of buying 1-to-2-generation old refurbished Samsung flagship phones. This is my second of them and I know some other people who have done it too and it's a great deal. This phone was top-of-the-line about two years ago. It is still a huge upgrade for me, replacing my 4-year-old Galaxy S10e that i obtained similarly back then. Very cheap, I was able to get this one for $235 which is a steal, this is much better than new phones in the same price range.Things I like about this phone: it's relatively small, very fast, the display is super crisp. It's great at getting signal, and wireless networks and bluetooth pairing all work beautifully. I usually talk with a headset but phone calls without a headset are fine. The camera is great quality-wise.Things I dislike about this phone: I would prefer it to be smaller. Phones keep getting bigger. The Galaxy S10e was slightly bigger than I like, and this one got a little bigger AND heavier. It feels bulky in my pocket. Also I don't like the location of the camera, because it tends to make the cases for this phone be very thin near the edge of the phone, which tends to make them break in that spot. And this is a design flaw with the phone, not the case, because the way the phone is made there is an area around the cameras that bumps out in such a way that makes it so you can't make that part of the case thicker. iPhones did a better job of this design, allowing for a slightly thicker piece of case.And the other downside is the bloatware. Samsung is awful for the bloatware. there are some notifications that are very hard to turn off, like the one about ""Find Your Phone"". Samsung is constantly pressuring you to sign into their service, and it makes it very difficult to sign out. Two-factor authentication required to sign out? What a farce. This phone made me very frustrated at the people who designed it.Lastly, the other things I really dislike about this phone, which unfortunately follows industry trends. There is no 3.5mm jack. I used that heavily and I really miss that. It's a big downside because now I can't use corded headsets, which I prefer in part because you don't have to change them. AND this does not have a removable battery.The battery going is usually the reason I have to replace my phone, so lacking a replaceable battery limits the lifetime of the phone. Replacing the battery is affordable if I can do it myself, if I have to drive to a store and pay someone to open the phone up to replace the battery, it's not really worth it. So basically the lack of replaceable battery makes this phone shorter-lived for me...especially since the battery life is perhaps not quite as good as it could be. It's not terrible, but you really do need to turn power saving on from the start. I also recommend charging only to 80% to prolong the life, and then just charging more frequently. This device seems to run a little hot which tends to make batteries wear out fast, so definitely watch that.With these limitations, I think this phone is still a great buy. But it does have some design flaws that unfortunately Samsung has not addressed in their newer phones. The whole industry has been moving in the wrong direction IMHO, planned obsolescence, making their devices non-repairable. I hate it. And because of it I refuse to buy new products. Buying old products like this is my way of protesting the industry. I refuse to pump big money into an industry that isn't representing my values and the things I care about in life.","July 21, 2024"
3331,Samsung Galaxy S22,Jessica Eadie,3,"Phone looks good, not a scratch on it.  Screen is hard to keep clean almost looks like it is not the original screen.  Can deal with that.  The main problem is the sound.  Very scratchy, cuts out during conversation, at times people can't hear me.  There are times sound is really loud and next it is so soft you can barely hear. Frustrating trying to carry on a conversation.I would never buy from this company again, as it seems they did a poor job of refurbishing this phone.","August 20, 2024"

3335,Samsung Galaxy S22,wil,4,"I've had it a week now, and it works fine as far as I can tell. I am very pleased indeed with the camera. It came with many scratches, but only along the fine edges. The screen is clean. The battery isn't very good, but it according to videos I've seen the battery on these things isn't great. It also heats up quite a bit, and I think that's to be expected from the S22 as well. All in all I'll keep it because it works well and it was cheap. Good value.","August 23, 2024"
3336,Samsung Galaxy S22,JB Housey,4,"First off, the phone arrived very quickly. Ordered it because I just needed a phone after one I had got damaged. The description said the phone, a cable and a charger was included in the box, but there wasn't a charger. There's a few scratches on the top right corner but a case will cover them. Two small deep scratches on the screen which will not impact or hinder the usability. Overall I am thankful with the Galaxy S22, it is a set up from my Galaxy Note 10 Plus which I have been using for over 2 and a half years.","August 8, 2024"
3337,Samsung Galaxy S22,mike osullivan,4,"Phone was in good condition. Was skeptical of the model 901w since many have posted reviews of it being only usable in Canada. Although, it is the model from Canada, I had no problems activating it on my Verizon network. I would have given the seller 5 stars but my phone arrived with no sim card tray. Therefore making it very inconvenient to activate the phone in the time frame that I was trying to do so. The seller did correct the mistake and I had no problem communicating with the seller. For all the given reasons is why I gave the seller 4 stars and not 5. If the sim card tray would have been with the phone, this would have been a great transaction. Thank you for correcting the mistake","July 15, 2024"

It's like a new phone to me that's working great thus far. Upgrading from an s10, i was also impressed by the camera quality. My only problem is the finger sensor that seems to be annoying so I used a lock code to unlock my phone.","July 20, 2024"

There is literally no issue with this phone, it charges great and has a great battery life, no cracks or chips or anything. The face recognition is a bit buggy so I chose not to use it, but I think that is more of samsung's fault more than anything else. Also for the fingerprint reader, it works great but for those who don't know, if you have a screen protector, you have to look through settings to make the screen more sensitive so that it goes through better (its labeled as such under settings>display>touch sensitivity). Otherwise, great phone that can handle a great amount of pictures and apps.","May 29, 2024"

So I got a power pack and that helps, but it's a shame I needed to do that.As for the fingerprint sensor, it just doesn't work half the time. S22 locks you out if you try repeatedly, and then you have to wait a while before it lets you try again.It came in almost-like-new condition but not in original packaging, no clear plastic protecting the glass, and without the quick start guide, which is downloadable (and I didn't need it). What I needed was the Samsung Smart Switch app, which sync'd my S9 apps, though not my app data. For example my voice-recorder data is still stuck on the old phone, not sure how to get that moved.Another minus was I couldn't get real accident insurance from Samsung or my carrier so I would have to go with 3rd party. Too much fine print for me to believe it's any good, so I'm `self-insured'. if I break the screen, it's never going to have any trade-in value and then I'll be looking for another refurb in the $400 price range. Better than paying like $200 for insurance and possibly deductibles for the next few years.","September 19, 2023"

Well, is the same effect, if you open a white background, you can see some light red spots and and rectangles on the screen.

3373,Samsung Galaxy S22,Mercedes T,5,My renewed Samsung S22 arrived as promised and looks new. It is replacing an S20 that disappeared several days ago. I am still rebuilding all the software that was lost but it has been relatively easy.,"July 25, 2024"
3374,Samsung Galaxy S22,Emmanuel,2,"I've been looking for a Galaxy S22, not a + nor an Ultra, because it's smaller, about the same size as my S10E, but much faster and more powerful.  I cannot tell how this reconditioned one, costing half what a new one cost, is different from new.  Transferring all my data and apps left only re-entering passwords and setting ring tones. So far, it's been the most seamless upgrade I've gone through for a cell phone.Update: after 2 days I'm pretty sure I'm keeping this phone. It's only about 1/8"" longer than the S10E it's replacing and is actually a bit lighter.  I had a few minor issues such as moving over Memo Pad--it whined about it being for older systems and Memo Pad Tools transferred the data to the wrong directory, but that was easily worked around. WhatsApp crashed and I had to reinstall but it's fine now. Battery life, which has been a problem in many reviews, is still better than the S10E... So far so good!Removing one star because getting this phone unlocked has turned out to be more problematic than it should be.  It's a T-Mobile phone, but T-Mo cannot unlock it (they tried) because it's been reconditioned. T-Mo contacted Samsung, no luck there either.  I tried an unlock service, they couldn't, and kept my $28 and won't refund it.  I've gone back to Amazon, on T-Mo's recommendation, and they are contacting the seller to try to get the phone unlocked.  I LIKE that it's a T-Mobile phone because it gives you free WiFi calling anywhere there's Internet, but I need it to be unlocked so I can use local SIMs when I travel.  I really prefer to have only one phone, and not have to play the risky game of switching SIM chips.  A dual SIM phone is useless for that if it cannot be unlocked.  So, until this is resolved, I'm not going to activate the eSIM and will use the SIM chip I had in my old phone.Final remark. Usually a phone can be unlocked but this one cannot. Not by a 3rd party unlocking service, not by Samsung, the manufacturer, not by T-Mobile, to whom the phone is attached, and not even by the vendor who wrote to me:""Unfortunately we can't guarantee that these stock of phones are able to be unlocked. This is why we are selling them as locked to a specific carrier. We also are unable to assist in unlocking this phone since we sold it as locked.""I'm leaving it at 2 stars because the vendor and Amazon are allowing me to return it. I've wiped the phone, which I really liked, and am forced to order a new one from Samsung at double the price, but if it cannot be unlocked then it defeats the purpose of buying it, which is to be able to use other carriers' SIM chips, specifically ALIV.","February 8, 2023"

3401,Samsung Galaxy S22,Eddie Soberanis,4,"I purchased this phone becuase it was cheaper than the unlocked US or INT version thinking I could use it on my carrier Mint Mobile for a few reasons. One, Mint is now owned by T-Mobile.  That apparently doesn't matter. Two Federal law mandates paid for phones must be unlocked by carriers. Apparently  T-mobile thinks this law applies only its customers. They won't unlock the phone unless you are a paying customer which I am not. I even paid for a shady unlocking service (which defeated the concept of buy a cheaper locked T-Mobile version) to unlock the phone and they could not. My only option was to return the phone which I did and was refunded.","August 4, 2023"

I've always bought my phones new but with the prices of phones getting expensive I thought I'd take a shot on a used one. I always take care of my phones and actually hold on to them as long as possible. Well, my Samsung S7 Edge just couldn't keep up with technology. YES! I've had a Samsung S7 in 2023. It was/is in near perfect condition even to this day. It was sad to let it go, but it was getting too slow on some apps.I bought this S22 and it's in perfect condition except for a small scratch on the glass. Only noticable during the day if you're really looking for it. Looking at the rest of the phone, you would think it was new.

The phone itself seems to be in ""excellent"" condition as was advertised, but please know that if you purchase this, you may need to inspect the SIM tray to make sure you have the correct one, or else the phone wont read your SIM card :( Once I bought the correct SIM tray for this S22, my phone immediately read the card and seems to function as it should.

YouTube can be watched in the front and the sound is wonderful.  I like to listen to organ music....... gorgeous sound. Visuals are sharp.  I think this is a fantastic phone. However, my puppy found it one day and put a couple of teeth marks on it.  So now the phone still works on the front as usual, but when you open it, the screens are black.  I tried to fix it but haven't been able to.  I tried another phone but I really wanted another folding phone,  So I ordered another one today!!  Nothing compares to it!","February 28, 2024"
3418,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Nikolaiski Ali,5,"It's very cool! I get a lot of people asking me about it. It feels weighted/sturdy without being heavy so it's not as easy to drop, has impressive camera quality and of course the flip function. It is a soft close so you can't snap it shut with the flick of your wrist, so I'm not worried about hinge damage. The screen is comfortable to hold despite its 6.8"" size. The cover screen is  easy to navigate (short tutorial provided) and gives you plenty of space to see your notifications. I've noticed bugs like with YouTube Music once I got this phone, it started skipping forward in the song, which my S20 did not do however this is probably fixable? The phone is super new so updates may take care of this hopefully.Also note the lavender option is pink with maybe purple undertones so you will be disappointed if you expect purple. I like pink so I'm fine with it.if you want the same specs as their Ultra versions, you may be disappointed. I personally love the camera (and have gotten compliments on it) and I can wait until the end of the day before I charge this, but I've heard people point out that Samsung's other phones are more advanced like with a bigger battery, higher camera MP, etc but I don't think the average consumer needs super high numbers in those areas. I don't regret my choice at all and I actually think this phone is still a better investment than other models. It's hard to beat a touch-screen flip phone and everything looks great to the eye. I am overall pleased and I recommend. Will update if anything changes.","September 17, 2023"

Unfortunately, in less than a year, the screen at the center was not working and eventually the entire screen went blank. I assumed this was my phon, not all Z Folds and sent it into Samsung for repairs to be told that the LCD condition is not covered in my warranty. So you are buying a phone that will not be covered in their warranty, and asked to pay $345 to replace the screen. What an epic waste of money. I will never be buying a Samsung product again. Is there no justice for me, I feel so robbed.","July 29, 2024"

3422,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Nikolaiski Ali,5,"Modern smart phones are getting bigger & bigger making it more difficult to comfortably carry them around.  By being able to fold the phone, you still get a large screen but in a format that fits comfortably in a pant or shirt pocket.Concerns I had were the slight ripple in the glass where the glass bends.  Often when watching YouTube I'd forget about it & only remember when sliding my finger across the screen feeling the smooth divot.  the other concern was about the hinges.  So far so good.  I specifically purchased the more expensive Galaxy Flip-5 vs the Razor because reviews made it sound like Razor hadn't worked out all the kinks.I'm not a heavy phone user so typically I have about 60% charge by the time I go to sleep at night.  The most I've ever got the battery down to was in the high 30% range.  The phone hasn't gotten hot while using or gotten funky.

Honestly, I never dreamed that I would pay over $1000. On a phone. But I was a fan of the original razor phone. And I have been wanting this since they started making it. So they had it where I could make payments. So I got it. It's got a amazing screen. You can't even see the bend unless you're just looking for it. You can feel it a little. But it has all the features that a iPhone has. Hell I actually like it better than a iPhone. It takes amazing pictures. Has a perfect sized screen. I have vision problems, but I don't struggle to see things on this device. It's got loud enough speakers. Watching videos are loud and clear. I couldn't be happier. I highly recommend. But if it breaks in the next little bit I will update my review.","May 29, 2024"
3426,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,MrsC,3,Honestly I was so excited for this phone. It's nice because it really fits in your pocket and it's convenient easy to get etc etc. But once I've actually had it for a few months I realize it really isn't as good as I thought it was. It glitches a lot it's not really fast and the strength of the magnet of closing it and opening it kind of wears off pretty quickly. Also having the built-in screen protector is very frustrating because it gets scratched up but there's not really a way to replace it unless you want to go specifically to a Samsung store to get it replaced. I kind of regret getting the phone but it is nice because you put it in your pocket and it doesn't fall out if you have small pockets. Also you get a lot of comments about it so that's something. I just think that it really needs an upgrade and a bit more work before it's fully ready. Also the battery life is literally one of the worst I have ever dealt with. I practically have to keep my phone plugged in all the time for it to survive a day. It's pretty ridiculous,"March 8, 2024"
3427,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Ann Snow,5,"This is a great phone. The hinge is very sturdy, and it feels nice. The crease is noticeable, but it has just disappeared from my vision. If you buy this, make sure to take good care of it, as folding phones are more delicate than normal ones. Otherwise, the folding ability is great and makes it very convenient. The outer screen is also great because you can use the main cameras for a selfie, and you can even fold it to prop it up on something.","June 3, 2024"

3429,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Tiffany Thomas,5,"Took advantage of a significant discount. I had been eyeing this phone for a while and thoroughly researched Youtube videos for reviews, comparisons, and setup tips. No regret. I wanted a small phone that can fit in pockets or small purse that took excellent photos: Does that. Previous models didn't close tight once folded and I felt could get caught in things in the mess of my purse. This one closes tight and yet is very easy to open. The cover screen is super convenient once you download the apps recommended by Youtubers. The ability to use the phone closed, open, or at an angle is also very convenient. Battery life is rather good (followed the battery saver recommended). Paired with a minimalist clear matte cover + a cover screen for the outside screen (purchased on Amazon): all fit absolutely perfectly. The inside screen already has a soft protection. Love that it is seriously water resistant. Before a phone was just a necessity, but I actually love this one.","November 20, 2023"

3431,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Nathalie,2,"I bought this phone for the compact nature.  When folded, it fits nicely in your pocket.  The initial phone I received lasted me just over 3 months.  The crease where the inner main screen bends as you open and close the phone developed a blacked-out bar and the phone would no longer function.  Within minutes, the entire screen started going black as well.  It was too late for me to return the phone to Amazon, so I contacted Samsung.  They made me go through their mail-in repair service (a process that can take 2 weeks).  Samsung has the option to fix or send you a new phone.  In my case, they sent me a new one (after about 10 days).  Getting a new phone meant that all my apps and data had to be reinstalled and reconfigured (a real inconvenience).  But, At least I have a working Z Flip 5 again.  Nevertheless, I'm very worried that the new phone won't last because of the constant bending of the screen.  I like to keep my phones for at least 3-4 years, and this phone, with the screen being bent numerous times per day, does not instill long-term confidence.  Samsung's warranty only allows for free repair and/or replacement one time (during the first year of ownership only).  I've used my ""one time"" and now I'm on my own if the screen goes bad again.  After one month, the 2d phone is doing okay, but only time will tell if it's going to hold up or not.","January 13, 2024"

3434,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,zhelon,5,"So, I got the Galaxy z flip 3 and then upgraded to this bad boy and I can honestly say, I can't see myself going back to your traditional slab phone. This phone is amazing and is definitely a fantastic upgrade from the three and even the four from what I've seen. After downloading both Theme Park and Good Lock apps, I see this phone as even better with freedom to use the cover screen for all applications (mileage may vary) and customizing the phone in general. I have a hard time thinking of ways they can make this phone better aesthetically. Of course they can improve it in the form of software updates, battery life, and of course the camera but even with that said, I love Samsung's flip phones and I highly recommend this one.","November 8, 2023"
3435,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,María Antonia,5,"I have been wanting the flip for so long and I finally took the leap. I'm so glad I did. Right off the bat, the only con is the slight crease. It doesn't bother me at all, but I can definitely feel it, and can definitely see it in some angles. Also the screen protector can be somewhat difficult to install.Pros: Battery life is great, camera is amazing, the screen is super responsive/smooth, and the front screen is such a cool feature, and so useful.I find myself flipping the phone shut as soon as I'm done using it and that's really helped me with my screen time. Sort of out of sight, out of mind. And because I can flip it shut, I can tuck it into smaller spaces. It even fits in my front pocket! This is unheard of for me.And the phone cases?? So cute. I love this phone.","October 9, 2023"

3439,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,valeria murillo,3,"I returned this phone because it wouldn't display the landing page for Public WIFI networks (multiple). Samsung support (poor) remoted in and claimed they had the remedy the issue but that wasn't the case. After researching things to try, working with my cellular provider and doing both a network and full factory reset the problem persisted. I think the problem might related to the Nov update that I installed on initial setup.I also found it irritating that when you have an app open on the cover screen you have to reopen it when you open the phone. I knew that that would be the case, but in use it became a source of irritation.","December 10, 2023"

3477,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Nikolaiski Ali,1,"I wouldn't have bought it if I had known this would happen to a brand-new phone after just three months of regular use. UbreakiFix, Samsung's authorized repair provider nearby, told me to go through Samsung's mail-in repair service as they didn't have parts to fix. They also told me that Samsung would send a replacement.However, it turned out that I don't qualify for a replacement because I bought my phone on Amazon, not directly from Samsung. This doesn't make sense to me, considering it is still a Samsung store on Amazon.com. Samsung told me that my only option is to use the mail-in repair service, which will take about two weeks. This is my first experience dealing with Samsung, and I am not impressed at all in terms of the quality of the phone and service.Most importantly, if the screen gets damaged again after the first free repair, the cost will be entirely on me. Given what has already happened, I believe there is a high likelihood of this occurring again.","December 24, 2023"

Now several lines deep, the display is completely shot and glitches out... Unable to unlock the phone except from the outside display has rendered this phone useless.I heard back from local repair centers and they've stated that this model is among the worst from this latest generation of flip phones.

I had just finished spray painting some metal, took the phone out of my pocket to set a timer and the screen cracked right on the fold. Solid random colors, the main screen is unusable.

The A52 is a hidden gem and is a better quality build than its successors. The device I received is in excellent renewed condition. There was no splash branding even though it's T-Mobile unlocked. All functions work, including 5g network (Red Pocket prepaid service). Overall, this is a great mid-range smartphone!","April 14, 2024"
3506,Samsung Galaxy A52,Drumdogma,5,"After my Pixel 3a got accidentally water logged when my kid's water bottle spilled in the car, I hemmed and hawed a lot over what phone to get.  I loved my pixel but most of the models were currently out of stock and I didn't really want to keep waiting for the new releases, so I did my research and landed on this phone.  So I will do my review relative to the pixel 3a I previously owned:1. The photo quality is comparable to or maybe better than the pixel 3a in my opinion (I'm not really an expert here)- the pictures look crisp and detailed which is important to me as mostly I take my kids pictures with my phone.2.  The battery life of this phone is much better.  It can last me the whole day.  At 10 pm I still have 30% battery and I was on my phone a lot- mostly browsing but did watch a little youtube also.3. Screen size is bigger on this phone- if you are looking to put it in a pocket this may be a bit big.  Since I carry it in my purse I don't mind, and I kind of enjoy the big screen for my youtube habit.  Picture quality when watching video seems superior also.4. Bloatware apps- annoying.  The pixel definitely felt way cleaner out of the gate.  On this phone I had to delete a lot of apps and then disable or hide away in folders others that can't be deleted.  In the end it's not a dealbreaker for me, but it created some pain in the initial setup of the phone.5.  This phone has facial recognition, but it hasn't been working that great for me.  I will probably try to go in and redo it and see if it improves at all.  It would be nice if it worked- but mostly I am using the fingerprint sensor.  I actually preferred the physical fingerprint sensor on the back of the pixel because it worked consistently, and the one built into the screen on this phone seems a bit finnicky.  Overall this one has more ""advanced"" unlock features but I preferred the reliability on the pixel.I know this comparison is only so good because Pixel already has a 4a and soon a 5a, but maybe it will help someone.  Overall I am happy because I got a nice camera, great battery life, and nice video quality on a mid range phone.  The Amazon renewed phone had no defects at all that I could tell.  I don't think the charger with it was original, but it was certainly worth the savings for the renewed price.One more tip- I hated the Samsung keyboard for some reason.  So I downloaded the google Gboard on it which made me much happier.","August 14, 2021"

My previous phone had one on the back side which was much more convenient and quicker to activate because the screen must first be turned on, then hold the phone in the other hand and place a finger precisely on the fingerprint reader. Restarting the phone is holding two buttons simultaneously for at least 5 seconds, or longer. And, answering a call means sliding the green button rather than just pressing it.

I was expecting a cracked screen, or just an all around beat up phone. However that's not the case. The frame and back are in excellent condition, the screen has some scratches but the phone is in way better shape than I expected all around. So I'm definitely happy with my purchase. Love the oled display, it's pretty fast too. The only thing that I was confused about was the title listed that it was a Tmobile/Sprint unlocked device. The one I received was an AT&T unlocked phone. Not a big issue as it works for t-mobile. When I powered it on the first time I thought I was going to have to send it back as it turns on with AT&T's carrier logo. The battery health is at 100% so it looks as though this phone will work for the 4 months that I'll need it until I get the cash saved up for another s23 ultra. I will say this to everyone that sells Amazon Renewed = Pack the phones better when you're shipping them out please. Mine was loose in the box","November 17, 2023"

Because Amazon Renewed does not provide any support but provides only the option to return the item or keep it, I decided to just use the face recognition feature and learn my lesson, don't trust Amazon Renewed to restore any product to anything close to the original.","July 13, 2023"

I babied it. Now I find that the notification icons on the top, and the file operations on the bottom have left in a faint burn-in that's only going to get worse with time. Way to go Samsung.

I took the phone to a local Verizon store on May 1st 2022 (not a Verizon reseller) and the sales woman who helped me there was great.  I saw other reviewers that said they had issues getting it connected to Verizon's network.  The phone has 2 sim card slots one for CDMA and one for GSM.  You need to make sure the Verizon sim card is in the appropriate sim slot in order to get the phone to connect.  The GSM slot (AT&T's network) was actually easier to get to as it was on top, and we had to try both slots to figure out which one was the correct CDMA slot.  If you are working with Verizon and the phone doesn't connect, make sure you try both sim slots.","May 6, 2022"
3601,SAMSUNG Electronics Galaxy,Amazon Customer,5,"This is an industrial grade phone with a user replaceable battery and there may be some sacrifices in the features to achieve that level of durability. There appear to be 4 different versions of this phone in the US. The SM-G715A is ATT only and is currently listed on the ATT website as compatible. The SM-G715V is Verizon only. The SM-G715U is supposed to be unlocked but ATT does not currently list it as compatible on their website. It is supposed to work on Verizon. This might account for some of the problems that have been reported. It is also possible that the 3G shutdown last year caused problems for any phone, carrier or plan still using it. The SM-G715U1 is factory unlocked with no carrier specific bloatware on the one I received. I put a Page Plus Verizon MVNO SIM into it and it immediately started working with no trouble. ATT specifically lists the U1 model (but not the U) as compatible with ATT but I have not tried it. I ran the IMEI against the T-Mobile compatibility checker and it showed compatible but have not tried it. None of the Galaxy Xcover PRO models appear to be compatible with Spectrum Mobile available only to Spectrum internet customers. Although Spectrum advertises a BYOD option and runs on Verizon, they only accept a limit number of higher end phones and this isn't one of them. Bottom line seems to be if you want an XCover PRO that is compatible with most providers and carriers, get the U1 model but check with your cell provider first. You might have to pay a little extra for this one. If you only need Verizon or ATT you might save money with the carrier specific ""V"" or ""A"" versions or even the ""U"" version for Verizon. The factory box should be marked with the model and you can always check the ""About Phone"" option under ""Settings""  for the exact model if there are problems activating. Running the IMEI against the provider or carrier's website or contacting your provider and have them check it should also work but of course you have to have the phone in hand to do either one. When buying a phone off the internet, the option to return it if it doesn't work or is not as advertised is something to consider.","March 24, 2023"
3602,SAMSUNG Electronics Galaxy,Steve,1,"So this phone is unlocked and does require a little navigating to get it to work on ATT. Make sure Sims is in the right slot #1. Link it to the proper network, information on Google how to. This is not like your active phone if that is what you are hoping but is an OK replacement.So after a week I'm changing my review, this phone is junk, trash, on par with Trac phone, but less quality. These so called ""new"" phones are used did not even clear the history or delete previous files (super sorry Debra hope you man gets over his porn addiction) cashe completely full. Want maps better buy one. 4gLTE on this device is dial-up my samsung galaxy active8 is faster in same location and has not been updated in 18months. Don't worry about an otter box ships back to Amazon just fine the way it is. From 4 stars when first started to 1 after a week, did I mention deleting files? Debra don't throw stones in a glass house your porn was still in history. Third week in they misspelled POS and put PRO slightly better than a Trac phone until u turn the Trac phone on then blows this phone out of the water. Nonstop network resets and contact losses are what u pay for.","May 21, 2022"

3605,SAMSUNG Electronics Galaxy,Susan,5,"This model is older but includes updates from the 6 pro, like the headphone jack. I absolutely love this phone! Might not have 5G, but neither does most of the places I actually travel to in the states. Willing to bet this phone will definitely last me until 5G is a commonplace as 4G is now, then I'll upgrade to the 6 Pro that includes it at a steep discount like this new XCOVER Pro was. $300 for a more than capable, durable and stylish phone. Some reviews are misleading, wireless charging is not included on this model but is very easily(and hella cheaply) added. The back plate is removable with just a finger nail so adding wireless charging, a new extended battery or just dealing in an extra battery for power when charging is unavailable is very easy. Very durable and ip68 rated so a great first phone for your kids or great for us clumsy folk that are 30-40+yr old kids.","November 15, 2022"
3606,SAMSUNG Electronics Galaxy,Good phone it,3,"A quick summary to start: The phone itself is 4 stars. The lying about shipping and being available is a 1 star, thus the 3 star average (rounded up).I have this phone and have had it for years. The phone overall was great.Pros:- Durable (gets dropped a lot, even from height). It is in a case, but even so it has been dropped out of the case a couple times. I would say some of the falls it has had would've shattered any other phone.- The replacement battery is nice for when out-and-about and don't have an additional power bank on me. The extra battery is smaller than a power bank and easier to have on me.- The fingerprint reader is quick and responsive.- The speed and responsiveness overall is good. It even handles running multiple apps at a time well (either split screen or window in window).- Works good in the rain and with gloves.Cons:- Screen is barely visible in the daylight. Sometimes even in shady areas it is faint.- It is considered a business phone, so trying to get one through Verizon (or AT&T) is difficult to say the least.I had purchased this one as I finally dropped my current xCover Pro one time too many. It still works, but there is a loose connection now on the inside for the display and requires a clamp to keep the screen on. If the clamp is not in the exact place, it will not properly respond to any input. It cannot be fixed by the typical iFixIt shops because it is the 'active' version of the phone and there is no access (at least that is what the people at the iFixIt shops told me). I figured the price was right for a replacement and It stated I could get it the next day with Prime, so even better.So I order this one 2 days ago and it said it would be here yesterday. Then yesterday it said it would be today. Now it is saying Friday?!?!? Don't state that I can get something tomorrow or the next day if it is going to take 5+ days to get here (if not delayed even more). That is a cheap bait-and-switch tactic. Unfortunately I cannot cancel this order for some reason until after Friday, which means I am also out the money to get another replacement phone.Again, I would still recommend this phone to be used in rugged environments. As with any phone though, you should still use a case and screen protector. Rugged is only so rugged after all. I would not buy the phone from here unless your phone isn't currently broken and you don't need a quick replacement. If you can wait a week (or more) then sure, go ahead and order from here. This listing should not say that it can arrive next day as it does currently.","November 2, 2022"

Returned that phone and turned around and ordered this particular one. That same day, I got a notice in teh mail from Verizon that this phone would no longer be supported on their network beginning sometime near teh end of December 2022.

Unfortunately, even in an Otterbox case the phone screen shattered when it fell about 2.5 feet. After contacting Amazon, I was advised to go through Samsung, which I did. I was told, via telephone, that it was under warranty. We bought the phone in May 2022 and it's now September 2022; so, yes it is still under warranty.  Unfortunately, Samsung determined they aren't honoring their warranty and wanted to charge me $157 to repair the phone. I refused to pay it because the phone is still under warranty, we have it in an OtterBox case, it is touted as a rugged phone with a Gorilla Glass screen and we're still paying for the phone.  I requested to speak with a supervisor, was told one would return my call in 24 hours but that never happened.  The phone was returned to me unrepaired. I have been a fan of Samsung phones for many years. I will NEVER buy ANY Samsung products ever again.

3641,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,userNO12345,5,"I jumped on the 512GB pre-order deal that Amazon had and have used the phone for the past month or so.  I really like this phone coming from a conventional handset.  Some of my ideal phone criteria are:- Compact device- Mainstream/higher end performance- DurabilityHere is why this phone works for me.- Size:  My previous phone was S10e.  Yes it was old but I liked the compact size compared to many larger phones these days.  Even the standard S24 is bigger.  Although it is thicker, I like the fact that it fits in my pocket comfortably.- Performance:  It has the latest processor, 512GB of storage and 12 gig of memory.  The camera is now on par with other premium devices and now is truly considered a flagship device.  All good.- Durability:  Don't get me wrong...  The flip phone will probably never be as durable as a conventional handset, but the Z flip now has dust protection in addition to moisture protection.  Now that Samsung has gone through several life cycles, I feel comfortable using the fold devices.- Price:  People complain that the price went up by $100.  There are deals to be had and ways to bring down the price.Summary:My old S10e did pretty much everything that newer phones do in terms of the features. including wireless pay and reverse charging.  The only reason for me to look for a new phone was to address the failing (aging) battery.  As it is a good time for me to look for a new device, I wanted to considering something different and new.  The Z flip added the folding ""trick"", and it is a welcoming change.  One, I can mostly triage messages and etc on the cover screen and minimize the big screen.  Two, the main screen, because of its oddly long aspect ratio, works pretty well working with 2 separate windows.  It is very useful.  I like the new form factor and the functions that it adds.","August 19, 2024"

But I think there's stuff that runs in the background. The phone gets super hot. I used a super fashion charger and the phone gets hot. I used a wireless charger and the phone feels like a coal. I used a thermometer and it was in my locker player music on Bluetooth.  It was 105... everything else was 82. So that's kinda concerning. Outside of that. I like it. I may change my mind if the thing burns down my house or something.","September 4, 2024"
3643,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,userNO12345,5,"I recently got the SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Flip 6 AI Cell Phone with 256GB of storage, and it has been an amazing upgrade. Here’s my personal take on this innovative device:Design and BuildThe first thing that struck me was the sleek and stylish design. The folding mechanism is smooth and feels incredibly robust. When folded, it’s compact and fits perfectly in my pocket, making it super convenient to carry around. Unfolding it reveals a gorgeous, vibrant display that’s perfect for everything from browsing to watching videos.DisplayThe main display is stunning. It’s bright, colorful, and the flexible screen is just so cool to use. Watching videos and scrolling through apps is a delightful experience. Plus, the secondary display on the outside is handy for quickly checking notifications, time, and other essential information without having to open the phone.PerformancePerformance-wise, this phone is a beast. The AI features are impressive, making the phone feel incredibly responsive and intuitive. Whether I’m multitasking, gaming, or using demanding apps, everything runs smoothly without any hiccups. The 256GB of storage is more than enough for all my apps, photos, videos, and files. I don’t have to worry about running out of space, which is a huge plus.CameraThe camera setup is another highlight. The photos and videos are crisp, clear, and vibrant, even in low light. The foldable design allows for some creative photography angles and hands-free selfies, which I’ve been having a lot of fun with.Battery LifeBattery life is pretty solid. It easily lasts me through a full day of heavy use, and the fast charging is a lifesaver when I need a quick boost. I haven’t had any issues with battery performance, which is always a concern with high-end smartphones.User ExperienceUsing the Galaxy Z Flip 6 feels futuristic. The interface is user-friendly, and the AI integration helps with daily tasks, making everything feel seamless. I also appreciate the customization options that let me tweak the phone to my preferences.DurabilityOne thing I was initially worried about was the durability of the foldable screen. However, after using it for a while, I can say that it feels sturdy and well-built. I’m careful with it, of course, but it doesn’t feel fragile.Final ThoughtsOverall, I’m extremely happy with the SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Flip 6 AI Cell Phone. It’s a perfect blend of cutting-edge technology and stylish design. The foldable aspect is more than just a gimmick—it’s a functional feature that adds real value to the user experience. If you’re looking for something innovative and powerful, this phone is definitely worth considering.","August 5, 2024"

It doesnt have the 100x magnification like my Ultra but.the camera is still awesome.However the inside part can scratch easily but it does come with a screen protector.The scratch in the screen protector does not affect the performance.

Model phone in-store had it as well. Discovered it is not physical damage but a quality assurance/ software issue from Samsung. After purchasing it directly from Samsung's site, I was sent to a store for pick-up, and the store sold it significantly cheaper only a day later.

3662,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Amazon Customer,4,"I am new to Samsung phones and after owning this Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 AI Cell Phone for several days I was finally ready to switch over from my old iPhone.Spectrum refuses to activate this phone because it was not financed through them.I read the sales page and I see no mention that before purchase a buyer should check with their mobile service provider to see if they can even use this phone.When I asked the Spectrum representative when they might be ready to activate this Samsung Fold he could not provide me with a date.Since I cannot add this phone to my current mobile plan, I am not able to review it as a phone.This mobile phone to be sold barebones, it just incudes a C type charging cable, but, as a new Samsung user, I really needed a new user bundle. Since this phone does not include a wall charger, I had to scramble to find a way to charge it.I'd prefer that anxiety not be a part of my new user experience!This phone comes with the bare minimum of instructions. I would like that a full new user guide be included in my desired new user bundle!Since the minimalist instructions did not mention how to actually fold this Fold, I had to take a risk and bend it like...I might be about to break it. Thankfully it bent folded very easily!This Z Flip 6 is about as wide as my iPhone SE, which I can now no longer call my 'old"" phone. Since Spectrum won't activate this new one it has now been reinstated as just my plain old ""phone"". I like that the width of this new Fold is about the same as my SE because I do not have to relearn how to hold this new phone.I like that this phone folds because I am accustomed to storing my SE in a small outer pocket of my purse. When folded this Flip can fit into the same pocket.This Z Flip 6 seems to suck down it's battery life at about 1% per hour when fully opened, however, it charges very quickly. I am not an expert on mobile phones so it's entirely possible that something that I have running is causing the rapid loss of battery life.I had another small bout with anxiety when I decided to see how my music sounded on this Fold. Without a user's manual I had to look on the internet to see where my music went. I learned that my music files went to You Tube music. I love You Tube so that was okay with me. My music sounds great on this phone!I am disappointed that I cannot currently use this Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 AI Cell Phone as my mobile phone unless I am willing to sign up with another mobile carrier and get a new phone number and have two mobile phones. No thanks.I think that the sales page for this and for all mobile phones should include a warning to check with your mobile carrier before purchase. Since this Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 AI Cell Phone does not carry that warning I am deducting one star from my review.Four stars.","July 29, 2024"
3663,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Dil rai,4,"The SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Flip 6 AI Cell Phone I received for review did not come with a sim card and me being technologically challenged as I am, did not know I needed one to activate and to connect the phone to my cellular plan and be able to make phone calls (every phone I have owned came with one already installed or was preinstalled for me when I purchased it). This does come with 2 slots for nano cards, just be careful when you place the card in the phone, you must use the tray or else the card will just fall into the phone and is almost impossible to get out without professional help.After spending an afternoon at the Samsung store, they finally were able to get my sim card out and showed me the proper way to install it (using the tray) and since the phone comes unlocked, I was able to go to my provider afterwords and easily add the phone to my plan.  The phone itself works and looks great and is loaded with some nice new features previously unavailable to the older versions. I ended up doing what I normally do with new technology and just play around with it to learn things on my own, since the included directions are the bare minimum to get started. I have not been through all the features, but the ones I have messed around with work great, like the live translator, just point the smaller screen to the person you are trying to talk too, and it will translate the language onto the main screen you are looking at. I can see this coming in very handy to people who like to travel. I have tested this feature out with my mother speaking Italian and the translation was good enough to understand what she was saying, not verbatim, but good enough to get the point across.  The app does not come installed on the phone but is free to download and it supports 17 languages that I have seen listed. The other feature I have messed around with is the camera and by using the smaller screen you are able to see the picture you are taking as you are taking it which is great if you are into selfies. I am not a big phone user and do not always have my face buried in one, so I am not constantly flipping the phone open and closed, and even the way that I use it, the main screen still has developed a slightly more noticeable crease at the fold point, and this is only my 2nd full day using it. I guess I can always just use the smaller screen on the outside of the phone, instead of opening and closing it, to help mitigate the crease. You can customize the smaller screen to access almost every app and function on the phone to include the ability to send messages without ever having to flip open the phone. Overall, once I finally got the phone up and running it is a great phone that I am more than happy with. I have only used it for 2 full days and will update my review if I should encounter any unexpected problems with it. I really wish they would put sticker warnings on things like use tray to install card and I could have saved myself an afternoon.","July 31, 2024"
3664,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,secretsoftheuniverse,4,"For those that like a foldable phone, the mechanics are super solid.  I genuinely LOVE the fingerprint reader located on the side power button. It makes unlocking the phone a breeze and in my month or two of using it, it has been a flawless process. The phone itself is very attractive and eye catching (have gotten multiple comments on it at work). The folding mechanic in conjunction with Google Translate can make for a very helpful experience when travelling. The Samsung Galaxy/Android user experience was very nice, no complaints. Camera was pretty much on par with previous Pixel phones in my experience.The phone is generally much more sensitive to dirt/sand due to folding mechanics (be very careful at the beach!) While not horrible, the actual fold crease in the screen is a bit annoying especially if you watch a lot of media on your phone the way I do. Screen seems to have more glare than previous smartphone (I believe this is due to the foldable screen protector) and it always just looks a little lumpy in the middle of the screen when you have it fully open.Ability to add apps to home screen is very helpful (although it requires an additional app that doesn't come default with the phone) but, otherwise, the limited amount of dedicated widgets for the cover screen was a bit disappointing. The AI features while potentially fun, really didn't seem to use much of a functional purpose to me, but might appeal to a younger user.  It does get points for being much more comfortable in my pocket and being very compact.Ultimately, I think if you are not bothered by the fold in the screen because you don't watch movies on your phone regularly and you are looking for an ultra compact phone with all the bells and whistles, this is a great option for you.","August 31, 2024"
3665,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Chris S,4,"It's been awhile since I've used a flip phone, my first flip phone was a StarTac, then I've used the very first Motorola Razon back in the 90s and this is my first flip phone since then... very nostalgic! Okay that's enough of reminiscing and now to the pros and cons of this phone. Keep in mind I'm upgrading from an old Samsung S10+.PROS:*TMobile 5G UC (ultra capacity) Network Up to 10GB/second for data. Internet speed is way faster than my old 4G connectivity.*Button Fingerprint reader, no more on screen fingerprint reading. Very responsive and accurate. Now that the fingerprint reader is on the button I'm wondering why it took them so long to do this. If my screen is damaged on my S10 I will not be able to access any of my apps that uses biometrics which happened to me recently.*4000mAH battery can go the distance. Been using this phone for a week and the battery has been able to last the whole day with average use of the phone and not having to have it plugged in all the time.CONS:* No expandable memory card slot only built in 256GB or 512GB internal memory. I'm so use to having an expandable memory card slot that I'm kinda sad that Samsung didn't include one with this phone. After transferring everything from my old phone to new phone I only have 15gb of memory left... time to transfer old pics and vids off to my laptop.*Will not work with existing car mount charger. Need to move phone up 2-3 inches. Not a problem at the moment since all I need to do is move the phone a bit higher on my car mount charger which works with wireless charging. I'm looking into a magsafe car mount but need to get a magsafe case which I'm not willing to do at this point. I'm loving my SUPCASE which fits perfectly with this phone.*Folding display does not show crease when display is on, only shows when  screen is completely off. This is not a problem when screen is on you don't really notice it. What one would expect from a folding screen.","August 9, 2024"
3666,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,DynomiteWins,4,"This review is for the SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Flip 6 AI Cell Phone, 256GB Unlocked Android Smartphone.This is my first full screen flip phone. I like the small size when folded, but don't think being able to fold it makes it worth the price. I wonder how long the inside screen will last where it folds. Samsung offers a one time $200 interior screen replacement warranty within 2 years to the original owner so that's a plus although $200 is still a lot.Folded the phone is about 3.25in x 2.75in x 0.75in. The front cover screen is nice. When locked/asleep, if there is a text or notification received it shows a small red dot to let you know. You have to wake the screen up and unlock it to see the notification, or even what kind of notification it was which is kind of a pain.Once unlocked, I have it set to see notifications if I swipe right. There are also limited basic apps that offer widgets for the cover screen such as calendar, calculator, clock, contacts, samsung gallery, phone calls, reminders, weather, voice recorder, news, health etc.  The phone widget allows me to add 4 contacts that I can speed dial without unfolding the phone. The only apps currently available on the cover screen are Google maps, messages, Netflix, WhatsApp and YouTube.When unfolded, the phone is a little skinner than my old Galaxy A53. I'd like the screen a little wider, but maybe I just have to get used to it more. The screen also has a different, plasticky feel to it since it is not glass.Other than that, you can find and read about the specs and features online. I find it to be a very good phone. I just don't think one needs to spend so much to get a good quality phone.","August 6, 2024"
3667,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,MAI TRAC MARYNIAK,4,"I ordered this phone for my partner as the battery on her Pixel was bulging for the 2nd time.  She wasn't a big fan of the Google phone and had like Samsung's in the past so I thought we would try this one.  The phone feels substantial and very solid in the hand, with crisp, easy to use buttons for volume.  The battery life so are has been very good which is important since we live in an area where coverage can be spotty.  It also works with the variety of Qi wireless chargers we have in our home and office.  Not sure all that sure about the folding feature? It makes the phone into a compact little square, but also then thicker and I don;t see how that is an advantage when in the pocket, other than protecting the main screen?  Speaking of the main screen, my partner has folded the phone a few times and when you unfold it there is a ripple or slight crease in the screen when you first open it.  It does seem to relax fairly quickly once open, but as many other reviews have mentioned this looks to be a point of failure for the future.  My partner doesn't care about the phone being folded and just keeps it flat all the time.  The screen is about 1/2"" longer than her pixel was so its not noticeably bigger if it's in your pocket.  She has been using the voice activated features and has found that to be convenient.  The phone learned her voice quite easily with repeating a group of phrases as part of the set up and hasn't misunderstood anything since.  Overall a decent phone so far and will update this review as time goes on, if anything noteworthy arises or changes.","August 1, 2024"
3668,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,MAI TRAC MARYNIAK,4,"I have owned many foldable phones, because I do believe that in a sea of bar shaped phones, foldables  are a breath of fresh air!I'll be honest, the Google pixel fold is by far the best foldable out there. You get a great camera, the smoothest software and a big cover screen. With that being said, the Z Flip 6 with its vibrant colors & sturdy frame is one of the best looking phones and the form factor is so comfy to hold, put in your pocket or your purse.The cover screen is very useful, I find myself trying to use it most of the time, the main screen is also beautiful and brighter than last year.Everything is quick and all the apps run perfectly. Making calls and hanging up by closing the flip is still fun after all these years since the original flips!Overall I enjoyed using the phone for everyday use.Now to the really bad part which takes at least 1 star off my rating and it's the cameras! The selfie camera is a joke and shouldn't be allowed on a phone with that price.The main camera, with 50 mega pixels, is barely performing even in bright light outdoors.  I would expect it to be on par with most middle of the line phones  out there, but the pixel line kicks its butt and so does the iPhone pro!The battery was just slightly better than last year, barely making it to the end of the day, most likely will need a second charge later in the day with moderate or slightly heavy phone use.Overall, I like the phone, I would pull the trigger only if you really don't care about the camera, everything else about the phone is fun!","July 29, 2024"
3669,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Jever,4,"Ever since getting this phone, I have been obsessed. I love how sleek it looks this year as I have always preferred the matte look for the sides and back glass. Its design, the confident clap when it closes, and guaranteed 7 years of updates make me confident in the long term support. I was having so much fun taking pictures of and with the flip6. I wish they would have done a couple things different, mainly the outer screen should have been much bigger, even keeping the file shape since it might become a visually distinctive calling card. Honestly the bezels on the cover screen should be halved at least. The buttons on mine also feel like they are loose and can move sides to side :( . I have a genuine hope that the screen and hinge are more durable so I don't have to invoke the insurance. More importantly, I think the performance is great I can play any game I want and I'll put it on all the highest settings, multitasking with the extra height makes using multiple apps a better experience, and the improved camera hardware make excellent images. I'm getting more comfortable using the phone like a camcorder when I record video, it's so cool. Flex mode gives the phone great remote photo options, i want better uses for when the phone is standing like a tent. I  love this phone and highly recommend it especially where carrier offers are good.","August 4, 2024"
3670,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Carl J,5,"Going from a much more traditional approx. $200.00 Android phone to the Samsung Galaxy Flip 6 SHOULD be considered a major upgrade, and I was not disappointed. I was very attracted to the significant uptick in photographic quality and honestly was not thinking in terms of the other features, but mostly those are wining me over too.Up front I'm gonna say this, and I may be in the minority here, but I have absolutely zero idea what the cover screen is for. Literally. I can't fathom why it's there. It offers no additional functionality, and mostly seems to be there to look impressive, but to unlock its full capacity (which apparently CAN be done) you have to jump thru a few hoops via online tutorials, and then what have you got? A tiny little screen on the flip side of a much larger and much better screen. So there... that's my one gripe.So, let's talk about the big screen. It's sizable and bright, it has excellent refresh rate, so it moves relatively seamlessly. Scrolling is effortless, and gameplay (of which I do NOT do much...) seems to work very nicely, without lag. There is a slightly noticeable bump in the center at the fold, but that's endemic to the nature of the beast, and it's something you learn rapidly to not be phased by.  It's ultra-widescreen, so viewing in landscape mode pretty much any movie is enjoyable. Go ahead and put on Lawrence of Arabia, it fits!!! And THAT'S a wiiiide screen movie.Video is also a particular joy here. The camera shoots at 4K (I believe that can be adjusted downward if need be) and offers a good, crisp image. The photos attached to the review of water splashing onto rocks are still-frames from the video. Nearly the equal to my Nikon D3400 camera. Low light video looks pretty sharp as well, with minimal grain and excellent blacks. Oh, and this is kind of a weird thing, the sound recording is surprisingly sharp. I don't recall ever having a phone capable of capturing even remotely decent sound, dooming some videos I'd hope to cherish for a long time.I am enjoying a resurgence in flying R/C vehicles and I can tell you this phone has greatly improved the quality of app-connection for wi-fi based drone apps. Of the seven drones I had that would not work on my previous phone only one has not been greatly improved by switching to the Flip 6.I won't lie, there is one other mini-gripe, and that's the AI photo-to art generator. Impressively awkwardly un-recognizable toon versions of myself are cute, and, let's face it, an upgrade from the source image, but if I posted approximately 80 % of them, I've tried no one would have a clue who it was supposed to be. In a couple of them I came out looking surprisingly like a curly haired Mr. Incredible.I didn't expect to love this guy, but it's really grown on me. I love that it folds up and fits neatly in my shirt pocket, I love that it feels rugged and capable, and I love that it works so well.Oh yeah, it also makes and receives phone calls. This is a seldom-mentioned aspect of the Flip 6.I really do love this new phone, and I expect to use it a great deal in my artistic ventures. and THAT is the best compliment I can give it.","August 11, 2024"
3671,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,userNO12345,4,"After several revisions of the Flip phones, I figured Samsung would have solved the crease issue.  It's as apparent as ever.The formfactor is nifty, but I had the feeling of the crease when using the phone, Seeing it is disappointing as well.  No DEX support (WHY?), and missing features the huge Fold6 has.Seems to get good coverage, and works as expected.  I was able to apply a tmobile prepaid eSim to the phone for the duration of my tests and I was very happy with the service and performance.Camera isn't that impressive compared to other >$1000 phones.At the end of the day, I'll go back to my Ultra S22.","August 17, 2024"
3672,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Amazon Customer,5,"I have never had a flip phone before (unless you count the really old non-smart versions - now I'm dating myself), however this SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Flip 6 AI Cell Phone might just convert me. There are so many advancements I'll touch on just a few given I'm still learning a great deal about this phone.I have been using a Galaxy S22 for the past 2 years and have loved the size and features, particularly the excellent cameras. The Flip 6 unfolded is longer with a 6.7"" screen, and just a smidge wider. If you look really hard at the screen from the side, you can see a very slight bump where the crease is when folded open. However once something is on the screen, I do not notice it at all. The display is truly beautiful. The resolution of 425 ppi makes for a very sharp image on screen. Super easy to read text. The colors on the screen really pop. Given the longer aspect, watching a movie on the screen does not get much bigger than my S22 since the aspect is a wider format. Perhaps cinematic movies will make use of the full display. Speaking of displays, there is a half sized display on the back of the phone (front of the phone when folded closed). Clarity on this smaller screen is excellent as well. It seems to have full functionality as the inside screen. You will want a protective screen cover for this outer screen since it is likely to get scratched otherwise. That includes getting protection for the 2 protuding lenses as well. Note that no screen cover can go on the folded screen for obvious reasons.For cameras, I have been told many times that the color of the photos I have taken with my S22 is better than nearly all others. So I did a comparison with my new Flip 6. Since the resolution on the main camera is 50 MP, the sharpness and detail of the pictures is incredible. The colors are slightly different, but I found it to be slightly more realistic than my S22. You can also set some enhancement defaults to help bring out the best in your photos right from the start.I won't bother to talk about the transition of one phone to another as that is not unique to this phone. It was however quite seamless as I anticipated.The phone came with zero charge on it. I charged it with a super fast charger and it was impressive. Within 15 to 20 minutes, it has gone from 0 to 60 percent. (Sounds like car stats).So far I am liking this phone a great deal. Currently there is a fantastic deal on Amazon so don't wait long.","August 1, 2024"
3673,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,kwillia,5,"I have always been a Samsung user, and I have my Samsung 22+ to compare with  this new Galaxy Flip 6.  The first thing I noticed was the fingerprint security lock.  This has been vastly improved and works in a split second, once you set it up.  It was pretty quick to set up, too.This is important because I end up using it repeatedly, and it turns out to be a real timesaver.Of course, I was excited about my new cellphone, but I was also concerned about the migration process.  Possibly because I migrated from a Samsung, to a Samsung, it went quickly and easily.  I had an enormous amount of saved photos and videos, and it swapped them all over without a problem.  It did take about 90 minutes, though.This screen is beautiful, and there is a barely noticeable little raised area in the middle of the screen where you bend it.  It opens and closes easily, and using it in the bent position (""flex mode"") gives you some extra camera options, such as setting it on the table to film without a tripod.Speaking of the camera, focus, lighting etc. is well automated and it takes great shots.  I don't think you can do much better.  There are some AI additions to help you edit your photos and portraits, if you are into that.  The auto frame feature seems to be a thoughtful addition.I found the sound quality to be great, and the bluetooth worked fine after pairing with my  separate JBL speaker.  I also invested in the (new) Ultra watch, which was equally easy to set up on this phone.This phone takes a SIM card, and I installed my T-Mobile Sim card without any problems.  I am also able to make WiFi calls easily.Being a new phone, it is very fast and handles all my apps just fine (They all transferred over).  It plugs into my Dodge Challenger seamlessly, and runs Google maps just fine while I drive.My experience thus far has been simply wonderful.  It's easy to highly recommend this phone, and with the deals out there, the time is right!","August 9, 2024"
3674,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,JDL Reviews,5,"Die-hard iPhone user here. Never thought I’d even bother with another brand of phone after a few attempts with Samsung 10-ish years ago. But then they had to go and make something cool.In many respects, it’s quite impressive. The screen resolution is amazingly crisp and color-saturated. The seamless way the unfolded screen fits together is darn-near alien tech. And I like that, when folded, it saves space in purse and pocket. It’s also pretty neat to be able to check notifications without unfolding.But, there are some things I wasn’t fond of. For one thing, running all those beautiful screens really takes a toll on the battery. I was at 50% before I’d barely blinked! To its credit, it does charge quickly, but who wants to factor in recharging while out and about? Speaking of charging, if this phone is your first purchase ever, you will need to buy an outlet block. All you get is the cord. Depends how you plan to charge, though, I guess. A final thought about the screens- I still have massive angst that something stupid will scratch them, even with the included screen protector film.I was also looking forward to the new camera and processor, but only one of those impressed me. There were times when the phone lagged, rather than zoomed. Not sure why. The camera is great-to a point. As long as you don’t need true macro capability, it’s impressive. Clear images and great color.Overall, it‘s the best attempt at replacing my iPhone. I’ll leave you hanging with whether or not it actually did. But that doesn’t really matter. Ultimately, you have to try it for yourself.","September 2, 2024"
3675,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,JDL Reviews,5,"Just as a little background, I moved from a Galaxy S22 Ultra to this phone.  As to size, this phone appears to be a tiny bit longer when opened and a tiny bit thinner since the 22 Ultra has curved edges on the side.  I liked the stylus/pen in the Ultra, but I did not use it enough to really matter in the switch.  One of the main reasons I decided to switch is the size of this phone when folded.  Some manufacturers have started making pockets bigger, but many have not and I would often find the edge of my phone sticking out of my pocket. This is an invitation for hitting it on something.  This phone folds up easily and fits in any pocket without that worry.  Samsung installs a screen protector on the main/large screen from the factory which I thought was a nice bonus, but you will want to get a protector for the outer screen since it is touched all the time even when  the phone is opened to full size.  As far as specs go, this phone has the same basic features as the S22 Ultra; wireless charging, great cameras, good processing speeds, and good memory (unless you use your phone as a video camera or take tons of pictures everyday).  The sound quality from the speakers is a bit better than the 22 Ultra IMO.  I have had no problems with Wi-Fi or BT connections.  We have 5G AT&T signal in this area, and there have been zero problems with that.  The call quality is great; just as the Ultra.  So far I am really impressed with this ""little"" phone.  A couple of things to note: 1.  If you are moving from another Samsung, be sure to use the SmartSwitch app.  It moves everything over.  You may have to sign into some accounts again since it is a different device, but the accounts/apps are moved.  I use Microsoft Launcher for easier access to MS apps (outlook, word, and Excel) and easier custom display settings instead of the standard Samsung UI so I cannot speak to any differences there, but can say the MS Launcher has worked flawlessly so far.  2. This is an unlocked phone so you can use it on any carrier that uses a SIM.  If your carrier will not activate the phone, that is on the carrier, not the phone since it WILL work.  NO it does not come with a SIM, those are supplied by your service provider as they are network specific.  Yes there is a SIM tray to move it over.  I was half drunk when I switched it over and only had to reposition the card twice to get it to slide back in (those tiny rascals are hard to get just right).  After that SmartSwitch took everything over when launched and it was smooth sailing from there.  3. Wireless charging and Super Fast charging have both worked as expected on all of our ""old"" chargers.  4.  The ""Always On Display"" does drain the battery since the screen is always on, but it is not a big drain.  Very similar if not the same as the Ultra.  Come on man, even if it were as high as 1%/hr, that would be 100 hours from full charge.  I can go 2 days of full usage (calls/data/cam/etc) without recharging and possibly more.  I just don't like my phone to get below 40% so I charge it back up.  There are many features I have not tried yet that were not available on the 22 Ultra, but I will get to them and update the review as necessary.  This is just an early review so it may be updated even without trying other ""new"" features.  At first I was not sure about switching, but am not glad I did.  If you are moving from an Ultra/Note and are used to having the pen and used it a lot, this may not be for you.  If that is the case, you should look at the Galaxy Fold.  The main reason I did not go with the Fold is that the phone size/pocket fit would have been the same as the Ultra.  So far I have not looked back once and am glad I made the switch.","August 4, 2024"
3676,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Jocko,5,"Samsung flip 6 is really a great phone! I got the mint green color phone and it's a cool color but I did put a case on it. I wasn't sure how I would feel about the flip feature but I actually really like it and how it is so much easier to fit in my pocket. I added a picture that compares it to my old samsung s9 plus and they are essentially the same size. I can feel a slight crease in the middle of the phone and in certain light I can see it, but truthfully, I don't even really notice it anymore and it's not a big deal to me the phone performs so well it is a non issue. I do need to use both hands to flip the phone open or to grip the top with my right hand, so it's not like it's just going to flop open on you. The battery lasts me all day with some pretty heavy use, playing games and using social media. It's does take a little while to charge but I'm not sure if that's the phone or the cord I'm using. It can be charged wireless as well. The camera is awesome and takes amazing pictures, and even the front camera when the phone is closed is awesome. I haven't extensively tried it yet but the translate feature is pretty cool. I could see how it could be helpful traveling. All in all I really like this phone and think it is a great buy. The only super slight almost miniscule thing that I wish but you can't use with this phone is an S pen, but I can live without my pen for a phone that can so easily do so much more and fold and fit in my pocket.","August 4, 2024"
3677,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,L S,5,"I love this phone's camera! It's superior to my Pixel 8 pro. I also like that the smaller lens window makes it less likely to fingerprint. The photo of the goats in action is with the main camera.The glass on the front makes me worry about breakage but I love the selfie features it allows and when I tried it for translation I was surprised how well it worked with Japanese. I also love that you can use it to check notifications without opening the phone.This has a nice small profile and is comfortable to carry because of the smaller size when folded. It's sleek and looks nice. I don't love that the screen shows a groove but it's not really noticable except when taking photos in certain lighting. It also runs hotter than I expected, though that doesn't seen to slow it down.I am thinking to get a wallet or bag for it since there aren't cases that protect the back of the hinge from drops and I have issues with grip. Aside from that it feels pretty durable and I read good things about how the screen holds up on previous models.I'm less thrilled with the built-in AI features, but that's a personal thing. I got it for use as a camcorder and it has a lot of features for that.","August 3, 2024"
3678,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Redacted c,5,"I absolutely love this Galaxy Z Flip6 phone in the gorgeous mint color! It fits in many of my pockets when folded without sacrificing screen size when it’s open! In fact, the screen is longer! So far I haven’t had an issue with a visual line where it folds. I wanted to use it for days after it came but was worried about how I would get the data from my older iOS iPhone transferred onto the Android Flip6. I had some issues years ago with transferring from other phones. With the 256GB Flip6 it turned out that the stress and delay was all unnecessary!When I started the transfer it was SO easy!!! Setup explained and took me through every step clearly. There was even an option to select transferring from an iOS iPhone to the Android Flip6. The only glitch was that I needed a certain cable to connect the two phones if I didn’t want to do it wirelessly. The Flip6 even told me which cable to use and it waited without having to start over while I did a frantic search, during which I discovered that I actually had the one needed with lightening on one end and USB C on the other. For those who have older iPhones that use lightening cables just be sure you have one with a USB C connector on the other end if you don’t want to transfer your personal data wirelessly. Wirelessly was an option.Also, the Flip6 needs to be fully charged before first use and it comes with a USB C to USB C cable but doesn’t come with an adapter. My iMac desktop has a USB C port and that charged it fine. I didn’t know if my adapters like the one for my iPad Pro could be used and if they would be too powerful to safely charge the Flip6. Haha, silly me. Samsung has super charger adapters available compatible with the Galaxy Z Flip6 much more powerful than any I have on hand. I have since ordered a couple USB C super charger adapters compatible with this phone on Amazon for faster, more portable charging than what I currently have.My first experiment with the Flip6 was taking photos, and to my surprise when I told my husband  “Smile” it took his photo without my even pressing the touch activated camera button! There was a countdown in seconds before it took his photo on its own. The quality and detail of the photo was remarkable. Our living room lighting was dim but the photo was clear and detailed. I had a lot of fun after that saying “Smile” and taking more photos, including of myself.For the selfie photo experiment I was, as with my previous cell phones, not thrilled at how I looked. I saw a different face than the one in the bathroom mirror and wondered which was the real me since cameras don’t lie, or do they? My husband peeked over my shoulder and told me I didn’t really look like that and suggested I hold the phone further away. It helped a little but it wasn’t until I took a photo of myself in the mirror with the rear camera that he said that it looked like me. It seems to be a distance thing. One other way to take a selfie that is cool with this phone is in the folded position. In that position the Flip6 can be set on a surface and the rear double lens camera can be used. I can stand further back than my arm’s length, say “Smile” and it takes my picture. I take lots of pictures for portrait and nature paintings and this phone’s photo quality is overall quite an upgrade, especially the double lens.Another surprising new thing that happened during first use was that the phone repeated in a female voice what I loudly told my dogs when they were barking! I still don’t know what I did to activate that function, but it will be interesting and exciting to try all the new functions and AI capabilities.When I  transferred my current cell service including my phone number to the Flip6, it was again SO easy! As directed by the carrier, I downloaded their app from the Google Play app store and with the IMEI 1 number in Settings I didn’t even need a SIM card. There was no extra transfer fee to keep my phone number like there was in past transfers. It helped to write down the long IMEI 1 number so I didn’t have to go back and forth from Settings to the carrier app during the process since it is too long to remember. For some reason I was unable to copy and paste it. I don’t know why, maybe it was just the way I did it. The set up took a little while but was relatively fast. Shortly after completion I received a call and a text from a friend without a glitch on the new phone! For anyone slightly intimidated by setting up a new phone like I am it is much faster and easier now than it used to be and the instructions on this phone make it pretty stress free.Added Note: after transferring my existing phone number from my iOS iPhone to the Android Flip6 I received phone calls and text messages on the Flip6. However, I later discovered that I was only able to receive texts from Android phones and not iPhones. I spent a lot of time researching this issue and it can happen after an existing number on an iPhone is transferred to an Android. There is a recommended fix on the Apple site in Support. From the Apple site, “If you switched to a non-Apple phone and aren't getting SMS/MMS messages, you might need to deregister iMessage”. Following the prompts in Apple Support, my phone number was deregistered from iMessage online and it only took a few minutes (this was done AFTER the transfer to the new Android phone). I am now getting text messages on the Flip6 from my friends and family who use iPhones. I hope this saves time and helps those who may have the same issue. It worked for me!","August 6, 2024"
3679,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,F Roman,4,"I purchased this to replace my Samsung Ultra S22 and have been using it for a little over a week now. I did attempt to trade in for a flip 5 at one point, but that camera was... bad, so I ended up keeping my Ultra. There are obviously many differences between the two, the camera being just the first. I'll go into some including - Overall feel, Camera, Screen, Fingerprint sensor, Charging and Battery Life, and OtherOverall feelIt feels quality. It doesn't feel like a phone that might shatter or snap in half when I inevitably drop it down the steps, but I'll report back when that happens. The hinge is solid. It is not the hinge of the old days where you can flip the phone open at a snap of the wrist. You will need a second hand. The phone stays in positions from lie flat all the way down to the smallest of degrees without closing or changing the angle.CameraThe Ultra's camera is better by miles, but that is something you probably know going in. The flip's camera is now very serviceable, and Samsung has some sort of wizardry that helps that along cleaning up your somewhat blurry zoomed in pictures for you. It feels like I don't need to carry around a second item for photos, and since every day is not a vacation, I'm good with that. If you are a selfie person, you can leave the phone closed using the outside screen to take your selfies getting the full power of the main lenses unlike other devices where you get the lessor selfie cam lens, making this camera better in at least that use case.ScreenScreen, yeah, you can see and feel where it folds. In my opinion, it isn't terrible, though. It's the price of having a foldable phone, and with the screen on at a normal viewing angle, that fold line isn't present for me. The screen feels nice, even over the bump, though you can tell it is not the same super durable S22 Ultra glass. Leave the preinstalled screen protector on.The screen is nearly the same length as the S22 Ultra, but it is narrower. With the phone open, the narrowness can make the phone a little tricky to hang on to if you are trying to one hand the phone and touch buttons at the bottom of the screen. I can't quite put my finger on it, but it does feel like somewhat of a balancing act compared to the heartier S22. The width of the screen has, I think, also played havoc with one of my weather apps sometimes not showing some information, but otherwise hasn't bothered me.The screen feels big enough, and is also not an endless display, so I welcomed back some bezels. Having bezels back has actually been kind of nice as the endless had a tendency to pick up errant touches on the sides.FingerprintThe flip fingerprint sensor is on the power button, and works very well... almost too well. It picks up my fingers even when I'm not trying to unlock my phone. There is a setting that will fix this so that the sensor only works when cover or main screen is on, but I like only having to touch the button to wake up the phone, so this is my tradeoff.Charging and Battery LifeIt isn't slow, but it is not Super fast like the S22. It guesses about 1:15 to go from 50%-100% where as the S22 would go from 0-100% in less than an hour using the same cable and brick. I am rarely away from a charger anymore, so it's fine, but I can see it being inconvenient for those times where I want a quick shot of juice. It won't give that same bang for the 5 minutes.The battery seems to last about the same amount of time as the S22. Basically a full day depending on my uses. If I'm playing games throughout the day (which I won't get into other than to say I haven't noticed any performance difference between this and the S22, which is a good thing), the battery drains more quickly and might not make it a full day, but that is to be expected, and was the case with my S22, and basically every other phone I've had as well. If you use it like a phone with a camera, you should be fine from wake to sleep.OtherGoogle assistant. I'm not sure if this is Samsung's fault or not, but if you tell Google to do something with the phone closed, the outside screen will tell you to open the phone to complete the command. This is absurd, and one of the main reasons, even with all the other nitpicks, that I can't give this 5*. Maybe this gets fixed in a future update (probably not, though, I imagine we are going on 5 years of this). If I need to pull my phone out and open it up, I'm probably doing whatever task I needed done all by my self. Bixby does work from the outside screen, though, so this is the first time I've ever had it enabled (though it is super limited in comparison).","July 30, 2024"
3680,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,F Roman,5,"It took me a little while to get used to this phone from an iPhone but it has a ton more features and is more useful.  The stand up and translate feature is really cool and lets you share screens with someone sitting across from you.  The folding screen is durable and flexible more than I expected and it doesn't have the same exact feel as a fixed screen, but it allows the phone to be so much smaller.  Charging is fast and wireless and the phone is fast and wonderful.  The photos are beautiful and I really like it.  I wasn't sure, but I needed something smaller.  This one is a good one!","August 9, 2024"
3681,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,userNO12345,5,"This Galaxy Flip6 is the phone I've been needing. I like it not only because of all of its operational features, but also the fact that it folds. That helps me fit it in smaller places when I'm on the go. This phone has so many features that I'll never use all of them, but the ones I do use now, are excellent. I'm very satisfied with this phone!","August 4, 2024"
3682,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Amazon Customer,5,I just activated the phone so this is an early review. But the design a function is awesome.  It owns to a regular size when you use it but folds small for easy carrying.  I carry two phones so this is a big plus.  It is mostly intuitive to use.  I am in a rural area and was surprised with pretty good connectivity.,"August 2, 2024"
3683,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Spirit Whispers,2,"so initially I LOVED my phone. It was cute, trendy, light and small.  However when closed it would weirdly activate apps, videos would be on the screens, settings would change.  One day I woke up and my screen looked like an ink spill. It had a little of original screen but mostly black. It was inoperable. I called Samsung because it was still under warranty. I went to 2 recommended repair stores. They told be first, I would have warmed you against buying this phone. Secondly they said Samsung makes it impossible to get warranty.  ie, my phone had a scratch in the corner which happened when I first bought the phone and find a protective cover. It was going to cost 300 dollars to repair phone. Repairman said probably shouldn't repair because it wouldn't last. I've only ever used Samsung for 20yrs. Very loyal customer. I bought a 300 dollar Motorola. Basically I'm still paying ATT for the""free"" phone for trading in another. While a trendy look, phone will not last. Samsung says it broke from it remind and closing to much. I have no games on my phone and we truly use it very little. Disappointed and angry.","August 25, 2024"

Samsung has loss a customer for life over a know faulty screen issue. Several reviews say the samething. Please Loyal Samsung customer they do care about you. Please do not care about them. I know because under ever bad review it is a copy and paste of the same message to tell to do the samething except getting help. For you that having streen issue just connect to your PC.

I was looking forward to trying galaxy but I guess I’ll be sticking with my Apple. I wish I could have had a better experience.","August 7, 2024"
3687,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,David E Gilley,4,"Captain's Log: Day 2It's not really day 2, but I'm just going to have to number by entry because I'm not going to go counting days on the calendar.So. I've had this phone since 26 July. It's now 8 August, and I have still not switched my phone number over to this one from my old phone. I want to love it. SO MUCH. I do not love it. That boils down to two reasons: screen size and stylus.The screen is narrower than I want it to be, especially at the price. My old phone (and I do mean OLD) is maybe a couple of millimeters wider, but man do those count when you're trying to read tiny text. I'm using a Note 8, which for those counting is like 12 generations old at this point, and grandma is still kicking - and she's also WELL smaller than a great many of the more current models across a variety of brands. That means that you are very likely going to have a BIGGER size difference to contend with. If you need it to be smaller, this may be your phone. If you don't want to sacrifice screen size, this is most certainly NOT IT for you.I'm coming from a Note, and you will pry that pen from my cold, dead hands. For those who aren't familiar, I mean a pen that lives inside the phone and pops out when you push the end, not another device to keep up with separately. (Google the Note series if you need a visual here.) Yes, I see the logistical issues with the flip situation, and no, I don't care. If they can fold an entire touch screen they can fold a pencil.So my favorite thing about this phone so far is.... drumroll please... updated apps. My elderly phone is not getting updates anymore, so I'm therefore not on the newest version of a great many apps. I cannot tell a lie: NYT games is a big one. The interface is so much better on the newer app and that's 90% of what I use the new phone to do. Would this be true of pretty much any new phone? Yes. Take that as you will.The dip remains annoying but if I were otherwise a fan it would be no big deal. The touch interface is annoying me, but in all fairness that's probably because I'm switching back and forth and therefore the muscle memory is confused all the time.I'm playing with the camera, and the jury is still out in that regard. I like what I like, and what I like most of all is predictability. Anybody who takes a lot of photos or is a serious hobby will tell you the same thing, if they're self-aware enough to realize that this is a fundamental part of photography. If my camera doesn't act the same every single time, then every shot is to some extent a shot in the dark, and I'm not okay with that. The more things a camera does for you, the less predictable it is - generally speaking, I mean. If it always does the exact same things in the exact same ways, that's fine, but this thing is trying to be smart and that means it's like wrestling another living being that has its own Opinions and Goals (which may not align with my own) rather than using a tool over which I have complete control. All that said, though, the end results are GOOD when I'm not trying any funny stuff. Maybe once this being and I manage to learn each other's quirks, we'll be the best of friends. Maybe I'll hurl it off a bridge. Only time will tell. I know that doesn't help you make your decisions right this minute, but unless you're the sort who owns a DSLR and actually manually adjusts settings as a matter of course, I would suspect you'll be fine with this camera. It produces good output without having to fiddle with it.Until next time, y'all.Captain's Log: Day 1It's my plan to play around with the phone, use it, and come back with updates as I have more input. There's no way anybody can sit down and ""review"" a phone or computer or anything like that as far as I'm concerned. I mean, the techie sorts can do the techie things (not me, but my spouse is, so you'll get some of that eventually), but it's still only theoretical until you integrate a new device into your everyday life and usage patterns.Anyway. Day one (well 2 really since I got it yesterday). Barely out of the box. Comes with nothing but a charging cable. No brick. Anybody getting this phone has plenty of places to plug in and/or has a preference for bricks or multiports or whatever, so I'm fine with this. I mean I actually could use a freaking brick but only because I can't currently find any of the three dozen that are someplace in this house. We've got plenty of those Anker multiport situations, though. Oh - it comes with a quick start guide, but I've seen more instructions on the back of frozen french fries, so you'll need access to the Goog or whatever you use to answer your questions. I got my first smart phone many years ago and it came with a literal novel-sized book, so this would have to come with an encyclopedia set and 99% of it would be irrelevant to me anyway, so I'm also fine with this. There's a web site but we all know we're just going to google our questions and start pushing buttons to see what happens.This is narrower than I expected in the hand. I'm not mad about that. The screen interface is WILD. I mean the touch feel - it's different than the glass on my last phone. Jury is out on how I feel about it but preliminary indications are good. The lenses stick out a good bit, and that has me considering some of those little lens protectors.It charges up very quickly, though that will also be a function of your charging setup. I used my own cords and such. Mine are longer and nicer.It's been in use less than 24 hours and already there's a little dip in the screen where it folds. I already do not like this but I'm not sure there's any way around it if you're going to fold a literal screen in half, at least with currently available technology.There's a little guide that comes up automatically when you turn it on for the first time. Next update will address the setup process and probably the camera since I'll probably want to fiddle with that fairly immediately.","July 26, 2024"

I've yet to see it reach full LTE, only regular 4G, which seems to be a common issue with unlocked smartphones. It could possibly be with the S6 in general tho, as my girlfriend has a nonunlocked S6 with Sprint and has the same issue. Despite that it works fast enough with cellular service, and really snappy with good WiFi.  The screen look absolutely phenomenal and the black sapphire color has gotten me many compliments. Not a big fan of Samsung and their bloated apps that can't really be uninstalled. Also if you value battery life this isn't your phone. Although I'm never very far from a charger so it hasn't been a big issue yet, plus when it charges it charges FAST.

3797,SAMSUNG Galaxy S22,Samuel,4,"I got this S22 5G phone to replace my S20 5G that according to my new cell carrier, wasn't actually 5G (AT&T now, previous carrier Verizon). That was a huge disappointment as I loved my S20.So every carrier & store were practically giving these S22 phones away, and yes, I could've gotten a 'free' phone, but as my dad taught me, nothing in life is free. So I shelled out $700 instead and got one through Amazon. Ok, I actually shelled out $1,400 & got 2. Why? Because 'free' from my carrier meant upgrading to an unlimited plan which would cost me $100 more per month - indefinitely. No thank you. There's Wi-Fi almost everywhere.So, I actually did a lot of research before buying this. This S22 had good reviews as well as some mixed reviews which concerned me. My S20 was actually awesome - still is - I can't use it for calls, but I still use it for internet access when I'm home and my S22 is charging. That said, it's hard for me not to compare this S22 to my S20.For me, battery life is a big deal. I've noticed the battery in the S20 is good, but it's not amazing. Still, it'll last you most of the day. I have to keep a charging cable at my office just in case. Visually, it's a good phone. It's not as good as the S20 which even though it's an older model, has more pixels which makes everything look better. The S22 camera is OK, but again, the S20 is superior and that annoys me as my phone IS my camera and my upgraded phone SHOULD be better. Lastly - and this one is important - the speaker phone is not good at all. So there it is. If you just need a phone for calls, texts, & internet then this S22 is fine. If you take lots of pics & opt for speaker over Bluetooth then skip this one.I've compared my older Samsung phone to this one in each aspect so that if you have an older (but not ancient) phone, you'll think twice before upgrading. Plus, don't fall for the unlimited scam the carriers are pushing - you'll be better off buying your phone (unless you alreadyhave an unlimited plan - then upgrade for free). The new phones are just not as good as they should be. Gone are the days where you can buy a replacement battery, so don't leave your phone charging overnight anymore!Hope this review helps you make a decision.","July 14, 2022"

I had an S21 that I sent in for a minor Bluetooth issue with my Cochlear sound processer and they sent it back to me ""bricked"".  I sent it in again and they couldn't fix or replace it.  They gave me a refund that was $300 less than the cost of the replacement.  It was cheaper to buy an S22 still at a higher price and it is actually not as good as the S21, the battery won't last 15 hours.  The only reason I bought the Samsung was because it was the only android phone supported by Cochlear and since it is an implant I can't very well switch to a different hearing aid.  BTW it took months to resolve this issue.11/12/2022 update.  The battery issue is even worse than I thought.  I have turned off all the ""features"" recommended to save battery usage and yesterday I got a low battery warning after 10 hours of just having the phone on, no calls, no media streaming, just some texts and some web use over my house WiFi.  No matter how good the camera is, and the screen and the performance ( all great btw) it is all for nothing if the phone has to be tethered to a charger.","August 13, 2022"

3803,SAMSUNG Galaxy S22,DeusExKing,3,"I have had the Samsung Galaxy S5, S7 & S9 phones, and have loved them, so I knew I wanted to purchase another Galaxy class phone. I wanted the S21 but could NOT FIND a new (not refurbished) S21 anywhere. I CANNOT AFFORD even the base model S23, so that left me with the S22. I really like the phone and I Absolutely love that I could finally get one in my favorite emerald green. I am happy with my new S22 for the most part, but I am extremely disappointed and frankly, quiet angry at Samsung for their poorly thought out and greedy decisions to remove the Mico SD card slot option from the S21s, s22s, and S23 phones. The added memory storage was one of the former key features that I absolutely loved about the Samsung phones. As a transplant candidate, I HAVE TO STORE A LOT OF MEDICAL INFORMATION on my phone. By removing the Mico SD card option, they have SEVERELY CUT THE AMOUNT of information I can keep. Instead of putting their customers storage needs 1st, like any great company should, Samsung has become exceedingly greedy, and has denied that option to their customers. They decided Instead to force their customers to pay higher prices on higher gigabyte phones. Prices that people who live off of merger, low, or SSDI ONLY (like me), incomes, CAN'T AFFORD. This corporate greed & lack of concern for their customers needs has been the most hurtful part of having to replace my phone. I DID NOT have the funds to purchase a new phone but as a double lung transplant candidate, I HAD TO HAVE A PHONE. My life literally depends on it.. I need a MINIMUM OF 512GB (256 phone + 256 memory card). But I HAD TO SETTLE for only HALF that because I couldn't afford the 512gb S22 phone. Don't get me wrong, the Galaxy phones themselves are still excellent in their performance, speed, connectivity and function. They are easy to use, extremely well made and frankly still the only brand I prefer to own. But the removal of the added SD card slot, is a major slap in the face. I hope Samsung realizes this stupid blunder and redeems themselves by continuing to include it in ALL of their Galaxy S phones from here on out. If and when the S24 comes out, I pray it'll be included going forward.","April 16, 2023"
3804,SAMSUNG Galaxy S22,Samuel,3,"As a diehard Samsung fan, i really wanted to love this phone. The spec sheets speaks to cost cutting measure to try to release a device while also upgrading some minor components from last years release.For the pros-Great form factor. Very easy to yield in one hand and much more comfortable to hold compared to an iPhone 13.-Nice vivid screen with variable refresh. Some ppl will not notice much a difference in day day use. The phone will feel faster and smoother when navigating through menus or webpages. Video content tends to run at 60 fps so you won't notice much for a difference in media consumption.-Lightweight. The combination of aluminum and glass made this device much easier to yield.-Great UI and customization. Samsung leads the way with being to change everything from fonts, icons, tile placements, themes. Very robust options and some are available for free via thier Samsung storeCons- Terrible battery. Most reddit posts and reviewers will tell you to disable or throttle services to get it to last all day. But why pay for features that you can readily get at a fraction pf the price or cheaper (Like a pixel 5a or a Zenphone 9).- Thermal throttling issues. May not he a big issue for you but extensive gaming will render the phone hot to the touch. It appears the passive cooling on the device has either been taken away or not implemented in a way to help mitigate heat away from the hands-Unoptimized OS/Hardware. Something about this release feels rushed. I experienced terrible standby time (phone died unused in my pocket at a wedding venue in 8 hours). Apps would generally freeze or force close.At its msrp, this phone is a hard pass. At 700, there are much better devices with better performance both in battery and software. If youre looking at this price range, consider a Pixel 5a (not the 6 as Tensor is still buggy), Zenphone 9, or even an Apple 13/ 13Mini","August 19, 2022"

Maybe I got a faulty unit or it's actually that bad, but for a week straight I wasn't able to get over 3 hours of screen on time. I wouldn't say I'm a power user or anything and mostly use my phone for social media. But my 4 year old OnePlus 5T lasts longer than this phone. I turned off 120hz display and 5g thinking it might improve the battery but that didn't help either. This could be a user error but I was never able to get myself through the day on a single battery charge.All that said the standby battery is pretty good. If I don't use the phone for hours the battery doesn't drain at all but right as I pick it up I just see the percentage going down.I would 100% recommend this phone for anyone who's looking for a small phone and they don't care about how long their phone lasts and always have chargers near by.

I woke up one morning, unplugged the phone from charging (yes it was fully charged), was swiping away a couple notifications, went to click on my weather app, and the phone made a pop sound and shut off. I tried everything to power it back on, pressed and held all different combination of buttons, I even let it charge for a few hours again, and nothing. It just bricked itself.

The Routines feature is really the only good thing about it. Also there doesn't seem to be a way to disable automatic system updates, so it will just shut down and update with no warning.

3861,Samsung Galaxy S10,TPA,5,"My Galaxy S9 developed a screen glitch (hardware related) so I looked for a replacement, otherwise I would still be using it. The S10+ was the last Samsung flagship to have both ear phone jack and memory expansion slot. I am not as concerned as some about having the latest software support; I can always root and upgrade manually if I so choose. I opted for NEW old stock and I suggest buying from DAC Enterprises as she currently has the best deals by far on these. The phone came unlocked with Android 12, One UI 4.1 and with Android security updates to mid 2022. AFAIK, there are security updates available online for this phone to mid 2023. The S10+ from DAC Enterprises came in a sealed OEM box with OEM charging block and cable, SIM eject tool and some paperwork. No buds. It also comes with a screen protector front and back installed from the Samsung factory. I also have a SuperShieldz glass protector, but I am hesitant to apply it because of the ultrasonic fingerprint sensor.The S10+ is much the same as the S10, but larger with bigger battery and a depth sensor for the front camera for bokeh effects. The S10+ is an evolutionally upgrade over the S9/S9+, however there are some things I prefer in the S9. For starters, the fingerprint sensor. Using the capacitive FP sensor on the S9 was so much easier and quicker than on my old S5 before it. I always use a case and with the case, it's incredibly quick and easy to reach the sensor with my index finger. If you don't use a case then your expreience will not be nearly as good with the S9. For the S10, Samsung ""upgraded"" the tech to an ultrasonic FP sensor. For people who don't use cases, this change might have worked out reasonably well. But for me, now I have to locate the FP sensor on the open glass without a guide. (as the case cutout had been before). Yes, if I tap the screen it will light up the FP area, but this is an extra step not required on the older models. Next, I find that I need to press harder on the sensor (compared to the S9) to get a reliable reading. I am still getting used to it. YMMV, but for how I use my phones the S10/S10+ is a minor downgrade in terms of FP sensor convenience. OTOH, some say the new tech may be harder to spoof and thus be more secure.The other minor change I don't like is the power button has been moved up much higher (why Samsung?) and is now too high. Also, moving up to the plus size has exacerbated this issue for me. In addition, the buttons have been made smaller. I ask again why? Now they are a little harder to locate/use quickly. This may not mean much to some, but for people who are power users (like me, fast and efficient) or to the opposite extreme, people with sight disabilities, they will likely be slowed down with the smaller harder to locate buttons. It's more or less minor, but worth noting.Most of the changes though have been true upgrades and these phones are still (in 2024) IMHO world class with high end screens, cameras and audio reproduction capabilities. Android 12 is only 2 years old, and with 8 Gb RAM, 128 GB storage, and expansion available, this phone should keep almost everyone going for quite some time. If you can get it for the right price, 2 thumbs up.","June 26, 2024"

3869,Samsung Galaxy S10,tapout,3,"Ok comenzemos, compre el telefono s10 plus prisma green, 8 gb y 128 de almacenamiento versión internacional el  dia 2 de Octubre y lo devolvi el dia 5 de Octubre, la razon principal de la devolucion fue que al hacer el umboxin me encuentro con un cargador europeo si señor, y entonces!!! Ah para poder cargarlo debia comprar un adaptador??  porque debo yo incurrir en gastos adicionales si estoy comprando un elefono de casi 800$ el vendedor no coloca en ninguna parte de su descripcion que no viene con un cargador apto para los estados unidos. Otra cosa el telefono calienta de sobremanera al jugar, pero realmente calienta, no es que esta tibio no. Es caliente!! esto me llamo la atención mucho pero no pude hacerle otras pruebas ya que para mi lo primordial fue el cargador y revisen tambien no entendi porque la caja del telefono viene envuelta en un plastico sellado, los telefonos de alta gama y los que no, no traen esa envoltura plastica solo un sello transparente que hay que cortar para abrir la caja, este trajo aparte de esa envoltura plastica una etiqueta de color negro con unas especificaciones y recorde un video que vi de la comparativa de un telefono falso y uno verdadero y recorde esa etiqueta que la traia la caja del telefono falso, asi que si no le importa el asunto del cargador al comprarlo revisen bien esto que estoy diciendo aca, revisen muy bien los materiales del telefono que sea cristal la parte tarsera???, otro punto corri antutu en el teléfono y algo me llamo la atención en las especificaciones del teléfono arrojadas por antutu me decia que solo habian 2 camaras en la parte trasera?? esto me llamo la atencion y corri antutu en un galaxy a70 y alli si me dijo que habian 3 camaras, por todos estos detallitos y por la razon del cargador lo devolvi pero como dije antes no lo tube lo suficiente para poder garantizar que fuese falso o no, asi que si lo compran revisenlo por favor a fondo antes de que se les pase los 30 dias que les da amazon porque el teléfono no tiene garantia en los estados unidos y eso si lo especifica la descripción.Ok let's start, I bought the s10 plus prisma green, 8 gb and 128 international storage phone on October 2 and returned it on October 5, the main reason for the return was that when doing the umboxin I find a charger  European yes sir, and then !!!  Ah to be able to charge it, should I buy an adapter?  Because I must incur additional expenses if I am buying a telephone of almost $ 800 the seller does not place anywhere in his description that does not come with a charger suitable for the United States.  Another thing the phone heats up when playing, but it really heats, it's not that it's not warm.  It is hot!!  This caught my attention a lot but I could not do other tests since for me the main thing was the charger and check also I did not understand why the phone case is wrapped in a sealed plastic, high-end phones and those that do not, do not bring  that plastic wrap just a transparent seal that has to be cut to open the box, this brought apart from that plastic wrap a black label with specifications and I remembered a video I saw of the comparison of a fake phone and a real one and remember that  label that the fake phone box brought, so if you do not mind the issue of the charger when you buy it, check well what I am saying here, check very well the materials of the phone that is the late part glass ???, another point ran  Antutu on the phone and something caught my attention in the specifications of the phone thrown by Antutu told me that there were only 2 cameras in the back?  This caught my attention and I ran ahead in a galaxy a70 and there if he told me that there were 3 cameras, for all these details and for the reason of the charger I returned it but as I said before I did not tube it enough to guarantee that it was false or  No, so if you buy it, please check it thoroughly before it passes the 30 days that Amazon gives you because the phone has no guarantee in the United States and that if the description specifies it.","October 7, 2019"

3884,Samsung Galaxy S10,James,5,"Upgraded from the Note8 to this phone, the S10+, and I really enjoy using it. Transition was seamless, and the experience of usage is great and what you would expect of a flagship. The camera quality, and capabilities, are great. I actually enjoy using this phone more than my usage of my Note8. Definitely recommend the upgrade if you are on an 8th generation or earlier.Box came with serial number stickers, charging block (European connection), USB-C cable, USB-C to USB-A adapter, AKG headphones, a clear case, and paperwork. I did not put on the case on or use it at all, but I would say that it would only be good for small bumps and scratches, definitely not drops.I have purchased two cases, the Spigen Rugged Armor (thin protective case) and an Encased belt clip designed for that case (which is a nice combination). The second case I purchased is the Otterbox Defender, which I haven't received or used yet, but I'm looking forward to using it based on the reviews of others on YouTube.Incase you are wondering, it is the real thing, came to me brand new in the plastic wrap, with the Samsung manufacturer's seal unbroken.","April 20, 2019"
3885,Samsung Galaxy S10,Adwoa,3,"Good phone.  I've had this galaxy s10+ before.  Nothing was wrong with the phone. Seemed new in package with plastic over the screen and case.  Only thing is the charging cord was not factory which is not a big deal but there is not charger plug to put in the wall.  You can't get a replacement charger without ordering a complete phone replacement which will be another 2-3 days.  Not really worth the wait.  So 3 stars for the policies.  If you dont care about the charger, the phone is just fine.","May 22, 2023"
3886,Samsung Galaxy S10,C W Edwards,1,"Please do not attempt to purchase a similar phone from this Amazon seller (Stalion ReQuip). This phone was ""supposedly unlocked"". I was able to install my SIM and could make phone calls. But it's branded to ATT, it cannot be updated and locks up on me EVERY SINGLE DAY!!! (this is a new phone BTW) The seller wanted me to basically get the phone into dev mode and do a bunch of reprogramming which I did not feel I should have. At the end the return window closed and being without a cell phone nowadays is real difficult. Especially without a landline. And I've worked in Telecommunications for 20 years. STAY AWAY from Stalion ReQuip's phones.","July 11, 2024"
3887,Samsung Galaxy S10,John B,5,"I can not stress to someone who is thinking about purchasing this phone, how much I absolutely love mine! This is hands down, the best phone I've ever had. This is a little strange of Samsung because they are dabbling with technology in this phone that really hasn't been used ever so there are some kinks. For instance, the fingerprint reader is not the best in the world, they honestly would have been better off with an optical in-screen scanner like the ones on the oneplus 6T in my opinion. The facial recognition isnt the greatest but it's very decent. I understand they had to sacrifice hefty more accurate components for more screen real estate and that is honestly a sacrifice I'm willing to make. This phone is the fastest peace of technology I've ever seen, its ridiculous. Snap 855 and 8gb of ram, you cant beat it! I enjoy the attempts at pursuing new tech and this phone to me, is an embodiment of that. I hope the tech gets better, but I won't see it for another 5 years at this price!","May 12, 2019"

I went to add it to my account and when I put in the IMEI #, AT&T says it is not compatible with this phone. It is the exact same phone as my old one and I am not sure why it is not compatible. Please change the description from saying it is ready for AT&T because it is not.","December 5, 2023"
3896,Samsung Galaxy S10,Oldmax,3,"First and foremost I love the screen, big beautiful and crisp. It makes consuming media such a pleasurable experience! The size of the phone is a bit big otherwise lol, but you can make it work using the one handed operations quite easily..Battery life is definitely another win, I get through a full day consistently with 50-40 percent left before I go to bed around 11,with moderate usage (YouTube and Netflix watching, social media etc.)So of course the camera. Toting 5 lenses you'd think it would be amazing, but it's a big let down, at least to me. The options are many but the image quality is subpar; don't know what's going on with the image processing, but my nexus 6p of 3 + years ago still takes much better pictures. They may seem good on the surface but as soon as u zoom in, even a little bit, on a picture you took, it looks bad.It mars an otherwise perfect phone.","March 29, 2019"

There are a lot of reviews of this phone, for some people is the perfect jewel and for other a piece of garbage, so I guess that those opinions are based on the expectations with the phone. I know from the beginning what I was buying and what to expect and I'm not dissapointed. I'm happy with my new phone. The phone was delivered on time in a good shape and complete with all accesories on a sealed box, Great Vendor.  I bought two of this phones, one black and one white, and both were perfect.

My service provider is T-mobile so I ordered this phone to use on T-mobile. It is a brand new phone but it's completely useless for me because it's locked on ATT network. When the phone is turned on it shows ATT logo and plays ATT welcome sound. When I insert my T-Mobile SIM card the carrier is not found and message says that the SIM is locked and askes for unlock code. I tried to contact Amazon or the company that sells these phones (Samsung Store) but nobody answered. I called ATT and they say I need an account with them in order to unlock the phone.","March 4, 2024"

The screen started flickering to the extent that I had a hard time using any of the apps. This progressed over 2 days, while I was on a road trip from Texas to California, to where I couldn't log in to my phone. I contacted the seller and was told it was already out of warranty. I tried all the youtube fixes, resetting the phone, and nothing has worked. If you purchase one of these phones, buy the extended warranty Amazon offers. You might need it.

Well I was wrong I popped my sim in and the phone said the device was locked after spending the better part of the day on the phone and exchanging emails with Samsung and art customer support I came to find out that the phone is either stolen or not paid off so att refuses to unlock it for service with other carriers.

I believed being on T-mobile that the service was gonna be great but its not. I have to  shout or the the other person has to speak louder for me to hear. the volume is fine. Maybe ihave a wrong case which i got from the same seller. I took the phone to a T-mobile store in order to set it , i was shocked that it could not pick the  4GLTE signal. i liked this phone because of dual sim among other features.

The phone was unlocked but a **NETWORK UNLOCK CODE** kept popping up when sim card was insterted. (Thats the photo in this review.) So I swore the phone wasnt unlocked. Reached out to the seller and my carrier which was walmart family mobile. I was told by my carrier i needed a new sim card. So i ordered it and when it finally arrived,  boom same error. My carrier reset the sim many times and still no luck. When i had messaged the seller they gave me a code that wasnt right and when i reached out again, still another wrong code. What the phone fails to warn you is that only after a few attempts it will lock you out completely. It will then say **MASTER KEY CODE** needed. I googled what that was and it seemed like a hopeless code to obtain. The startup on the phone says AT & T. So i took it to their store and they had said that yes the phone was unlocked!! But the network was locked to walmart family mobilewhich was my carrier . So come to find out the code i needed, the first code, the network unlock code, I needed from my carrier!  They absolutely missed it and after days of this mess and ongoing phone calls, finally the walmart family mobile agent on that day in the At&T store had told me the codes i needed from day one. Idk how they just skipped the option and blamed my sim card. The codes arent a secret and im still unsure why they didnt recommend theirs to fix it. I guess they just assumed it wasnt their codes needed. But it was!!! Unbelievable right!! So then were now stuck on master key code and no one, my carrier, nor AT&T, nor samsung can help with that. Due to the sellers wrong codes, me googling the wrong codes, and most of all my carriers support line not mentioning their codes, I was locked out and was gonna return the phone. However AT&T did show me other sim cards put into the phone by other carriers were working. It was still unlocked but just couldnt now be used on family mobile and possibly all tracphone carriers due to the master key code lock. So with that said I swapped to AT&T prepaid and got their sim card and it all worked great! It was recommended to get the sim card from the AT&T store directly because sometimes those sim kits at walmart dont always work correctly and are nonrefundable. So if this issue happens to you just be sure to ask your carrier for those network codes!! The seller now knows what to suggest if this happens to another and I'm telling you that the carrier has the codes and all will be fine. Also the seller offered me a replacement phone  and partial refund for this issue. I declined a replacement only because I couldnt send this phone back and await a new one. I was already without a phone long enough dealing with this for days. So the seller at least still gave me a partial refund and that was okay with me. So the customer service is well and fair from them!!! Also even AT&T said the phone itself was in such great shape! So far so good on the phone itself, everything is working as it should.","July 6, 2023"
3961,Samsung Galaxy S20,Honest_Critic,5,"After nearly four years with my Samsung A10e, I decided it was time for an upgrade. My criteria were specific: I wanted a more recent, used Samsung phone that was unlocked, had ample storage, and most importantly, featured a microSD slot for my extensive music library. The Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G in Cloud Red ticked all these boxes and more.Transitioning from the A10e, the performance leap to the S20 FE was immediately noticeable. Everything from navigating the UI to streaming content on YouTube and multitasking feels incredibly responsive. This phone has transformed my user experience, offering a significant improvement in speed and efficiency.Despite being a renewed device, the quality of the S20 FE pleasantly surprised me. It arrived with minor marks on the sides, but these were hardly a concern given the excellent condition of the screen and the overall functionality of the phone. I've always been particular about battery health, so I appreciated the ""Protect Battery"" feature, which I also used on my A10e. The battery performance has been exceptional, supporting my heavy music streaming habits without a hitch.The larger display is a game-changer. The vibrant colors and increased screen real estate enhance everything from watching videos to browsing the web. I've disabled certain features to extend battery life, but this hasn't detracted from my overall experience with the phone.One of the reasons I opted for an unlocked phone was the flexibility it offers. While I primarily use the S20 FE for media consumption, it's reassuring to know it can serve as a reliable backup for calls and texts if needed. The phone's build quality and care in its refurbishment are evident, making it a solid investment for anyone in the market for a high-quality, used smartphone.In summary, the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G has exceeded my expectations. It offers a perfect blend of performance, quality, and value, making it an excellent choice for Samsung enthusiasts and anyone looking for a premium smartphone experience without the flagship price tag.","February 17, 2024"
3962,Samsung Galaxy S20,Briana Arenz,4,"The phone is working great so far. Battery life is okay. I was able to activate to my provider with no issues and transfer everything from my old S9 to this one. I like the screen size and phone itself. However, I ordered the phone in excellent condition but the back has a lot of dings, scratches, and scuffs. Sure, a phone cover will hide them, but by ordering as excellent, I expected the back to be free of this many imperfections. The screen and camera is fine, though.","August 31, 2024"
3963,Samsung Galaxy S20,Briana Arenz,5,"I got purchased one in ""excellent"" condition. I was nervous, as I had never bought a used phone before and did not know what to expect. Physical inspection was fine. It turned on fine. In the box were the usual accessories, charging cord and wall adapter. I removed all the useless apps that phones come with, and stopped all the useless processes. Even so, the first few weeks were rough, as the battery would drain every day. At night, with 0 use, it would drain 20-30% in 8 hours. But then it seemed to equal itself out, and battery is great. It only drains by 1% at night now. I'm not sure what was going on with that. I read the specs before I received it, and it works as expected for me. No usability issues at all. Android Auto works perfectly with this, as opposed to continually disconnecting with my old phone. This charges very fast as well.","August 1, 2024"
3964,Samsung Galaxy S20,Auricom,3,"When you buy something that has been renewed or refurbished, you do so with the understanding that the product was returned due to defects, but is being resold at a cheaper cost because those defects were corrected. Right?That was my rational when I bought this phone in November of 2023, replacing a cheap $70 dollar junk phone offered to me at a discount by my cellular provider. I mean, my friend bought a renewed phone off Amazon and has been very satisfied with it. Mine began giving me issues roughly a month into ownership.One of the ""handy"" little security features with this phone is a moisture/debris detector located in or around the charging port. After about a month of owning and using the phone, I was unable to actively charge my phone. The device would give me a warning saying to unplug the device immediately to prevent damage being done to the circuitry. It will not charge the battery so long as the port remains in a ""compromised"" state. You cannot turn off the sensor in the settings. I've tried clearing the port of this supposed dust and debris to no effect. I've taken it to rooms where we have dehumidifiers, and it still gives me this warning when i try to charge.The only option left to me was to buy a wireless charging pad, which can cost you up to $100 bucks. I was lucky to have a friend who had one to spare. It's the only way I can recharge the phone without taking it to a repair shop to test/replace the charging port. Most places I've seen online list replacing the port costs $99 dollars for part and labor, but there's no guarantee my local repair shops will abide by that.I've bought other products from Amazon's ""Renew Store"" that have been listed as renewed and have not given me issues, such as my bluetooth headset. But for whatever reason, this phone's issues slipped through their quality control. For that, I'm rather disappointed. I'm also very disappointed that Samsung would build ransomware into their phone and list it as a security feature.More importantly, I am disappointed in myself for simply accepting the phone as it is and using the wireless charger my friend gave me rather than send the phone back and demand a phone that was actually fixed. I will likely end up paying the extra $100+ bucks to have someone else repair the charging port.Knowing what I do now, would I buy with Amazon Renew Store again? Maybe. Between me and my friend, we've bought 3 products, with 2/3 being a worth while purchase. Those aren't terrible odds, and honestly, I could have probably fixed the situation myself if had brought it up to the seller. I may not have bought the same phone though, if I had to do it over. Samsung knew what it was doing when it added this feature to the phone, especially given they sell you the work-around for an extra $100-200 bucks. Slimey wretches.","March 5, 2024"

3966,Samsung Galaxy S20,C Reyloc,5,"I'd say that this Samsung S20 FE 5G has got to be one of the best smartphones that takes excellent photos that I have ever had in my life.....so far! It has wireless charging on it (something I did not know about), excellent camera set up that takes pretty good photos for the most part, excellent videos, has 128 GB of internal storage....however...there is NO slot for a microSD card for additional storage (a minor drawback]. Fingerprint reader is directly on the screen and it was hard to get used to that at first, but did not take long to get used to it and it works very good. Games seems to play rather well on this smartphone, tho I probably would not do very intensive gaming on this phone. Basic games works mighty well on this smartphone though. Really I think the only issues I have with this smartphone from Samsung are 2 things.....lack of extra storage and the camera will turn itself off if you go wide-angle when taking photos or videos. It seems to be a common issue/problem with Samsung S20 FE 5G smartphones. There are videos on You Tube on this issue and how to fix it....which is overall an easy fix. That issue does not happen until you hit a certain Samsung or Android update on this phone. Overall, a great smartphone and it's water resistant also....not sure about it being waterproof....so don't put it in water at all. I would rate this Samsung smartphone a pretty decent 5 of 5....despite those 2 minor issues with the Camera turning off frequently and the lack of extra storage space.","December 22, 2023"

It's an upgrade for me from the s8 and it's faster, slightly larger and better camera/video quality.I do have one problem, though. It must've been originally designed for verizon because I get a push notification every 10 minutes saying my sim card is not a verizon sim card. I know this is a common problem because I've seen it in other comments but I haven't been able to figure out a workaround that actually works. Maybe the seller could post instructions on their description somewhere?","August 10, 2024"

3969,Samsung Galaxy S20,StormTrackerJay2,4,"This was my first experience buying a used phone. I was very hesitant, but am mostly pleased overall.The included cable (no brick included) does NOT charge my phone. They included a very cheap-o charging cable & this phone is PICKY! Actually I found ALL Samsung phones that we have/ have tried are... they only accept a USB C cable with a thicker wall to the plug in part. Any of the cheapo cables will NOT work.On the plus side, I was able to determine that this phone came with 92% battery life by using the ACU battery app...which was a huge concern for me buying a used phone. That was a happy relief!The camera is pretty nice! I tried & returned a brand new A23 before buying this used phone, and that camera was absolutely horrible.. worse than my very first LG cell phone that I got 8 years ago... yes, WORSE than that!After seeing what a piece of junk the A23 was & after talking to someone at the T-Mobile store, they told me that the A series phones are very bottom of the barrel and poor quality. I came to the realization that in order to get a phone that was decent, I was going to have to buy a used phone. I opted for the S20 FE instead of the S21, because the s20 is able to be expanded with a microSD card & the S21 can't be.I am not about to put all my stuff on some cloud or pay for extra storage. I opted out of an iPhone for that very reason. If Samsung doesn't allow for storage cards to expand their phones'  memories in the future, I will buy a different brand that does. After reading several reviews, I know there are others who feel the same way. I sure hope Samsung listens & doesn't go the disappointing route Apple does with their phones & lack of storage expansion.Overall, I'm happy with my used phone & the seller, minus the fact that they didn't even check to see if the charging cable worked that they sent with the phone. It did not & I had to buy new ones just for this phone.I WOULD purchase the phone again, although I'm not super fond of such a finicky phone in regards to the charging cable. I know it's a Samsung thing because my hubby's old S8 is the same as was the A23 I tried & returned. I don't like feeling like I have to carry a spare charging cable with me everywhere in the event that my main charging cable doesn't work with my phone for some reason. I never had that issue with my other brand USB C charged phones. Samsung phones seem to only work with cables that have a thicker wall to the C part of the charging cable. If LG was still making phones, I would have purchased one of those instead. We've tried TCL & Motorola...& Apple is a hard pass, so that left me with Samsung.","July 4, 2023"

3976,Samsung Galaxy S20,Paula Neilands,4,"I received this S20 FE Renewed from Stalion Requip, Shipped from Amazon. Arrived with Android 13 installed. Phone was well packed and came in a plain box with a nice 5Volt 2Amp (9Volt 1.87Amp) charger, USB C charging cable, and SIM Tray removal tool. The box was labeled NEW. It is NEW, Pristine, Looks and Performs Flawlessly with one major exception. The S20 FE is a 'dumbed down' (cheaper) version of the S20 series. My Cell service is Tracfone through Verizon. I later found out the S20 FE does not support the mmWave bands needed for the fastest 5G Verizon service, nor does it reliably connect to Verizon in my weak signal home location. As a result I couldn’t get connected unless I walked outside my house into my driveway. Other Samsung and Apple phones connect to my Tracfone/Verizon service just fine inside my home. I even tried putting my SIM card in each of those other phones and they all connected just fine. Their SIM cards in the S20 FE had the same bad result. Someone living in a strong signal area would not notice unless they travel into a weak signal area. This seems to be a problem with the design of the S20 FE and not the fault of the Renewer or Amazon. I wasn't willing to wait and try a replacement S20 FE 5G, so unfortunately I had to send the S20 FE 5G back. I ended up ordering the S20+ from Stalion Requip and Shipped by Amazon, The S20+ supports most of the LTE bands and 5G bands (including mmWave bands) used by Verizon in my weak signal area. The S20+ connects properly to Tracfone/Verizon anywhere inside my home. This is important especially if you live or travel in a weak signal area with Verizon or other CDMA carrier. I don’t know about GSM carriers.I can’t say enough good about Stalion Requip. All Renewers are not created equal. Stalion Requip includes a printout of all the internal specs and test results. Purchase your phone from Stalion Requip and you won’t be disappointed with their work.","January 7, 2024"

The battery in my last Samsung lasted much longer.  I understand this is a refurbished phone so I guess that's to be expected.

3988,Samsung Galaxy S20,Sherlanda,5,"I started getting notices from Sprint/TMobile that I needed to upgrade my phone to a 5G compatible phone by the end of the year. I went to the store and even though I had not upgraded my phone in 4 years there was no offers/discounts ( days of subsidizing phones really are dead but dang ). There was absolutely zero offers. Even the basic Samsung A32 was no longer offered as a free phone.I am not cheap but I am simply not willing to pay $800+ for a phone that will be outclassed in a few months.Started looking on Amazon for refurbished phone and the seller Last Of The Loot had the S20 FE for $400. Having read reviews from other buyers I knew was still rolling the die with complaints about scuff marks ( Not from that seller in particular but from refurb phone in general. I can accept cosmetic stuff since a refurb just means it functions to spec and blemishes to the case are something you can expect ), the phone being reported as stolen, the previous owner still owned money so it could not be unlocked, cracked screens, etc.I got this phone and when I opened the box it looked like it had never been used. Screen and case were pristine. It came with the owner's manual and a 15W charger. I know some people complain about that but this phone charges pretty fast and has pretty good power management so unless you are watching 4K videos all day or treating it as a portable game console the charge rate is really good IMHO. I don't have a wireless charger but am looking into it now.Phone is quite responsive in all aspects and the screen is simply gorgeous to watch videos on. Sound on the two speakers ( one at the top facing towards you and another at the bottom facing down ) is simply phenomenal. I had an HTC One when back in the day and I thought that sounded good. The difference in sound quality, volume and range of frequencies you can hear in the highs, mids and lows is like comparing $20 radio to surround sound.I have not delved into all the options in detail but I love the face unlock and fingerprint unlock options to secure your phone. Can't say too much about the camera yet since I have never been much of a picture taker but what I have seen so far it will definitely satisfy the average joe.Have used this phone as my daily driver for about 2 months now and have no had any issues whatsoever. I know that if you read some reviews and compare it to the S21 to upcoming S22 or S21 FE it will be another huge jump in performance and features but this looks like it will keep me chugging along for the next several years. If you want a newer phone but are on a budget or like me, you just find $1000+ for a phone to be ludicrous, this is good combination of price and performance.","December 29, 2021"

My cheap charger from Walmart works much better. Maybe they should invest in the $5 charger I bought @ Walmart.  There was also no instruction booklet with the phone,so I had to look up a couple of things before using it.  The screen protector kinda sucks, too.

I did a lot of research and every offer brought me back here to Amazon for the best value on an unlocked phone. I was very concerned though. Not exactly great reviews on Amazon reconditioned phones. To my surprise, the phone I received was in excellent condition. Not one issue to complain about. I've done my share of selling electronics on the the net and I put the extra effort into making sure my customers were very satisfied. It really boils down to the seller on Amazon. FlipCells was my seller and I would highly recommend them for a reconditioned phone. Great phone, great service, great price. I couldn't be more happy with my phone from FlipCells.","June 13, 2024"
4011,Samsung Galaxy S20,Honest_Critic,4,"I have now been using this phone for 11 days. Here's what you should know, out of the box the phone was pristine. I looked long and hard to find a blemish or defect, there was none. This looked like a brand new phone. Day one of using the phone I was highly unimpressed by it's battery life. The battery did not hold a charge for even half a day. I didn't believe Samsung would sell a phone with that bad of a battery OR this phone was defective. I did some research online and it seems this is the number one complaint about this phone. This is my 1st phone that has an ADAPTIVE BATTERY. I followed some advice online. Let the phone download all the updates etc..the 1st day or 2 this sucks up major battery power. Day 2 and 3 i kept my eye on the battery usage in the system settings. Until day 3 it said it was still learning my usage, once that went away the phone battery worked so much better! I mean don't get me wrong, I got rid of some apps I don't use, changed some settings to save battery life etc. My battery lasts the whole day now with regular use. The phone automatically puts apps to sleep when not in use so that def saves some battery power. All in all I say buy the phone. If you don't like it you have 60 days to return it. I do not buy expensive top of the line phones, I need a cost effective option for reg text, calls, music, browsing and this one hits the mark. I use the speakerphone for work calls and they are crisp and clear. The camera is much better than my A20. As of day 12 I give my new phone a score of 8 out of 10.","March 26, 2023"

I encourage those that purchase, THOROUGHLY test the phone, PRIOR to transferring all settings/data/tunes/vids/pics, etc. from your previous Samsung phone. After 86 days of dealing with my cell service transfer from VERIZON to TING, I failed to complete a thorough test of the phone. The Power On/Off button does not toggle properly, sticks, & and works most of the time. There is a workaround, for booting, but simple screenshooting without another app can be challenging.  The battery struggled the first 2 days, with a slow charge, and not holding charge well,  but now seems to hold the charge as well as my ancient 2018 S9.  3 months of ownership: bumper/case has solved issue of the power button problem mentioned earlier. Battery seems to work fairly well now. Though I do have days, that it seems to de-charge much quicker than other days, even though there are no apps running in the background. OVERALL, I would highly recommend purchasing a refurbed phone, rather than a new. Use the extra money to help someone truly in need, after-all it is just a phone.","October 19, 2023"

4016,Samsung Galaxy S20,rayna septinelli,5,"This phone is great - the touch screen is quick, it processes webpages and apps with ease. The size is ideal and fits comfortably in my back pocket or a small purse. This phone doesn't come with an audio jack so we had to get some adapters that plug into the power spot so we can stream music through the phone in the car which was an easy fix. The battery lasts a while and I often have tons of apps open at the same time without slowing anything down. I take a ton of pics and videos (the quality of both is really great) and haven't had an issue with storage space yet which is super awesome - I do back up all my images/video to google photos though just in case, I've lost way too much media over the years to keep it only on my phone. When taking a screenshot, there is a nice pop-up option that allows you to crop it or make edits right away, I use this function regularly and really appreciate having the option.I use it for work functions as well and can easily switch between multiple email accounts and google drive folders - downloading and opening documents is a breeze and its enhanced my ability to work remotely and on the go.As a public figure, I installed google voice so I can have a more personal and more public number and the phone handles both with ease. I also use signal, discord, facebook messenger, and whatsapp regularly to communicate with people all around the world.I love the keyboard function that allows me to switch between languages and daily switch between arabic and english with ease - sometimes in the same text, comment, or email.","August 18, 2023"

As a sacrificial anode, or canary in a coal mine, it's well worth 10 bucks to protect the factory screen.  Somehow this phone picked up a chip in the edge of the screen, before I applied the screen protector.  When I was cleaning the screen for the screen protector,  I discovered that the phones screen wasn't chipped, it was a screen protector that was already applied !  The screen protector that had already applied, saved me a ton of money!  I don't know if all phones from This seller come with already-applied screen protectors, but you should ask.","May 18, 2024"

4032,Samsung Galaxy S20,Anzenetta Marshall,4,"Got the phone, transferred the Sim and SD card from s9+ turned on and worked without any problems. Used Samsung Smart Switch and Google play to transfer apps and files from old phone to the new phone. Had to re-setup all the MFAs I use for work, but was expecting that. Love the in screen fingerprint scanner. Much easier to use then the back scanner I used on the S9+. It will miss from time to time, but especially at work where I have to do MFA authorizations many times throughout the day when connecting to user's computers and servers to check settings or perform remote fixes it is so much easier to press my thumb to the front of the screen than having to pull off the wireless charger to scan from the back. Battery life is great. Old S9+ could barely make it through a normal 8 hour shift and sometimes it wouldn't. The S20 FE makes it through a 12 hour extended shift with more than normal MFA with 27% battery still left. Can't really speak to the camera as if I am wanting to take good pictures I will pull out the Canon Rebel. For quick snaps of serial numbers, model numbers and things like that it works fine. Hands free is much clearer than on the S9+ as I don't get crackling or distortions on the S20 FE. A good phone for a refurbished one.","October 13, 2022"

I think it's because I don't use the Verizon network as the manufacturer assumed I would, but with my in-home wifi this also isn't an issue and just something to remember.","February 29, 2024"

4049,Samsung Galaxy S20,Claudine,5,"This is an update to my comments from January 15th on the seller's (bayshine trading) comments section.Now that I have been using the phone for about a month I can say that the seller went BEYOND his responsibilities in his description of the phone, the packaging he provided, his ship speed, and the inclusions of all of the stated peripherals. As I said in my initial post, his answers to my my presale questions were accurate, honest and quickly responded. When the opportunity to recommend bayshine trading I will happily do so and will no doubt being doing business with them in the future.As for the phone, it is all I expected. Great refresh specs make for an ultra smooth experience. The screen quality is a nice step up from my MOTO Edge however I did adjust the white balance and RGB settings from the default settings a tad to suit my taste. TMO's 5G network plays well with the S20 FE. I routinely experience 120 mb download speeds inside my house. In full disclosure I got about the same performance from my Edge (NOT the Edge plus) which tells me that even though I traded up a bit regarding the Snapdragon processor, that upgrade hasn't seem to have had an affect on my download speeds. As a side note, I believe the MOTO Edge is an excellent phone and proved to be a great value as long as you're not paying list for the unit. (I paid $499 and list WAS $699) I did tire of the edge-to-edge display but that is a personal taste. Also, I didn't have any of the well documented screen problems that many of the units have had.Still, the S20 FE is an upgrade to the Edge in several areas: processor, display, refresh and form factor (again, a personal taste). My Edge had more native memory (256 gb vs 128 gb) but both can close (or increase) that gap with an sd card. The Edge was nearly a pure Android experience and the S20 FE comes loaded with mucho Samsung apps and bloats. I kept some, deleted some, ignored some but this common complaint about Samsung is true - all with workable work-arounds but true.So, inconclusion if you have a $500 cell phone budget and don't mind buying a year-old model, it's hard to go wrong with this reconditioned option. Coupling the phone with a resell vendor like bayshore trading only sweetens the deal.Buy with confidence.","February 7, 2021"

4060,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,KL,5,"Pros:Industry-leading processing power and firmware.Long firmware support life.Excellent battery life.Super nice display.Charges fast.Great speakers.Great glass used for the display and back.Should be more resistant to damage, in comparison to other Samsung phones (re: s20 FE) which use the brittle Gorilla Glass 3. And even if you break it, Samsung is the Honda of phones. Parts are always cheap, readily available, and as such repairs are cheaper and easier to access.Looks good while doing all of the above.Cons:The fingerprint reader is abysmal. I'm coming from a Razer Phone 2 which read and recognized my fingerprints near instantaneously, and very reliably. Sometimes this thing just refuses to recognize my prints, or takes a good second or so to do anything about it.This camera is years behind what it was hyped up to be. On my RP2 I was running a Gcam mod and generally getting better results, ESPECIALLY in night mode. I was kind of gutted when I discovered how inferior this camera array is. Lots of noise on the wide angle, tons of focus hunting regardless of which lens you're using, just generally primitive by today's standards. Is it a hardware issue or a software issue? No idea, but it's unacceptable either way. Do NOT buy this phone for the cameras. Many cameras from a few years ago are better, especially with Gcam.The display, while beautiful, has pretty terrible viewing angles. Yet another problem I thought we left back in 2015.RAM is silly low, even by flagship standards from 2-3 years ago.Meh:Samsung is still lagging behind stock android in many ways. There are a lot of redundant and pointless apps/""features"" that are clearly just Samsung trying to trick you into giving THEM your data, rather than Google; and doing it poorly. Customization is somehow better and worse than ROMs which are closer to stock. Sammy put a few decent features in here for customizing, but not really anything you couldn't have gotten from a 3rd party. The launcher is terrible and restricting, but easy to replace. I personally use Microsoft Launcher with a bunch of 3rd party widgets, icon packs, etc.Conclusion:At the end of the day, this is a matter of price. When this phone was released for around $1k, it was insanely overpriced and not at all worth it. However, I snagged it on Prime Day for $699. At that price, I feel like it BARELY scapes past acceptable. $100 more than that and I would have returned it and waited to see what comes out later this year from other mfgs. The s21 line is bizarre to me. It blends top of the line features and tech with relatively archaic features and tech. I would not call this a flagship series, except in that Samsung does not have a higher-tiered line. This could have been much more polished, and it's sad they cut corners and had some critical oversights. But again, if you can get this for almost half of what it cost at launch retail, it's worth it. Don't expect bleeding edge performance across the board, and you should be satisfied.","July 13, 2021"
4061,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,NikNotABot,5,"I came from the Samsung A70 (a $400 phone), and coming up to a flagship is a MASSIVE difference. I liked the camera on my old phone, it was fine, but on the s21+, it is phenomenal! Just the camera upgrade is great, but the 120 refresh rate is great too. I've heard YouTubers talk about the refresh rate pretty often, so I had high expectations for it. And I got to say, the experience is very real. After about a month of using this phone, I set my screen to 60hz, to see how long I could last with the old refresh rate. The difference was immodestly. In less than an hour, I had to switch back to 120hz. The Battery life on this phone is great too. I'm not a heavy user. Normally, I'm on youtube, texting friends, check emails, etc, and the battery is more than enough for it. I also use Google Maps a lot, and by the end of the day, I have about 30-50 percent battery left.Overall, would definitely recommend this phone for anyone that is looking fro an upgrade","May 2, 2021"

4063,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,Prrakeet,5,"With the phone itself, there is pretty much no compalain.. except with the Finger Printer Reader.  I have added a 360 cover but unable to detect finger print.  Would hope Samsung to come with a more sensitive finger print sensor.With Prime Deal, it's a great deal but not the best.  I bough an S7 on Prime days 3 year ago and it was much much better deal.  Would hope to see better Prime Day deal with Samsung phones in the futureWith the shipping to Canada.  It took a bit of time, would hope to see a quicker turnaround.  Also, with my order, it was shipped the first time and somehow the courier returned it back to Amazon.  I have to call and they have to process a ""return"" to trigger a re-send.  It costs me another 3 or 5 days.  Could have been smoother but overall it's ok.  Also, the Import fee is resonable.  It charged me around 15% but sent me back a refund after.  Overall, the fee was around 11.5%, which is slightly cheaper than my provincial tax.","August 29, 2021"
4064,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,bohtur29,4,"I've never had a flagship Samsung phone, so I don't know what the standards are, but apparently this doesn't meet them. I think it's pretty cool though. It's a big upgrade from my A51 that had a bad low light camera and was getting pretty slow though I only had it for a year. This phone was $600 more than the A51 and I don't think it's worth it, but I don't think any phones worth almost or more than $1,000. The front camera is very bad sometimes because it sharpens pictures too much. But when it's good, it's like the back camera of the A51. The battery lasts 9-10 hours. The only things in the box are the sim card pin, those useless papers, a charger cord,, and the phone itself, which is ridiculous. You'll have to buy all the accessories. You'll need a USB-C charging block for the cord. It also doesn't have a headphone jack if you didn't know, so you'll need Bluetooth earbuds or an adapter. I think it's a good phone, but not worth all the money. You could likely get something from the A series or S20 series that's the same, close to, or better than this for a lower price.","October 4, 2021"

The phone CLEARLY lives up to its hype and expectations, it truly goes above and beyond of what the S20+ was... I jumped from an S7 Edge to the S21+ and let me tell you, it was a huge jump, I can feel it with every swipe. I got a Spigen case armor so the phone is a little chunky now but I rather its like that than it breaks on the frs fall. The down sides of the phone: doesnt come with a charger, doesnt come with headphone jack or headphones, doesnt come with MicroSD card slot. All of those features I knew it didnt come with, its part of the market trend. I bought the original charger at samsung store, I do have Samsung galaxy buds so the headphones I dont mind, I DO miss the MicroSD card slot but I got the 128GB phone so I think it'll be fine...","March 29, 2021"
4066,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,Alecia,5,"This S21+ is an absolutely superb piece of technology. The Phantom Silver color is professional & flawless, the size fits well in a medium sized hand, and the operation of the phone, silky smooth interface and overall power is stunning. Battery life is 2+ days with regular use. I don't buy phones for any camera quality so can't offer an opinion there, and I don't use facial or fingerprint security so no opinion there either, but for internet speed, phone volume and intuitive features this phone is arguably the best made in the world. Get the 25W PPS Samsung charger which Samsung and others highly recommend, OR the Anker 35W or 45W with PPS and GaN technology - BOTH are online or available from Best Buy if a charger is needed.","February 23, 2022"

4068,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,Todd D,1,"I bought this phone thinking it didn't really matter that I only had a 90 day warranty...I mean, it's a new Samsung Galaxy. I'd had an s7 for years and experienced NO issues at all. So I felt confident in buying the s21+ as a major upgrade. The phone itself is wonderful - I had no issues with anything at all, other than it seemed to echo at times when talking to friends. A couple weeks after owning this phone for ONE YEAR, I reach for my s21+ to make a call and I see the screen is totally black. I thought it was dead, so I put it on the charger and nothing. No lights at all on the screen. No beep when plugging it in. I could still touch the screen and hear the phone clicking/vibrating as if I was using it normally, but I couldn't see a thing. I couldn't turn the phone off, despite knowing where the buttons were from muscle memory. I couldn't force a reboot either. Nothing worked. I ran through all the generic troubleshooting from Samsung and Amazon. NOTHING AT ALL WOULD WORK TO BRING THIS PHONE BACK TO LIFE. And I wasn't going to pay $300 to have the screen replaced when this was clearly not an issue with the screen - THIS IS A KNOWN SOFTWARE PROBLEM THAT SAMSUNG APPARENTLY HAS NO INTENTION OF ADDRESSING OR FIXING. It's easy for them to say ""plug it into your laptop or PC and factory reset"" but that's IMPOSSIBLE WHEN YOU CAN'T EVEN GET THE PHONE TO BOOT UP OR BE RECOGNIZED ON YOUR PC/LAPTOP!!! I searched for weeks to determine which phone I wanted to buy - this is a big purchase item and I EXPECTED IT TO LAST FOR YEARS, CONSIDERING HOW WELL I CARE FOR MY ELECTRONICS. But I barely got 54 weeks' use out of this phone, and then I was basically thrown to the wolves because I had no warranty that could be honored and no one would help me outside of saying ""replace the screen"" or ""sell it for junk parts."" THIS PERFECTLY NEW AND (UP TO THAT POINT) PERFECTLY FUNCTIONING SMARTPHONE THAT COST HUNDREDS OF MY HARD-EARNED DOLLARS IS NOW ABSOLUTELY USELESS, OTHER THAN SERVING AS A REMINDER THAT I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER SAMSUNG NOR WILL I EVER BUY ANOTHER SMARTPHONE VIA AMAZON DUE TO THEIR LACK OF AT LEAST A 1YR WARRANTY. TO SAY THAT I AM SICK OVER THIS IS A GROSS UNDERSTATEMENT.","August 13, 2024"
4069,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,ENGELBERT MAVAREZ,4,"Features are good but  not significantly better than my 8Plus that I replaced with it in order to access 5G.  But at first I thought it does not connect to AT&T's 5G (and initially I fated only 1 star) and the AT&T technician at my store first replaced the SIM card to be sure that is not the issue, did general trouble-shooting and the phone is good, and then told me he frequently encounters phones purchased as 'unlocked' rather than locked by AT&T that will not connect to 5G.  Amazon Customer Support was entirely clueless and unhelpful, telling e to contact Samsung.  I did so and the Customer Service Rep was clueless so I asked for a Supervisor to return my call.  She did so the next day and at first wanted me to send my phone to Samsung (10 day tunaround) because she said the unlocked phone should connect toeither AT&T or T-Mobile,  but after some discussion she offered that I could also take it to my local Samsung authorized repair place (UBreakIFix) to reflash with latest software.  I went there and on entering imy phone showed connection to 5G!!  The signal in the AT&T store (Florida City, FL) apparently was not strong enough.  So I recommend this phone - the only issue that I have with it is that how to take video  is  non-intuitive and obscure, so I have yet to succeed with anything longer than a few seconds.","November 16, 2021"
4070,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,KL,4,"I freaking LOVE my new Samsung Galaxy s21+!!! My s9 of 3 years was acting up on me so it was about time I upgraded. I heard that it only includes a recharge cable but not an adaptor, which was alright since I had to replace my own a week prior to me getting this. What I don't like (which is why I gave this phone a 4 star) is that Samsung pulled an Apple and also took out the audio output to plug in your headphones! So if you love listening to music like me, get a special type c audio adaptor for the s21 and s21+. Or if you don't mind that be sure to get wireless headphones or earbuds that support Bluetooth.  Be sure to back up all your files to your Samsung account and Google accounts (like G-Photos) that way when you do the transfer (wireless or though cable connecting) you'll get everything downloaded on your phone. Reason I say this is because these newer phones don't come with a micro SD card slot anymore, Probably because of all the extra storage it already comes with. (mine is I think 182GB) All in all, I love my new phone and have no regrets!! 🥰","April 7, 2021"
4071,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,NikNotABot,5,"I was very happy with my Galaxy S9, and thus had not considered upgrading until now with 5G being rolled out ""for real"" in many locations. I was quite surprised however, when I began using the multiple camera format of this device because I was convinced that improvements to the S9 camera were unlikely. Whoa - so wrong! The range of photographing capabilities have been significantly advanced in this model and I coudn't be happier with the results I'm seeing. AI is in its infancy, yet there are applications in the camera of this device that offer real advantages with impressive results. Also the much larger battery is doing a much better job of reaching the end of my typical day with power remaining. For my purposes I am very glad that I decided to upgrade to the S21+ and I highly recommend this model.","January 18, 2022"
4072,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,Latasha Bowman,4,"Don’t get me wrong, the phone is great. At the time it was released, the display was superior to anything Apple offered and performance, camera capabilities and overall aesthetic and durability were great. However, at the time of this writing, there are many better choices for this price range- notably it’s successor, the Galaxy S22, the S21FE, and of course, the iPhone 13 and its Pro variants.If you can get a good sale on this, I would recommend it. It’s a great phone. But, for closing into $1K or even more than $700, look to newer hardware.","March 7, 2022"
4073,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,Ric C,4,"I was effectively ""forced"" to get this, due to lack of supply of other models and my carrier was no longer supporting 3G....it's a good phone for sure.  Battery life is good, photos taken so far are detailed and clear.  Transferring data from my old Note 8 was simple, although it did take a little longer than expected - but so what.  I miss the stylus from the Note series a little, but I've discovered I don't need it like I used to.  Under the circumstances, I'm happy, and glad I didn't switch to another brand.","March 15, 2022"

4075,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,Andrew Williams,1,"The phone and its features on this S21 were such an improvement over my S12 and the reviews of the phone and even the refurbished ones were excellent.  But.  Phone was purchased in May, had fallen apart by July.  Within a week:  first the camera started to separate from the back ,and I could hear the inside of the phone buttons working, which was tinny and weird.  Next, the rest of the back started to come off and the buttons for on/off, volume, etc. were flying solo out of the phone.  Return period for this phone is very short so please purchase with a big head's up from my experience.","August 2, 2024"
4076,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,Alma,2,"It's a crying shame my carrier is forcing me to ""upgrade"". I'd keep my Mate 20, which at best is an okay phone, over this s21+ any day, but the carrier won't let it work on the network as of next year. Anyways, the good, I like the display alright... there must be something else, oh, I suppose battery life is decent. I guess it is smooth and fast out of the box, but aren't they all, flagships that is. Now for what I don't like. No headphone jack, and I knew it didn't have one, but that doesn't mean I have to like it. Display aspect ratio, please quit making these phones look like a remote control. I couldn't reach the top on 5.5 in 16x9 screen, but I could reach both sides. Now I'm even farther away from the top of these sticks. All glass, hate it. Samsung bloat, not as bad as I remember, but still there. I thought the camera was supposed to be great, but I get way to many blurry photos. Fingerprint sensor is no where's near as good as any I've had on the back of a phone. Doesn't recognize it quite often. I'll miss not having an ir blaster, still used mine daily. I'll miss not having sd card slot. I'd love a removable battery, but I know I won't see on here. It's to bad, I'd love to see android phones from 5-8 years ago with modern specs any day over the current line up of iphones wanna be's. This is not an upgrade to me, it's settling for the least objectionable.","June 30, 2021"
4077,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,Alma,3,This phone is a great phone if your into the Samsung ecosystem. I know this review seems to to be not picky but if I am paying $1000 for a phone it better be amazing. Sadly Samsung did not deliver for me. This phone will push you to use more Samsung products and apps. It got really frustrating for me because I was content to using googles ecosystem. Bixby is not that good and Google assistant is so much better. This phone also has a lot of features but it feels like with this phone is that they stuffed as many features they could without having a cohesive strategy on how they work together to improve the life of the user.I will say this phone has amazing battery life and the screen movements are buttery smooth. It charges on wireless chargers fast and the screen is bright. However the skin of Android is not for me. I can see why people love the phone.,"October 30, 2021"

Had several cracks but when I removed the old screen protector it had multiple cracks in the protector but my phone was PERFECT!  Unbelievable.

The facial recognition is a little bit better but still has a high failure rate of recognition.

So basically you will need to randomly check your voicemail by dialing *86. You will not get a notification. Verizon couldn't even get their voicemail app loaded onto the phone.

4095,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,Scottie Taylor,1,"CORRECTION !!!  I purchased a Samsung Galaxy S21+ from CELL UNIVERSAL in early OCTOBER (not November). When it arrived it didn't work properly - UNLESS you consider a screen that was backwards !!  It appears not from left to right as phones do, but from RIGHT to Left. This makes things such as swiping left now require swiping right. And instead of moving the slider left to right to increase brightness, or  to increase or decrease the volume, these are backwards as well. I contacted the company CELL UNIVERSAL but got no response. When I contacted Amazon they tried to help, but all I got from CELL UNIVERSAL was questions, and no way to get a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA). After more contacts with Amazon, CELL UNIVERSAL finally sent me an address to send it back, but no RMA. Apparently they are expecting ME to pay to send it back. Overall, This company, CELL UNIVERSAL, APPEARS to be making me jump through numerous hoops without doing anything to resolve this issue. It's almost, to me, like they are trying to get me so tired of playing this game that I just give up and let them ""steal"" my $879.27 !!!  Amazon itself has been very good at trying to help with this, so it's not Amazon I'm angry at - it's strictly Cell Universal. Again, CELL UNIVERSAL is the apparent root of this problem...","November 2, 2021"

Camera must be from 2018. Fingerprint reader is quite demanding.Coming from Huawei P30 Pro, I expected 2 years worth of advancement, but alas it does feel like downgrade in every aspect.

4137,SAMSUNG Galaxy S21,Sebastian Lopez,1,"Phone stopped working (stopped reading sim card after 10 months). The Samsung webpage is dysfunctional, with it impossible to initiate the phone warranty process (tried multiple different browsers, it just sticks you in a loop that looks to me to be intentional, I'll have to find the time to wait hours on the phone some time to start the warranty process).Additionally, coming from pixel phone, I found Samsung software to be inferior to that of the pixel in nearly every case. Phone is listed as Esim capable, but is not in US. Samsung Visual voicemail is a joke , the message app is horrible. There is absolutely nothing about this phone that gave me a better experience than my much cheaper pixel phone.Between this and my Samsung TV which is shoving ads down my face, my Samsung refrigerator whose icemaker freezes over every week, and this completely disappointment of a phone, if I never own another Samsung product again, it will be too soon.","October 24, 2021"

4186,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Domestic Pianist,4,"This is an amazing phone with some serious pros and cons.  The pros are that it's like having a tablet that you can carry around all day.  I love it, and that I can get so much work done on long subway trips.  If you are someone who has the time to sit and work while ""on the go"", you will love it.  I prefer to flip it sideways for better/wider viewing once it is open.  Past that, you have likely heard of the other pros.  As for the cons, this is not a phone to buy used.  I spend much of my year overseas and in Korea, where the various Folds and Flips have been out for several years.  I know several other business people with Fold 3's, 4's, and they are now getting the 5's.  I also know many young university students with Flip 3's, and 4's.  What you have to know about these phones is that the inner screen is incredibly fragile, as is the video transmission cable.  They make a big deal about the hinge, but the real problems are with needing to replace the thin inner screen or cable.  The factory screen protector needs occasional replacement (8 months shows bubbling), which means giving up your phone and waiting to have it done (or shipping out) and paying for it.  Then, in colder seasons, screens tend to wear out inside of 1 to 2 years, or start to fray along the corners and at the hinge points. Basically, know that you really should get Samsung Care with this phone, or plan to get rid of it by 1 to 2 years.  Otherwise, once you exceed the base screen warranty, you will pay a ridiculous amount to replace it.  Knowing this, it is just not a good ""long term"" phone for those who like to hold onto it for years and years.  Replacing that film becomes prohibitively expensive to keep up, and a full inner screen replacement is like buying a new phone if you don't have Samsung Care.  Likewise, the used value on the Fold phones is atrocious.  How bad?  In Korea, a 1-year old Fold 4 sells for $600 or less.  That's almost a 2/3 loss in value inside of a year!  The reason why is because anyone who purchases it used will have to worry about hundreds of dollars in inner screen replacements, ribbon cable fixing, and have absolutely no coverage for them.  Despite how awesome this phone is, I think it's development was Samsung attempting to create a device that can bring in more repair profit, and shoehorn users into paying for Samsung Care.  They want you buying new phones more often, buying additional warranties, or paying through the nose for repairs.  That's really what the Fold and Flip are about.  If you have the money to burn, and don't mind upgrading every year or investing in Samsung Care and keeping it a bit longer, this phone is incredible.  For all others -- avoid it.","October 16, 2023"
4187,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Amber Kurt,4,"In general, I like the phone. Performance is good with this, at least in the US. I was using my carrier's roaming partner in Spain with their limited data and it was just so-so - I was attaching to 5g network, but performance was limited due to agreements. It worked fine for phone calls though.Screens are beautiful, crisp and vivid. The internal screen is just ""big"" and makes many things easier to use. That being said, not all apps use the space as well. The Speed Test app uses it to pop out additional information. From my understanding it is possible to do split screen apps as well, though I never did.The camera is the standard Samsung which I personally like. Some sample pictures are attached. Some may think colors are more saturated, thought the sky in the included church picture I took was actually that blue that day. Zoom is also fairly good - I included a 10x example of La Sagrada Familia.Speed tests were decent, again more of a reflection of the network. Home WIFI performance is on par or on the higher side for my network.The phone geometry takes a bit to get used to and I initially found the phone a bit slippery. It is very tall and popped out of my pocket a few times (shallow pocket). I ended up dropping the phone about 5 times the first day I got it, before I received my case. Good news is that it survived all drops well with no scratches and intact screens. Most drops were from the 3 to 4 ft range.That is another thing, and could be due to popularity as well as design. Getting a good case is not as easy as with non-folding phones. Some cases do not protect the ""binding""/edge part of the phone as well and others that fold leave a lot of space in that area which expose the outside edge of the screen.There are two things I do not like about this phone.First, the fingerprint sensor is in the on/off button, and it is not that good, at least compared to the on-screen sensor in my S22-Ultra.  It had a hard time reading my fingerprint and the placement is hard to use correctly but easy to accidentally set off where you then have to enter your pin anyway as you had too many bad reads.Second, the keyboard on the front screen is small and it is easy to mis-type letters. Even after using for over a month, I still make more mistakes than I did with my S-22 Ultra.","September 27, 2023"

4190,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Amazon Customer,5,"I'm gonna be honest, I'm a big tech guy and I've been following all kinds of smart devices and smart home configs and smart watches and computers and everything else for years, but this was my first experience using a folding phone, and it was incredible.The inner screen looked incredible and seemed very durable to me, I didn't do any kind of durability test on it or anything, but just from general use watching TV shows and playing games on it, I noticed no wear and tear at all.All the apps I tried to use did an amazing job resizing to fit the inner screen size, and I didn't have any apps that only did a partial screen fit which was really cool to see, so the app support is definitely there which is great.The inner camera definitely isn't like super great (especially for selfies), but if you take your pictures in a well-lit area they turn out significantly better. That being said, the general consensus from most of the people I talked to about this phone said it's recommended to only use the inner camera for video calls, and for selfies to just use the much better cameras on the outside of the device instead (there's a way to ""send the screen"" to the back (outside) of the phone and take selfies using the main lens instead, and those turned out incredible. Like seriously better than almost any other phone I've used.The last thing I just want to add is be prepared to adjust some of the default settings. First off, the screen would dim way more often than I wanted it to, so make sure to adjust it up to 2 minutes before it goes to sleep instead of 30 seconds. The other default setting to adjust is default brightness, go in and turn that off and turn on the extra brightness option and then set it to a comfortable brightness level. I think this phone keeps the auto brightness low all the time to save battery life, but it definitely ruins the experience a bit when your phone is that dim for no reason.Overall though, this phone is amazing and I couldn't be happier with it. The storage amount was fine, the camera quality was great, the battery was pretty good, the inner screen was amazing, and the phone was such a phenomenal experience to use every day.10/10, definitely recommend, get this phone, you will not be disappointed!","September 12, 2023"
4191,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Joseph Manfredonia,4,"iPhone user so this is a big change and to be fair I am reviewing this for all but the cellular part. I have yet to get a new SIM for it and have been using it on wifi. The screen, colors are amazing, bright and beautiful.  The fold function is pretty awesome.  It's like carrying around a mini iPad.  The case I am using on it, the I just reviewed has a kickstand so can you pop it anywhere and watch streaming content.  Form factor is good for its size.  Height wise it is just a bit taller than my iPhone 13Pro.  Thickness folded is more than double the size.  The snap on case also adds to the overall heft.  For those that have both android and apple there is an app that allows you to send and receive imessages on android so that has eased the transition for me. The device is pretty responsive with about 30 apps on it so far.  Camera is sharp.  Wireless charging is uses the fast charging standard and the device tells you when it is in fast charge mode. A few things I don't like.  From a device hardware perspective the camera facial recognition is not great. It fails more than it works. The fingerprint sensor works about 90% of the time.  Battery life is average.  For whatI am using it for it drains pretty quickly.  The rest of the dislikes are really around android and while I know the implementation is customized for the device I cannot really give the device negative marks for it.  If they could get native iMessage in android I would sonisdr switching.","August 25, 2023"
4192,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Michael McNulty,4,"I was skeptical about ordering this phone because I have been using an Apple phone for years, and I have many Apple devices that I use daily, but now, I must admit, I'm pleasantly surprised.First of all, this phone has a unique design that Apple never had, It has a folding design, I was quite amazed that it is such a compact phone that fits in any pocket and magically transforms into a tablet. This foldable technology is really awesome. According to the Samsung official, it's tested for 200,000 fold, which means I can fold the phone over 100 times a day in 5 years, and it is still functional.  The cover screen is 6.2 inches the inner screen is 7.6 inches, and the inner screen comes with a built-in protector.When we talk about the cameras, the iPhone's photos seem a little yellowish and not very vibrant. The Samsung phone's pictures appear brighter and maybe more appealing, but they have slightly less contrast. Taking photos at night can be challenging for phones, but both of these phones do a good job. In the low-light pictures I took of a vase, the iPhone 14 Pro Max makes some details look overly sharp, and the colors are accurate but not very bold.I found that the Galaxy Z Fold 5 has only one slot for a SIM card, even though some people thought it could have two SIM cards for US models. Overall, I really like this phone. If I discover any new information about it, I'll be sure to share updates.","September 8, 2023"
4193,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Customer Review,5,I have been team apple for over 5 years switching from a oneplus phone back in early 2018. I thought no phone would ever win me back but the samsung fold offerings have always been intriguing to me. I did find it hard to overlook that ugly middle line especially with the older phones not folding in flat. Now that the fold 5 has offered this upgrade to actually fold flat I decided that now more than any time I would test the waters of a Android Device.The Fold 5 was easy enough to get used to it felt quite natural using the front screen for some simple stuff and opening it up for the full screen experience. It did at times feel weird watching content on such a large phone screen but it was mostly a mix of delight and amazement at how top notch the folding screen is.The camera was quite good to my amazement as I had been spoiled with the apple camera for a while. I had not seen the advancements android phones had made and I was delighted to use the zoom on the phones camera. Overall though i don't like the colors quite as much and I feel the photos have a little less character than an iphone but still a great camera with many more cool gimmicks than the iphone a big win in my book.I was a little concerned about weight when i got the phone but in hand it didnt feel as heavy as i thought. The bigness of the phone was a little daunting at first as it was both thicker and longer. This is definitely a big disadvantage to me as the bulge is quite apparent in most of my pants even though it is a narrower phone when folded up.I do want to quickly also say this phone does look beautiful and the bevels are so small now on these phones the screen looks amazing. Even though at times i see the curve of the large screen it doesnt bother as much as i though tit would only when things go dark do i really see it noticeably. The screen is also very bright.Positives: Great ScreenFast Snappy PerformanceFast ChargingNegatives: Front Screen is a little narrow (not good for typing)I did not get great battery life even when new about 1 day but many times didnt make it to the day mark. that comfortably.,"September 3, 2023"
4194,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Customer Review,5,"I’ve been using this phone for 3 weeks now and I absolutely love it. HIGHLY recommend this phone if you are into work productivity OR into gaming, as it does both with ease. I’ve always been an iPhone and iPad kinda person, but this Samsung phone is literally like carrying a powerful laptop in your pocket. I’ve been playing Pokemon Go, Pikmin Bloom, and Golf Clash while logging my walks on Runkeeper, chatting with work folks using Slack, engaged in Teams or Zoom meetings, opening MS Word and PPTX docs - this phone does it all.  I’m not even using a cell connection yet, I'm just piggybacking on my work iPhone hotspot, and yet this Z-fold outperforms it!  At 256GB, this phone goes above and beyond the processing capability of my other phones.The large, beautiful Z-fold screen makes this phone so unique, and adds extra usability. It’s like having a mini-tablet and a cell phone all rolled into one!  The “back” screen is the tall narrow single screen that is utilized when the phone is folded/closed, and the “front” screen is the large rectangular screen that is twice as wide and very useful for work applications like word processing, slide shows and spreadsheets, and not to mention video calls. I like that it folds up small to fit in my pocket, and then folds out to give me a nice, big display screen when I need one.If you are thinking of investing in this phone, do keep in mind that it is heavy and slick, so if you plan on having it last, please invest in a case sooner rather than later!And lastly, the camera takes nice sharp photos, the phone has a very high quality screen display, and this phone also utilizes facial recognition as well as fingerprint technology, both of which have worked great for me - no issues there. Charging time is about the same as my other phones, BUT this phone seems to have a superior battery life compared to my other phones. For instance, under similar circumstances, the Z fold will still be at 70% while my other phones are already down to 40%!Overall, I think this unique phone is one of the best phones I have ever had, certainly one of the most versatile!","August 31, 2023"
4195,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Dilys Queen,4,"As a long term apple user (phones and computers) this was a bit of a leap of faith for me. While everyone around me uses iPhones, it is great for communication via text but the call quality is just awful. And because I work a lot on a tablet I was really intrigued by the design of this product and the giant screen.I'm not going to lie, I had a lot to overcome here to figure this out essentially staring out as a brand new user with a brand new interface. I was really happy to learn that I could just pop in the SIM card from my iPhone and into this one! Mind you I have an unlocked phone with T-Mobile.The phone itself is beautiful and feels great in my hand. But the screen, the screen is so impressive. Like I said, it look a long time to setup and I'm not fully converted yet, but I do really like this phone.I just hate that for all my iPhone friends, we have to use WhatsApp to video chat, and send text.","October 27, 2023"
4196,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Dilys Queen,1,"I have had 2 reviews taken down so far on the Samsung website with no notification  had even been taken down let alone why.This is a second review I had written that got taken down off of the Samsung website:I had posted a 2 star review but after seeing it was missing even though it said it was live, I will write a new one. The battery life is bad. The outer screen is bad. If you have fat fingers DO NOT buy this phone. The camera is disappointing considering the one on my S21 Ultra was better(3 year old phone.) Maybe in a couple years they'll get it right, but right now. This isn't the one to get. A foldable itself is AWESOME, but this one makes you compromise, and as one of the most expensive Samsung phones, it isn't worth it.","April 1, 2024"
4197,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,William Sung,4,"Pros:No more space in the hinge between the screens. Less worried about putting the phone in my back pocket now. It can definitely handle more weight on it since it folds completely flat now but I still try to keep my phone in the front pocket. Just helpful to know it can handle more pressure like when it's in my bag.Very bright screen, noticeable brighter than the fold 4 both inside screen and outside as well.Cons:Not much better in terms so hardware. The ultra s23 still has the better camera.There is still the crease you can see, especially from side angle. Works well if you're the only one looking at the inside screen but multiple people makes this an eyesore.Battery life is similar to the Fold 4 so no major improvements there.","August 31, 2023"
4198,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Trevor K Smith,5,"You certainly won't be buying this because of its (not) low price. But it provides a lot of features and especially unique extra ways to use all of its screen space. Almost all of my smart device usage has been in the IOS world ... and so a lot of what I am experiencing right now is just getting used to this new, slightly different way of doing things. But I am certainly not disappointed by anything thus far.My foremost favorite feature so far is just in the extra large, brilliant screen that this device has to offer. I suffer with some eye issues, but this large screen allows me to enlarge things to a size that is comfortable to view. Just this morning I was able to use it as my Sunday morning church service (digital) Bible which was so much easier to read than the paper version I had used previously. And even though it can be opened to be about half the size of a tablet for easy viewing, it can still be folded to easily fit into my shirt pocket. Plus it has powerful functionality in either format.With just a few days of usage I certainly can't say that I have explored anything more than the top surface layer of this super powerful device. But I am looking forward to getting acquainted with all that it can do once I get it more completely set up and configured to match my tastes and requirements. If you have the deep pockets necessary to invest in this device, I am very doubtful that you will be disappointed in all the things it is capable of doing for you. The days of having an almost unbelievable amount of connecting and computing power in your pocket are definitely here.","August 21, 2023"
4199,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Suzie Miller,2,"I had to make a warrenty claim on the first fold 5 because it had major software issues that didn't fix with updates. My replacement fold 5, has the exact issues. Frozen screen apps freezing screen not transfeing correctly. The screen sometimes doesn't sense your finger. I Normally don't post bad reviews. I'm very dissapointed that I switched to this and hope this review helps avoid the headaches I've had.","February 23, 2024"
4200,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Roger Baxter,5,"The Galaxy Z Fold 5 has a sleek and modern design. It is made of high-quality materials, including aluminum and glass. The phone is also very durable, thanks to its Armor Aluminum frame and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus+ displays. The display is very sharp and clear, and it is perfect for watching videos, playing games, and browsing the web. The processor is very fast and powerful, and it can handle even the most demanding tasks with ease. The phone also has 12GB of RAM and up to 512GB of storage. The camera system on the Galaxy Z Fold 5 is excellent. It takes great photos and videos in all lighting conditions. The main camera is especially good at taking low-light photos. The software is very well-optimized for the foldable design, I can use two apps side-by-side, or I can use the phone in half-folded mode to watch videos or take selfies. The battery life is good, but it is not great. You can easily get through a day on a single charge, but you may need to top it off if you are using the phone heavily. Overall I am very happy with my phone.","October 29, 2023"
4201,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Roger Baxter,5,First off this phone IMO is a work of art. Just holding it in your hand you can tell it’s a solid phone. The screens displays are very vibrant and clean. I am use to the other OS so this is a new world to me. I now have settings for settings LOL. I can set things up for my preferences the way I want and use. Split screen is still confusing to me so I won’t go there. One of the first apps I went to install was a game. It had issues where the game was set up for a different screen resolution. I couldn’t do anything with the outer borders. I was discouraged till I found a setting for apps. You could set individual apps to run in different screen settings. Full that I already know was not working for my app. Then there was 4x3 and 16x9. With the app set to 16x9 the all worked flawless. There are so many settings if something is not how you want it. You can explore or google what you want. This just might be the wedge to keep me away from the other OS for good.I am having minor issues with face recognition not working too well especially in low light. Along with the finger print reader not working all the time. I am working with equipment I’m not use to. I will redo the both it could be my error. I only mentioned here incase others are having the same issue. From me this phone gets a solid 5 stars,"August 21, 2023"
4202,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Thedude,5,"So I'm upgrading my phone from the z fold 4 so I feel I can give some insights on difference. Until seeing them side by side I really didn't realize how much slimmer they look because the crease folds flat instead of having that extra kind of bump on the outer side of it where it didn't fold flat before. It definitely feels just a little bit lighter when you hold it which is overall nice because let's face it these are incredibly bulky phones when they're folded up together. That really does feel like the biggest difference between the previous generation and the current phone. But it really makes a difference in how you use it. If you're going back and forth between getting the previous generation and the new one I'm definitely going to say lean towards the 5. The way it feels, the responsiveness, the screen brightness are all going to be an upgrade from the previous phone and it's definitely noticeable when you're using it all day. It's a great phone and I look forward to how much further they take them.If you currently have the 4 it's not a necessary update but a nice one. If you have the 3 it's definitely worth the upgrade. And if you're still looking for a foldable this is great one to use. The multitasking functionalities are amazing and well integrated and definitely makes it feel more like a portable tablet then just a phone.","August 17, 2023"
4203,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,JM,5,"This phone is absolutely amazing! I have had iPhones for almost 10 years and this phone made me change my mind about iOS. My favorite feature so far is just how big the screen is and its functionality. You can set it up so that you are running three apps at the same time so you won't miss any action. While I love leaving it unfolded and using it that way, I am loving the front screen more and more. Glide texting is super smooth and the screen quality is unreal. With the screen off there is a very noticeable crease but it virtually disappears when you turn it one. I don't even notice it 90% of the time. I was able to connect my Galaxy watch with no problems and they're working very well together.Setting the phone up was as easy as installing my SIM card. The phone restarted automatically and then I was able to start using everything right away. On T-Mobile, my speeds have been unreal. The phone itself is very responsive and fast and I'm having a much smoother experience than every before.The picture quality is great as is the video quality. I just can't complement the screen enough on how amazing it truly is. The sound quality is also up there and overall it's an entertainment machine.I am super impressed with everything so far and the battery life has been great. It has definitely lasted all day with heavy use.","August 18, 2023"
4204,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,John,3,"This phone is not very ergonomic to hold so people with carpal tunnel issues should avoid. It is extremely difficult to type on it because of the over sensitive keyboard. I've been having troubles with it randomly opening split screens on its own.It has three screens. The front facing and then the two joined panels when you fold it out. The front facing screen is WAY too thin to do basic work on it, so you practically always have to unfold your phone to do anything.Furthermore the image quality of the cameras is pretty unremarkable. It's fuzzy and not very clear. I expected better performance from itPros: it has a task bar that lets you switch between tasks easily, and there are some gestures that are essential to making this phone work like putting your palm in the screen to shut it down. There is not any documentation provided with the phone so you have to learn these from YouTube.The split screens can be both up and down or left to right. However due to the resolution of the screen, no matter what, you will always have black bars when you watch things like YouTube. It can never truly be ""full screen"" which frankly looks ugly.There's just too many nitpicks I have on this phone that make it not as convenient for me to use compared to my old, less flashy galaxy note 9. Oh also this doesn't come with the stylus pen, you have to get that yourself but frankly even after buying one I didn't think it helped optimize my usage for this phone","August 28, 2023"
4205,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Pamperwithrachel,1,This phone not ready for market screen is unreliable so much problems that no tech support from samsung !,"March 9, 2024"
4206,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,HG,5,"I am a long time iPhone user, but honestly I am incredibly impressed by this galaxy phone! The inside screen is huge and you cannot see the fold on it while it is open and you are using the screen. The brightness and crispness of the screen is excellent, I love using it for watching videos and playing games!The battery lasts me almost an entire day, but I usually end up having to plug it in after dinner. I’ve noticed when I use the bigger inside screen it loses battery more quickly than when I’m just using the outside “back” screen.I don’t love the size, girls pockets are small enough as is, and this is much more bulky than my iPhone so it’s hard to fit it in my pocket.The photos I’ve taken with the back/outside camera are incredible! To be honest I think they are better than my iPhone. The photos I’ve taken with the inside of selfie camera are terrible.Overall I’m not ready to switch over from iPhone to galaxy yet, but I’m not opposed to it either. The galaxy phone is very impressive.","September 23, 2023"
4207,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,keith howard,5,This phone has a clear screen. Amazing cameras and a long lasting battery. When unfolded the screen is clear and easy to read. It is sensitive to touch and works well. When unfolded there is a small crease in the screen that is noticeable at times but not distracting. Thicker than most phones this does not fit in standard car phone holders. Adding the optional stylus adds even more function.,"October 20, 2023"
4208,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Trevor K Smith,5,"Being an iPhone user since the beginning of time I have honestly never really used any other type of phone. I needed a second one so I decided to give the Samsung Galaxy a try as I heard good things, saw good reviews and it looked awesome. Wow!  This phone does not disappoint.  Picture is crisp, sound is clear, and camera is tight. I was a little eerie about a split screen but it works perfect. And the size is great for watching movies when traveling. My favorite feature though has to be dual app viewing. I didn’t realize how much I needed this until I started using it. Overall this is an awesome phone. If you need to step away from the I universe or you want to be a part of both like me, this is a great phone to have. It truly is next level.","August 15, 2023"
4209,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Thors Dad,2,Overall i do like the phone and its functionality. But myself and many others have had issues with pixels in the crevis of the fold dying. Samsungs customer service is absolutely atrocious and the only way to claim warranty is to sit on the phone for 45 min to an hour.,"November 9, 2023"
4210,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Gregory Kent,5,The Samsung Z Fold5 is turning out to be one of the best phones I’ve seen and had. The first thing I noticed was the width of the phone and the flexibility to fold the phone. The phone is very slim when it’s extended out flat. The cinematic screen is big and has the most clear and vibrant colors to it. With dual view I can share my screen and work on two things. It has a large storage capability. I definitely recommend upgrading to the new version of Galaxy Z Fold5. There is a lot new for me to explore and it makes it all very exciting.,"August 26, 2023"
4211,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Gregory Kent,5,"I love my Fold 5! I had the 3 and upgraded when this one came out. The screen is amazing, showing full screen without any signs of the fold in the screen. It is sturdily built and designed, surviving drops and falls. The memory seems to be never-ending. The speed is fantastic and there is rarely a problem with any lagging or dropping. The speaker sound is great, even without a bluetooth device synced. The call quality is very clear. The factory color is nice. There is no lag when using earbuds or headphones. I am very pleased with my Fold 5!","September 21, 2023"
4212,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Keaton,5,"I had to hook this up with my provider. That took a few days and I was able to keep my phone number. I will say I’m not an android user. The first thing I noticed is that this phone is not big and bulky. It opens and lays flat. This has a great camera. My pictures are crisp and clear. I like to play games on my phone and so far it holds a charge a long time. My grandson wants to use this for drawing. I can’t speak on that. I am not very technical and I apologize. I will say it is performing well for the features I use and I am learning new techniques each day. For people that like the newest gadget, this is worth exploring.","August 18, 2023"
4213,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Francisca zuniga,5,"This device is extremely high quality and has really been refined from previous models.  Looks great, can't even see a crease in the device, and it is HUGE when opened!  Display is bright/flashy, and battery life is pretty good for such a big device.  Camera isn't quite on the S23 level, but definitely sufficient for everyday non-professional use.  We love this device so far and don't know if we can ever go back to a standard smartphone!","September 8, 2023"
4214,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Francisca zuniga,5,"This is the most amazing phone ever and opens into the nicest little tablet, but also could replace my desktop computer.  From the first photo that I posted, are the CPU Benchmarks that shows this benches over 20,000 (Geekbench 4 score) and honestly this is just mind blowing!  I have a desktop computer that I use for graphic design where I need all of the big name design programs that require a lot of processing power and my desktop is fast, but it only scores 14,000.  When I saw the benchmarks of this phone and ran the tests several times, it really has me thinking that this could replace my desktop computer since the scores are 40% faster!  This phone supports Samsung DeX which is a desktop mode that allows the same experience as a desktop computer to utilize all of your apps on the phone with a seamless interface.  So that would mean you could keep your computer with you at all times.  In my photos that I posted, you can see that I attached a USB-C cord to the phone and a portable monitor, this was an immediate connection without any fussing.  Well, kinda, my monitor is too low a resolution for it to work properly, so when doing so, a higher resolution monitor is needed.Aside from using it as a computer, the phone quality is pretty amazing.  Having the ability to unfold a phone into a tablet is a great experience.  I was a bit concerned with the screen crease, but when using it, you really cannot see the crease at all.  When the phone is off, yes, you can see it and feel a slight bump when swiping across the screen.  The color and clarity is beautiful and it performs beyond expectations.  I also did some graphics testing to see the raytracing capabilities and the overall score was 5,623 and the Wild Life Extreme test which is 90% better than any other device available today! (according to 3DMARK Solar Bay test).  When doing these tests, I did notice that the phone got noticeably warm so I measured it at over 103 degrees, see photo.While I like to do testing of CPU and Graphics abilities, that is where my tech ends.  The other features and specs I am sure you can find via the manufacturer.  But from a user point of view, I find the camera to be better than any other phone that I have had.  I snapped some photos of flowers and yard ornaments to display the photo quality, and of course my cat wanted to be involved too.When using the phone. I do find that it is quite narrow and for fat finger typing it is a bit tight.  When unfolding the phone I see that it is not perfectly square, it is about 1/2 inch different.  So if they would have put the fold the other direction, then the phone would be wider and shorter and in my opinion far superior to the orientation that it is now.  It would have made it much easier to type on and better fitting in my pocket.  The phone is very glossy and slippery, much to slippery to the point that I am very concerned about it slipping out of my hand when using it.  So I will be looking for that perfect case right away!  The three camera lenses on the back are raised from the phone so when setting it down, it is at quite a tilt and directly on the lens, so that seems like a risk of damage as well.Opening and folding the phone is very stiff and I find that it requires two hands to carefully pry open and when closing I have to put pressure on the inside screen fold and carefully clack it shut.  The hinge is metal and seems engineered very well.  I thought that the inner screen would have a noticeable gap underneath when folding, but this is not the case.  I see no risk of getting debris under the screen so this is a welcome update.Even though you can unfold this phone, it really is not very thick and when unfolded it is quite thin.  It fits nicely in my hand as well as my pocket when folded.  It is lightweight and not cumbersome whatsoever.  The front screen is very touch responsive and vivid color and fast.  There is a sim card slot on the side, which is different than others.  There is space for two, but the first sim slot is blocked out, as that is reserved for the esim, but there is an actual slot for a sim card.  There is not a micro SD slot, so that was kind of a disappointment.  The stereo speakers are quite amazing as there is noticeable bass and this gives it a deep rich sound and even at the highest volume there was no distortion.Overall this is hands down the most amazing phone that I have ever used.  Samsung really did get this right.  You can tell they put a lot of thought into the engineering and polishing of the design as well as the software to allow for the larger screen.  Also to be able to replace your desktop, this phone is a real contender, especially the fact that it is much faster than my current desktop computer.  With all that said, honestly, I cannot find one single flaw aside from it being slippery, but a good case should cure that.","August 23, 2023"
4215,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,dawnn,5,"I've been a Samsung Galaxy user for a good many years now, previously was using the S20 before this. While the outside screen is slimmer than my previous phone, being able to unfold and have an even bigger screen is great. Also much better on my eyes as I am not squinting. It is much easier to browse the internet and I love the dual screen option. That itself is awesome to be able to do on the phone. Sound quality is good. Photo quality is great, plus you have an array of photo and video settings to get the perfect image. Using the phone is easy to do.","October 2, 2023"

The middle screen folds open and looks virtually the same as a small tablet. It's very impressive. It has great graphics, and the sound is better than I expected. The camera is also quite impressive. It's just a little heavier than my previous phone, but it still fits well in my front pocket. I'm very pleased with this phone.","August 12, 2023"

First they changed the charger port of the phone to share with the phone's earbud sound port, so now you can either charge your phone OR listen to music with your earbud/ earphone, not BOTH. This is just super inconvenience and makes no sense, this is a downgrade, definitely not an upgrade.

4260,Samsung Galaxy S4,hani shamoon,5,"The Good: The Samsung Galaxy S4 has Android 4.2.2, a fantastic camera, a powerful quad-core processor, and software solutions for just about every scenario; including working as a TV/DVR remote. It's comfortable in your hand and has NFC, a user-replaceable battery, and a microSD storage slot. It also has a little larger screen than it's predecessor.The Bad: Its screen is a bit dimmer than competitors' but not too much. You may not even notice it. I found the Galaxy S4's power button turned on at undesirable times. If you were a critic of the GS3's plastic construction, you'll be disappointed with this one as well. Not a game changer for me though.I think it offers a little more give if you drop it. A long list of software features could overwhelm and confuse the inexperienced user.The Ugly: Not a thing ugly about this phone!The bottom line: Its laundry list of features require time and effort to truly master, but the Galaxy S4 is the top choice for anyone looking for a big-screen, do-everything smartphone. Lastly, just in case you're wondering, an S Pen won't work on the GS4 due to the lack of Wacom digitizer, but the C-Pen and other capacitive styli should function perfectly fine.","January 2, 2014"

4272,Samsung Galaxy S6,JD91,5,"The Galaxy S6 is an outstanding smartphone.  Not to be confused with its sibling, the S6 Edge, it makes up for the lack of a touch screen that extends to the sides of the phone with its lower price.  Otherwise the phones are identical in features and capabilities which are long and impressive.  The screen, with is slightly larger than the S5, is bright and, to date, has the highest resolution of any smartphone and is extremely responsive with virtually no noticeable lag when touched.  Although it does not have the Snapdragon processor, which is the fastest in the industry, it does have two slower quad-core processors working in tandem which gives the phone phenomenal speed and multitasking capabilities.  The improvements added since the S5 are built-in wireless charging capabilities that meet the Q1 standard, Gorilla Glass 4, the latest shock resistant touch glass from Corning.  The already impressive camera is improved with an increased aperture enabling a greater sensitivity to ambient light and much wider pictures to accompany a superb auto focusing system.  And addressing the complaints of the S5's plastic case, the S6 has a thinner and lighter aluminum body.  The thinner body also makes the S6 ideal for use with a protective case or shell.  Lastly, the latest version of Android seems perfectly suited for each feature of the phone, especially the S6 Edge, making it more than a match for Apple's iPhone 6 in both speed and ease of use while exceeding it in capabilities and functionality.However, the S6 does have its drawbacks but they are few.  Like the S4 and S5, the battery life is pretty much just below average, most likely due to supporting the twin processors and that bright, hi-res screen.  But unlike the S4 and S5, the battery in the S6 is not removable so you can't upgrade it with an increased capacity aftermarket version.  This is most like due to the wireless charging capability.  Samsung claims to combat this issue with built-in power management software that can extend battery life, enable rapid charging and improve battery performance as it learns the characteristics of the battery in conjunction with your usage patterns.  I can attest that the S6 does charge fairly quickly although slightly slower using wireless charging.  And Q1 wireless charging can be a quirky since the power adapter must match the amperage and voltage of the Samsung S6 adapter precisely for it to work reliably. If you're intent on using wireless charging, I recommend using a Q1 charger with an extra Samsung S6 adapter.  It also only has a single, although highly capable, speaker which is surprisingly loud considering its small size.  Like the S5, the S6 delivers much better high fidelity stereo sound when using the speaker jack or a bluetooth speaker/headphone connection.  Another drawback is that the S6 has no MicroSD card slot so you are limited to built-in memory.  However, Samsung does offer three memory options (32, 64 and 128 GB) as opposed to the usual two (16 / 32 or 32 / 64 GB) which entail additional costs with each increase in memory (another reason to opt for an S6 with increased memory as opposed to an S6 Edge for the same price).Overall, the S6 is an excellent response from Samsung after the unimpressive sales performance of the S5.  While the S6 Edge is definitely the best looking smartphone on the market, you may not find its side areas worth the added expense when compared to the normal S6.  The regular S6, though, has the edge (no pun intended) over its more glamorous sibling simply because the additional money required to purchased an Edge can be used to increase the built-in memory which, in my opinion, will do more to extend the functional life of the phone giving you more room for applications and other software.  I definitely consider this phone to be the best on the market to date and have no problem recommending it for anyone looking for a phone packed with features and capabilities.","July 14, 2015"
4273,Samsung Galaxy S6,Mattressburn,5,"Very impressed with not only this, but also the distributer for it. I was very hesitant on purchasing a phone second hand, as this was my first android device, and also the first phone I bought off-contract, so i wanted to be sure i was satisfied. To my surprise, this phone came in in AMAZING condition, with no scratches on the glass front or back, and all the buttons and ports working perfectly. The only blemishes are on the top and bottom rails, but I definitely did not mind this since it's a lot better than the glass being scratched. The one biggest fear I had was the battery condition, as I have learned from previous experience that phone batteries are always the first thing to go. And again, the battery in this phone was in exceptional condition, so no need to change it out!Now on to the phone, the phone is your standard top-of-the-line flagship and it definitely has beaten any phones i have previously used. The screen is VERY bright and the colors are fantastic, and the 1440p display really shows the capabilities of this device. I waited a little over a month before posting a review to be sure the phone had no 'surprises' soon after i got it, as that sometimes happens with used devices, however i am very pleased with this and highly recommend anyone to purchase this phone, and do not fear buying it used as long as you can see the device before buying it.The only complaints i have to this phone is 1. the battery, as stated above, is not removable. The battery life definitely isn't the best, but if you pick up a fast charger like i did, you'll instantly forgive it. I have work and school and have made it to the end of the day without killing the battery, which is good enough for me. 2. While it may be different per person, the seller i purchased my phone from stated it came with a generic charger, in which is true. I do recommend picking up a fast charger, however i do wish the seller included it. Nevertheless, that is a small complaint because they are very cheap and easy to get, in the end, i recommend this phone highly, even by today's standards it holds up very well against other phones, and even my sister who has a 6s loves using this!","August 9, 2016"
4274,Samsung Galaxy S6,JD91,4,"This phone was purchased on December 09, 2015 from Amazon and it was delivered on December 11, 2015.  I chose the 128GB version  because Samsung chose not to give the purchaser the ability to add a micro SD card.Over the years I have had many cell phones. Sony, Casio and Motorola and now my second Samsung.  My first Samsung (S5) was returned within days due to a factory problem.I ordered a Otterbox Commuter case when I purchased my S6 and it works great and is still small enough to fit in my pocket when I go out.Pros:**The phone is a comfortable size for my hand  (2.78 inches, 0.27 inches, 5.65 inches)  and has a good size screen and the resolution is fantastic. Everything looks incredibly sharp and vibrant on this phone.**Easy to use UI that is not very different from any other android phone and very easy to use.**The camera takes the best pictures of any cell phone I have every owned and has some great features if you take pictures constantly you will really like this camera**The availability of the Samsung wireless charger which I have and love.**I use my phone as a hotspot for my tablet all day long and so far have had no problem with the battery running down before the end of the day.Cons:**No SD card slot therefore you can not expand your memory beyond 16GB, 32GB or the 128GB phone you purchased.  If you save a lot of items to your phone you may run out of memory quicker that you think.  Some of us choose NOT to send our personal information to the cloud and would like the ability to save everything to our phone with out having to spend an extra couple of hundred dollars to get the extra memory space.**The battery is not removable.  I like to hold on to my phone as long as possible before purchasing a new one.  The limiting factor seems to be the battery life.  On previous phones I could just go to Amazon and find a new OEM battey for my phone an drop it in but, with this phone that is not a available option.The single biggest CON I have for this phone is that on February 1, 2015 (just 52 days after getting it) my new S6 lost all google services.  No google search, google play store, google apps or any other other items associated with google worked at all.  At the end of three days of researching and numerous phone calls (called my carrier, Google, Samsung)  my S6 was able to be fixed by the third Samsung representative at the local Best Buy.  Just in case this happens to anyone else I will include the steps she had to take to fix my phone.1: Log out of G-Mail.2: Update firmware (the Samsung rep has to do this).3: Go to application manager and clear data for all Google apps.4: Factory reset the phone.After much checking on line and with the forums it seems that according to the forums about fifteen to twenty percent of the Samsung S5 and S6 phone have this problem.  The problem is fixable but, really annoying.One more thing if you have a vehicle with bluetooth make sure to check that your vehicle supports your new phone model.Over all the phone works great and does what it was designed to do.  I'm not sure if I would purchase another Samsung phone or not and only time will tell if it woks great in the long haul or if I go back to Motorola.","February 18, 2016"
4275,Samsung Galaxy S6,Amazon Customer,1,"To start off the phone looks nice though it is a little slick. I've never really used cases on phones before but I will buy one for this phone.It gets 3 stars for a few reasons.The bloatware.... Just starting it up I was prompted over and over again for this samsung app and that. Really manufacturers need to calm down on their own skins and programs. I know Android had an ugly history but now it looks great. Where Android is the ugly ducking that grew into a swan. Touchwiz has seen better days. The colors scheme is such a far cry from where stock Android is going. The themes not any better. In fact I don't know who has worse themes. Touchwiz or Swiftkey. Do yourself a favor and download Nova launcher if you're used to a stock android look. Though you still can't get rid of the horrible looking notification pull down. Seriously who thought seafoam was a good idea.The keyboard is horrible. It is the worst keyboard imaginable. Trying to get through all of these Samsung screens an activating my phone was a huge pain with this keyboard. I wanted to chuck my new phone across the room. I had to get into the play store stop it from updating and download the Google Keyboard just so I could finish activating it. Luckily I was at home with wifi. Yes I am taking a star away even though I can download a new keyboard. Had they left the google keyboard in the phone it would've been fine, but no we gotta take the keyboard away to make room for some apps and games I will never ever use.Samsung you make great phones but horrible software. Leave that to Google and stop skinning their OS and coming up with your own keyboard. This is a 5 star phone if you leave it alone after the hardware.I'll comeback and update this after a few months.1 Week updateI am returning the phone. It is an upgrade over my Nexus 5 in 3 ways.1. It's prettier, but you need a case so who cares2. Its camera is amazing3. The screen has a higher resolution than my TVThose 3 things cannot save this phone though. The battery....Haha hope you're always near a charger. I had to charge it 3 times in one day. All I use my phones for is GPS phone calls web browsing and music. I don't play games on my phone. I really do nothing processor intensive. What finally made me return this was the heat. While browsing the web it would heat up. While sitting on the bed untouched for over 3 hours it would heat up.Maybe I got a defective unit, but if reading the comments about the battery life are any indication I am not in the minority.","May 2, 2015"
4276,Samsung Galaxy S6,RAJ,5,"Have owned an S3, S4, Note 4, and now S6.  Samsung makes an excellent product. The S6 was for my son who is at college studying to be an engineer.  He LOVES this phone.  The phone is fast, sleek, logical, intuitive and highly functional.  We are amazed at each successive generation for the improvements and innovation that bring the Samsung product along.  One benefit not often though of is that Samsung seems to develop and support software updates more frequently.  They roll out the updates to many other older generations of their lines too which means your phone stays much more functional and safe for the time you own it.  Some brands do not seem to roll out updates as Samsung does-it is not that there are issues but that they constantly innovate.  This fact along is reason enough to purchase a S6 but paired with the excellent aesthetics and quality build-you can't go wrong.**Please note-I do not recommend trading in your old cell phone through Amazon. The phone that this new S6 replaced was sent in it's original box, in perfect working order with excellent battery & original equipment cables having been protected by cases & screen protectors throughout it's 2 yrs of usage. It very clearly met the criteria listed for being in the top tier yet it was downgraded to a lower value. After it a long shipping voyage there, now they shipped it back (not yet received!) taking many weeks!  Amazon evidently uses vendors to evaluate trade ins-had I know it was a third party then I would never have bothered!  This is a money making venture but not for you the consumer. Don't make the mistake of factoring in a trade in for your purchase of a new phone.  If you do decide to flip the coin and try it-take photos of the phone, photos of serial numbers and photos of every single thing.  I do not recommend that you use Amazon trade in for your old phone.  This one was in perfect condition and only 2 years old top quality-premium phone still sold today!  Better to keep it as a spare of donate it & write it off your taxes.  Very frustrated and extremely dis-satisfied by the trade in experience-especially as it was through Amazon.  I honestly expect more and this will influence whether I purchase another phone through Amazon or if I go to my carrier who had an offer of $100 for trade in value on this phone. Lesson learned-it pays to shop around and factor in your trade in value with the purchase but I choose to be loyal to Amazon rather than my carrier.Some things we don't like are NO SD card!  Though you can readily use cloud services of many kinds to safeguard your info, many of us still prefer to have that SD card.  I also am not a huge fan of not being able to remove the battery myself.  This model moves towards the Apple method of doing things where any little thing you want done has to be done at a store, shipped in or can't be done!Screen:The Gorilla glass is excellent and top quality. The clarity and resolution of the screen is outstanding-just when I thought my Note 4 was the greatest, they go and improve within the few months between the time that it came out and the new S6.Conclusion:I highly recommend this phone.  We have two tablets, and have had five Samsung phones and been very happy with them all.  They work well together and the quality is outstanding.","April 16, 2015"
4277,Samsung Galaxy S6,Mattressburn,3,"Initiallunch, I was going to give this a 1-star review because i ordered the 128gb version but received a 32gb phone!  Very, very frustrating. However, Amazon chat rep was very helpful. Although, I only found the chat option by accident as I searched and searched the Amazon site looking for a way to contact them because I has a time constraint due to planned overseas travel in less than 2 weeks. The condition of the phone I ordered was reportedly Used-Like new. The phone I received was indeed as advertised except for the critical aspect of being 1/4 the memory I'd paid for. As the chat rep and I exploited options, it became apparent no like-condition 128gb device waa available. I was resigned to simply returning the phone and looking for other options for my trip when the chat rep offered an equitable refund for the difference in value between the phone I received ad the one I'd paid for. With my time constraint, I needed Amazon to act more quickly than their policy guidelines allow them to respond. After a few conversations with customer service, explaining the situation multiple times, they came through with the refund in just a couple of days. Therefore, I added 2 stars to this review. I wanted Amazon and the seller to understand their order fulfillment processes have a serious flaw as neither company ensured the correct item was being provided.As for the phone itself. It arrived with a dead, dead battery. I researched the problem online and found a recommendation to leave out on a charger for 15 minutes. I did so and found that the screen responded after 10 minutes. Then the phone charged to 100% within 1 hour 50 minutes using my wife's fast charger. The charger that came with the phone is almost useless - a generic, 1amp charger not normally used with Samsung phones.  I use these of nothing else is available. After all this, I took the phone to Verizon and got it activated in just a few minutes. That was a week ago, and it has gone through 3 system updates in that time. Except for the lack of memory I was so looking forward to, the phone is great. Like new physically and all the software and apps are working as expected.","November 15, 2017"
4278,Samsung Galaxy S6,Technocat,5,"Decided to upgrade from my Galaxy S4 after 2 years and I am so glad that I did. This thing is so smooth and powerful that its hard to believe phone internals and tech have come along this far even in two years.I was a little upset that they got rid of the removable battery and the expandable memory, but then kind of thought about how little i really accessed those two thing on my S4.Say goodbye to the plastic casing. Not that this really bothered me because I always put my phones in a case, but the finish on this thing is incredible.Previously I didn't think much about wireless charging. Now... LOVE IT. Being able to just plunk this thing down on a pad and walk away is great. I have yet to have an issue with it connecting on first placement onto the CHOE Stadium Qi Wireless Charger. Even with a Spigen Neo Hybrid case wrapped around it.Camera... So smooth and quick on boot up. Double click the home button even with the phone is idle and BAM the camera is up and running and ready to shoot. Just remember to remove the little protective cover around the lens that they place there for shipping.The screen is beautiful and colors are very vivid. Brightness can range from almost nonexistent to nice and visible in the noon sun.One tip I will share is go ahead and sign up for the advanced calling (aka HD Voice) with Verizon. With out doing that you will not have data and calling at the same time. From what I have read it has to do with they removed an antenna in the phone to either slim the phone down or to free up space for other things, and that everyone is moving to the new Voice over LTE system anyway. No extra cost. Google ""advanced calling 1.0"" and you can get the details.","April 22, 2015"
4279,Samsung Galaxy S6,RPI Engineer,5,"I've had this phone a couple months now and it works great. I upgraded from a Galaxy S2, which used to get overheated sometimes when charging or even just when using it a lot. The S6 has never yet overheated and it's obviously much faster than my old phone.The fingerprint reader works really well. There are some times when it doesn't read my thumbprint at first try, but I just re-place my thumb and it usually works after that. It seems to be as accurate as the fingerprint reader on my wife's iphone 6 plus.I also bought the Samsung wireless charging pad and I can charge the phone even with the Spigen TPU case on it. I do have to make sure the phone is centered on the charging pad, but I'd rather deal with that than wear out the micro USB port like on my old phone. The downside of the wireless charging is that sometimes the charging stops after reaching 100% during the night. So I'll wake up to my phone having dropped down to 94% or so. Sometimes the charger does seem to keep it at 100%, but I'm not sure why it doesn't do that all the time.Speaking of charging, the battery life on this phone is great. Even if I start the morning at like 94%, I can spend time surfing the web in the morning before work or listening to the radio over the phone (using bluetooth speaker). Then I'll use the phone occasionally during the day and I almost never have to worry about topping up the battery during the day. On my old phone (even with a new battery) I always had to top off the battery during the day. With the S6, the battery is plenty for most days of typical use for me. I can even go for a long bike ride using Strava and will have plenty of battery life left when I get home.Finally, I bought this phone at a nice discount using Amazon Warehouse Deals. It was listed as ""like new"" and it really was. I couldn't find any blemishes or defects on the phone at all.","October 26, 2015"
4280,Samsung Galaxy S6,BrnFrnld,4,"First let me say I love this phone.  I have to admit though, for the first month or so...  I wondered what I'd gotten myself into, as I wound up totally obsessed with how much battery life was left, because it went so fast.  I purchased an ""Anker 2nd Gen Astro E5 16000mAh Portable Charger External Battery Power Bank with PowerIQ Technology 2-Port 3A "" to help, so I could at least leave home and not worry quite as much that I'd wind up with a dead phone running errands.  Even so, I still continued to find my focus on my dwindling battery life.  I am not one of those people who previously had a Samsung Galaxy anything, so it was not due to being disappointed with the non-removable battery like some previous customers have been.  I previously had several iPhone versions before making the switch this spring and never had an issue with battery life.  I finally solved the problem by setting my phone to the first Power Saving Mode.  I'm disappointed it was necessary to do so, and I hope in two years when I may be ready to pick up a new phone again that Samsung will have FIXED this flaw in their phone, so you can use it for at least a day or so before needing to tether it to something.  For now, using the Power Saving Mode has made it last a day or so and I'm no longer frantically keeping track of the battery power (in large part because I do have that back up Anker 'brick' I can use if it runs low or out)It does take amazing pictures, the screen clarity is also amazing and I love it.  It's slim and light enough that with the Spigen Air Cushion crystal clear case it still fits in my pocket easily.I've read a lot of complaints about the still existent bloatware and that some things that don't come with the phone from Samsun and that you elect to download also can't be gotten rid of once downloaded, which is a detractor as well.  I've been afraid to add anything by Samsung for fear I wouldn't be able to delete it, only 'disable' it.  I have a 64 g, but had intended to get 128g but none were available in gold, so I settled for the 64.I also have a complaint about these companies like Samsung and Apple who have all this hype over new products coming out and lead you to believe you'll be able to get what they advertise.  This is not the case.  I waited till the end of April and was told the sapphire case which is what I fell in love with would not be available in the US, though it's available in many other places.  And that perhaps it might be available around the HOLIDAYS.  Right... so I was supposed to either wait till the end of the year or I guess they think I'll buy another one then.  Not likely.  Just a very dissatisfied Samsung Sales Tactics customer now.  That pretty much felt like a big feck you to me, from the Samsung Corp.So... sure I'd recommend this phone, it's very nice.  But, I may not buy another... will have to see how Samsung does in the future.  I don't enjoy being made to feel the fool.","June 26, 2015"

Best display on a smartphone to date, best camera on a smartphone, beefy tech specs, attractive design, etc. All of this should warrant a 5 star review right? Wrong. The battery life on this phone is absolutely terrible. I have done my research and went out of my way to remove bloatware, adjust phone settings to conserve power, every little trick I could find online and still the battery life is not good enough for me to say ""it is a reliable phone"".The sad thing is that I don't think it is Samsung's fault. I think it has more to do with the wireless carrier (in my case Verizon, but I hear same issues exist with AT&T). Basically, I will charge my phone up to 100% (fast charge is great and works as advertised), then I just watch my battery drain even when my phone is inactive laying on my desk top. When I look at the battery statistics, something called ""call standby"" drains the phone battery even when I am not using it. In fact, it is by far the biggest battery drain on the phone even over a 4k super amoled display with full brightness. What the heck is going on Verizon?I looked into it further and saw many other people having the same issue. I noticed that my phone is always sending and receiving information to the Verizon network even when I am not using the phone. What is being sent? Does this have something to do with the NSA? Seriously. Last night I charged my phone to 100% just before bed, I cleared all apps loaded on the RAM just to see how what the battery percentage would be like in the morning and just sitting there on my night stand my phone drained 43% of the battery.Honestly, if this issue is not fixed, I am going to reactivate my old galaxy s5. I never had this issue on my s5. Hope this issue gets resolved soon or Verizon and Samsung just lost a long time customer.","April 30, 2015"
4282,Samsung Galaxy S6,JD91,5,"I'm own a Galaxy S5 and I too was skeptical when the Galaxy S6 was announced due to the sealed in battery and non expandable memory. Then I realized that while I owned the Galaxy S5 for a full year, I never even once replaced its battery. I also realized that I was only using 30 GB out of the 64 GB micro SD card I have had on my S5 for a year. Those two facts made the non replaceable battery and non expandable memory non issues for me.Now let's talk about the Galaxy S6.I was never bothered by the use of plastic on the previous models, but the new design lines are beautiful. The phone is a work of art. It feels lighter and thinner than the S5. The screen is the most beautiful on a smartphone. The new fingerprint sensor is a lot better and makes unlocking your phone much much faster and accurate. The speaker is louder than the GS5 and I like the fact that it's placed on the bottom right. I also like how the power button is now lower on the right side and that the volume rockers are two separate buttons. I haven't taken that many pictures with the rear camera, but it's a lot snappier and pictures are better than on the GS5. I love how much faster the camera starts and love that I can double tap the home button to launch the camera. . The front facing camera is amazing. No more bad selfies. I also like the fact that you can take a picture by touching the heart rate sensor. The whole phone is a lot faster and data transfer rates are also faster. Touchwiz is lighter and cleaner and Lollipop is a beautiful, fluid OS. Another great feature is fast charging. I was able to go from 0 to 100% battery in just a little over an hour. Who needs removable battery when you can recharge that quickly? The screen is so sharp, WOW!Anyway, this phone is a beast. I highly recommend it.","April 14, 2015"
4283,Samsung Galaxy S6,Mattressburn,4,"I'm reviewing a used product, for one, and two, will also be reviewing the ""upgrade"" from an S3 to an S6. Firstly, the condition of this phone was definitely better than expected. Sometimes ""very good"" to one, may not be so ""very good"" to another, but in this instance, it was definitely in barely used condition. Also, quick shipping, as well. Just because someone has Prime, doesn't necessarily mean you'll get your order delivered in the time you hope, like 2 days... I digress.Moving on to the model... why, oh why did Samsung mess with a good thing? I LOVED the Galaxy S3. Granted, moving up to that from my old HTC Incredible was a little daunting, but once I got used to it I loved everything about it. Over time, unfortunately, it got slower and slower. Hanging texts, forever to download anything, etc. I don't hate the S6, but I dislike how they removed the SD slot. Why? Not just that, the way to compose a text (adding recipients) is annoying, in my opinion. Definitely not very intuitive. To this day, using the HTC was a breeze in comparison to either of these models - you're likely better off with an app. The side scrolling... much preferred in S3, than S6, but that is me. I know everyone is different.Those are my gripes, essentially. Aside from that, it's definitely quicker, I love the feature of lightning charging, opening and cruising through apps is a breeze, transferring apps from the S3 to the S6 was a breeze. Maybe I need more time to get used to it...","May 31, 2017"
4284,Samsung Galaxy S6,BearCub,2,"update* I bought this phone a little over a year ago. The back of the phone broke a few months after I bought it. That wasn't too big of a deal since I had a cheap case on it and figured one of my dogs hit it when jumping up on me, but it was a bit frustrating since the back can't be removed and replaced. Then within the past few months I've been having non stop issues. First the speaker quit working, then the port to the ear phones, and now it's shutting off multiple times a day saying there's no charge with limited use. It's a little ridiculous that a product this expensive can't even last a year without needing to be replaced.I'm so happy to have a Samsung again. I bought the LG V10 because it was one of the few phones that had a removable battery and SD card, but had multiple issues with it.  My LG died on Thanksgiving and since my cell is my home phone, computer, e-reader and alarm clock I knew I was going to have to replace it quickly but didn't really have an extra $800 lying around to buy a new one from my carrier. I've had the Samsung Galaxy S6 for a few days now.  I chose the new option even though I had to pay more since the one and only time I bought refurbished the phone had some kind of software issue within 6 months and couldn't be fixed. It came in the original packaging with the original charger. It had about 50% battery life when I turned it on. I made sure to buy the one for my carrier so I was able to pop in my sim card and go. It was easy to set up though I did have some trouble with the my email syncing. I don't like that you have to have a ""special key"" (basically a thin metal stick) to open the drawer for the sim card, but that's just because I know I'm going to lose it.  I haven't taken many pictures, but the quality seems good. The battery life is great if you're not using the phone. It burns through the battery pretty quickly if you're on it for an extended period of time. It's a little surprising since this is smaller than my last two galaxies but seems to go through the battery faster.  I haven't played a game on it yet, but I think it'll have a problem playing games for long periods of time. It got a little over heated when I was charging it and trying to do all the initial set up at the same time. It charges quickly though.  I have had to update it two days in a row, but I think that may just be because it's an older model. It shipped fast and showed up a day early. Overall very happy with the phone.","November 29, 2017"
4285,Samsung Galaxy S6,Vader D,4,"Good phone, be warned though if you by any phone newer then 2 years 1 month.  Most are still under contract, with the original owners.  Why and how simple ANY phone new then 2 years old is probably a phone some one dropped and had a cracked screen, mic or speaker stopped working, screen started acting funny, or any number of typical random problems.  Then the original owner of the phone calls AT&T, Sprint, Verizon, ect, and says ""Hay my phone broke can I have a new one.""  Service provider says sure and takes the phone then take the broken phone along with many others, and either fixes them or sells them to someone to fix, then either the provider or the phone repair company sells them to a re-seller.  So if you go trying to get the phone unlocked like I did, you will find that technically your phone is still property of the provider and you will have to ether go with them or go with a bring your own phone plan like Tracfone, or some other company.  But ether way you will not be able to unlock the phone as long as it is still listed under the original owners plan.  So from the providers point of view you have a stolen phone.","April 6, 2017"
4286,Samsung Galaxy S6,NinthAtPine,4,"A very nice phone. I have had primarily android devices and this one live up to what I expect from androids.Overall a very nice phone, worked quickly when adding in my Verizon carrier card. It uses the nano (smallest)  sim, so be sure to have that or you will need to get one from your carrier (usually free, but takes extra time if you don't have it).The phone works nicely with my wifi, although it does not always grab the strongest signal. I have a wifi extender in the house, and sometimes the phone will remain connected to the one with less signal strength, and I must change it manually.A few cons - but all around great phone.Pros - - Nice camera, nice pictures- good reception - quick processor- Charges quickly when plugged into the wall (a little slower when using USB)- Clean look (similar look to an iphone)Cons- Camera sometimes has issues in low light focusing- Battery seems to run out quickly (they do offer cases with charger built in) I typically will hook up to my computer during the day or plug it in when in the car to keep the charge up","October 24, 2016"
4287,Samsung Galaxy S6,Ahzanti,3,"This is my first refurbished unit with mixed results. First the good news: the unit frankly looked new and it was in excellent shape. Not sure I like the glossy slickness of the S6 as it wants to slide all the time. (I have just ordered a thin Body Glove to compensate). This unit has the expanded memory I wanted as I use my phone for Kindle, music, etc. and I didn't want to run out of space or worry about it. I'm very happy about that. And, it was packaged for Verizon as promised and they were able to bring it on their network with minimal effort. So, overall that worked out fine.HOWEVER, the unit itself has its quirks. Like the touch pad stops working and won't respond to any touch on the entire screen. Given time this passes, or clicking into sleep and unclicking helps. But I do have this happen pretty regularly. And, on some calls, the other caller suddenly can't hear me anymore. I've found it works best to keep the phone in a horizontal position and not talk with it vertical (like holding against my ear the whole time). I now use my ear buds a lot to talk on all calls at least when I can plan for them. This seems to really help so I can leave the phone flat.I went ahead and kept the unit because the pro's outweigh the con's, and I can't find this 128GB new otherwise. So, mixed results, but generally in favor of the phone.","February 22, 2017"
4288,Samsung Galaxy S6,Reb Buckley,3,"There are many things to like about the S6. The screen is bright and sharp. The camera is very high quality (for a smartphone). The version I got (delivered with Verizon service) has some apps I'd call ""trash"", but nothing terrible. I got 64GB memory, and after one+ year, that seems fine for me, allowing storage of lots of pictures, and a few videos; 32GB would be cramped. Wireless charging is a blessing (and maybe a curse; see below).On the negative side, there's the battery. Battery life leaves something to be desired. If you're a heavy user, just hope that a charge lasts through a log day. Also hope that your battery doesn't flat out die, as mine did after a year and a few months (after the warranty, but before the exchange period). Changing a battery requires a professional, which means you're likely to be without your phone for a little while.Now about wireless charging...that may have been the cause, or a contributing factor, to my battery's demise. In other ways, I take very good care of my phone. It's never left in a hot car, has never gotten wet, and I've never dropped it. However, I had the habit of placing my phone on the wireless charging stand overnight. I even left it on the stand much of the day. At least with my charger, this caused the battery to warm up a bit. Some online articles indicate this can be a problem. My phone repairer is also wary of wireless charging. Obviously, I've stopped using that charger.","August 26, 2016"
4289,Samsung Galaxy S6,CarolB,4,"I love everything about this phone expect for two things: Its battery life and software. If you absolutely care about having a battery that will make it past a work day, and care about software that's smooth, responsive, and intuitive, get a Nexus 6P. In my use, I could barely squeeze 2 hours of screen time before the phone was on its last legs. That is simply not that good.There's nothing wrong with the software per se, but after a while performance starts to suffer in the form of stuttering, second delays when opening apps, and a general feeling that the phone isn't going as fast as it should. The rest of the phone is excellent. Its design is compact, easy to hold, and feels great in the hand. The screen and camera are among (if not THE) best, and even the single speaker pumps out loud audio. Also, the fingerprint reader, wireless charging, and fast charging all round out a rather complete package.However, if you care even a little about battery life and don't like the idea of searching for a charger after an 8-hour work day, and also don't like it when phone's start lagging even for just a second or two, get a Nexus 6P.","December 1, 2015"
4290,Samsung Galaxy S6,Larry,4,"This phone is a great value at around $140 to $180The screen is fantastic. Thanks to it's OLED technology the blacks are very deep and the colors are very vivid. Brightness is great for indoor and outdoor use. Stands very well next to current flagship devices.The battery life is not so grand. At 2,550 mAh. this device will need to be dropped on a charger mid-way through the day if you use your device moderately through the day.The camera quality is close to that of an entry level DSLR. With its 16mp sensor and feature packed camera app, this device's camera easily challenges most entry level DSLR. The colors are very accurate and the device has very respectable dynamic range. Low light situations are not an issue either, pictures in dark situations come out with minimal noise and decent color reproduction.The design is very premium and holds very well to today's flag ship devices.Overall it is a great device that I think most people would find great as a daily driver.","October 24, 2017"
4291,Samsung Galaxy S6,Mr Peanutbutter,3,"This is my fourth Samsung phone. This year, I experimented with AT&T prepaid, which offered me a free refurbished ZTE...the prepaid option itself has saved us hundreds of dollars, but the ZTE is absolute garbage. Slow, terrible photos, and it couldn't read my SD card. I was desperate to get back to a Samsung, but I'm on a very tight budget, so the  S9 is simply not an option. All I had to do was insert my SIM and it worked perfectly. I really missed Samsung, and I don't need all the fancy features of some of the newer models. I use my phone to track down the bus, listen to music, and keep track of emails. With Samsung, you don't need the latest and greatest to do the basics efficiently. Within half an hour of turning this on, I downloaded about 6 GB worth of music and apps, ran updates, all at the speed you can expect from Samsung. I purchased this specifically from Amazon Warehouse because they've always got great deals.Now, I completely overlooked the fact that THIS is the model that Samsung chose to forego the Micro SD card. I was really disappointed and considered returning the phone, but I'll keep it. I've gotten used to streaming music anyhow, so I'm not downloaded my entire music library onto here.","December 13, 2018"
4292,Samsung Galaxy S6,JD91,4,"Bought this phone for my wife, since we are now month-to-month with Verizon, and I saw no need to drop a pile of cash or enter monthly enslavement to their lease contract (sorry, I forgot, it's not a ""contract"" anymore).It worked out of the box with her Sim card. it's been several months, and she's very happy with it, and I'm really impressed with the pictures and general performance of the phone.It's in good condition, not immediately obvious that it was used or reconditioned.The charger supplied was obviously a cheap knock-off, but it works, and we go through chargers fairly often anyway (kids help themselves and then lose them). I think the earbuds it came with were also knock-offs, but I don't remember. Whatever they were, they weren't worth keeping.Overall, the seller did a good job with it. Well represented and the product has been pretty good.","April 4, 2017"

4294,Samsung Galaxy S6,R1,5,"I just received my White S6 128gb on Saturday & so far I have enjoy using it. I'm not totally loving the battery life because it really doesn't last very long. I had a HTC M8 before & with power saving on,  I was able to get at least 12 hrs of normal use (like surfing on social medias, texting, checking email,  YouTube). With the S6 with the same settings, if lucky,  I get 12 hrs with light use (barely using my phone except when I receive messages or phone calls).  We have a history of HTCs started to crap out on us after 2 years, so I decided trade in for the HTC, since I remember how much I loved the S3, for the S6. Plus my fiance loves his Note4, and wants me to get a Samsung. So far my pictures are way better than what I getting from my HTC, but I do miss my speakers; it is something to get use to. I really hope this phone will last me for a long time by I'm planning  to use it 2+ years, & I hope Samsung creates a bigger battery for the S6, I'll will definitely love my phone then.","October 19, 2015"
4295,Samsung Galaxy S6,Alain Osuna,4,"I honestly love this phone. I bought it used for a decent price on Amazon and have been really impressed overall. It is definitely an upgrade from my HTC One 8, as it performs much better on apps like Snapchat, Facebook, etc. and takes really beautiful pictures! (That is one of my fav. parts). I also think it looks nice and I love the large screen. The one downside I have found is that it doesn't hold battery for crap. I have to recharge at least twice per day. It also is really picky when it comes to chargers....the generic ones from gas stations literally will not work in this phone. If I can even get them to connect, it takes 6+ hours to charge. Overall I think this S6 is a good phone and definitely a more affordable option for people not able to spend a fortune on an iPhone.","May 1, 2017"

But after my baby pit bull used my Samsung Galaxy S5 for a chew toy one morning when I was in the shower, I decided on a used phone, since it was half the price of purchasing a new phone.  Imagine my surprise when I got this phone and it looked brand new!  I walked over to the Verizon store (which is 2 blocks from my office) and they immediately activated it.  And the S6 is a much better phone than the S5 I replaced.  The battery life seems longer.  I don't get the constant emails to update my phone (which I seemed to get every other day on my S5!), and I just like this phone all around much better than my S5.

Looked at the S6 Edge, but since I put my phones in an Otterbox case, it would have been a waste. After over six months, I am very happy with it.  I love just sitting in on the fast charger and having it ready to go in less than an hour. Nothing to plug-in. Waiting to see how the battery holds up, but so far, so good. It gets me though a day even with the bluetooth activity and connection to the Weather channel. I had a Droid Razr before . Also a great phone.  Lasted a long time.  I was reluctant to try another Samsung after the problems I had with an older model, but they seemed to have gotten things right.I will update if I have any problems with it.

4298,Samsung Galaxy S6,Kay Decker,5,"I upgraded from the Samsung Galaxy S4.  These are the things I like better about the S6:  Brighter display.  Two part volume button makes it easier to adjust the volume.  Being able to close apps by touching the icon to the left of the home button instead of having to hold down the home button.  Using the flashlight on the quick settings panel rather than needing a separate app. Being able to scroll down the settings panel rather than having to choose from the different types of settings in advance. Even though the screen is slightly bigger the overall size of the phone feels smaller..  I use an Otter Box Defender Series case, as I did with the S4, and it definitely is less bulky than before. I have an armband for the phone. I can put the entire case in the armband with the S6 whereas with the S4 I needed to remove the outer layer of the case. The included fast charger is definitely  faster than the S4 charger.","September 14, 2015"
4299,Samsung Galaxy S6,the professor,3,"Ok, so originally I was not going to get a Samsung Galaxy S6....however, I needed a specific type of case, and my original phone choice did not have many choices.Pros: As before, the Galaxy lines of phones are good. I have had the S2 / S4 in the past. The touchwiz overlay for Android is not too bad. The KidZone feature is kind of nice to make sure your kids don't destroy your phone. The S6 is just about the same size of the S4, so if you don't want a phone as large as your head, this is good. The phone does look nice.......Cons: Which means you cannot add a microSD card. This is my biggest gripe on the S6 (which the S7 corrects when it falls Q2'16). If this phone support the microSD card I would have gotten 2 of them. No access to the battery does not affect me at all.If you can wait for sometime, you might want to wait for the S7 to come out to get the microSD slot option to be added back.","December 17, 2015"

After about 45 minutes the technician found out the sim card in the phone didn't match the sim card label on the exterior of the box.  He replaced the sim card with a new one and everything worked fine after that.  This is the reason for the four star review instead of five.

It was out of date and needed to go. This Galaxy was a great buy for him. You cannot tell it is used. There are no imperfections on the phone or with the phone’s performance.

I tried a Dylan new version and Vorager Pro HD and returned them both only to find VXI BT350 and VXI Reveal to work satisfactory. The blue-tooth is the only issue that I have found so far. Battery life is sufficient and we love the wireless charging. Phones do get a bit warm but nothing that I think is worrisome, very little lag time with these..

Camera is good, better than my last phone, but not amazing.And I dearly miss a lot of the features of my Moto X, including graphics which felt more personalized.  Maybe I just haven't figured it out, but at this point I am missing the ability to get notifications read to me, and the Do Not Disturb feature (to turn off calls etc at night) is less intuitive and less versatile.It's actually kind of ugly on the home screen when I pull down notifictions, like recent emails.  The settings pull down too and just aren't pretty in the way they are designed.

4306,Samsung Galaxy S6,Robert J Liszi,2,"NOT A GOOD CHOICE IF DURABILITY IS A PRIORITY!The first day I had my s6 (before the Otterbox arrived, unfortunately) the phone fell 28"" on to a LINOLEUM floor, and the rear of the case cracked. I was shocked to pick the phone up and find a nickel-sized smash zone in the lower left corner of the back of the case. I was able to seal it up with epoxy resin, and once the Otterbox was on, the damage wasn't visible anyway, so no big deal, right? UNTIL...about a week later, with the Otterbox now on, I dropped the phone into a pan with a couple of inches of cold water in it. Only the top third of the phone was ever submerged, but I dried it in rice for 24 hours anyway. The thing hasn't worked properly since. All kinds if issues with connectivity, voice-to-text, touch screen response, etc. The bottom line is, I had to replace the phone (got an s7 this time) after less than two weeks of ownership, as a result of what I consider to be very minor abuse that every phone I've ever owned previously would have easily withstood. It's a nice device in a lot of ways, I guess, but it's as fragile as an egg. I would never buy another s6, nor would I recommend it to others.","January 2, 2018"

I was not aware that was why my screen was warping initially, but now I know better. I have since replaced the battery and now it is good, but I should not have to replace the battery in a phone less than a month into owning it due to either cheap parts being used for a repair, or shoddy work.  Either way this is a healthy reminder of why I don't trust refurbished goods.","December 19, 2020"

4309,Samsung Galaxy S6,Jonas Sherry,1,"Keep in mind, if you purchase an unlocked phone from a third party that Verizon may not be able to troubleshoot the phone for you. The phone I received ended up being a defective product. Callers could not hear me or I sounded very far away. I took it to the Verizon store before contacting customer support and the rep checked a few things and determined that it was a defective product. This retailer was useless for troubleshooting though. Here are some actual replies I received:I'm not sure.  Have you brought it into any store and repair place to get their opinion?*end*We haven't heard of this issue from any of our other customers.We apologize for this issue.==Did this solve your problem?*end*My answer was NO, in which case I was directed to Amazon customer service, who is not affiliated with third party retailers. I did speak to an Amazon rep who did her best and may have even contacted the retailer because she read their correspondence to me and observed that they were not attempting to be helpful.After some research I found that this was a common problem ppl were reporting with the Galaxy 6. I must have received an earlier factory release. Funny that they've never heard of it. I since purchased an official Verizon Motorola that I am very happy with, and tech support was able to troubleshoot a sim card error that started happening.I will never purchase a phone from a third party retailer again. I think I could have gotten better customer service from a rock.","January 12, 2017"
4310,Samsung Galaxy S6,Alexa,5,"Ordered this phone in used like new condition and have been very happy with both the appearance and performance.Was unlocked so a simple change of the sim card, entering of personal info and updates to the software was all it took to operate. The phone itself has great sound and reception. The factory software has been glitch free so far and runs very quickly with multiple apps open at once. Battery life is also good. The camera takes quality pictures with several built in features for multi-shots, poor lighting etc. and the flash is more than adequate. I would purchase this phone again and highly recommend it.","October 1, 2019"
4311,Samsung Galaxy S6,Alexa,3,"Samsung S6 was reconditioned and performed well all around.  However, a few problems occurred continually that may be normal for Samsung, or mine was faulty (I returned it).  First, it wouldn't seem to keep the settings.  When I thought I had set the many settings that can adjusted, within a few hours or the next day, the settings seemed to have changed.  Second, although I use the phone frequently in 3G areas with only 2 bars of reception, text messages never reached me.  People asked if I received their texts, I said no, and they showed me on their phone that the text had been sent to my phone.  Bottom line, the S6 was unreliable.  I never had experience like that with an iPhone, so I'm returning to an iPhone","December 2, 2017"
4312,Samsung Galaxy S6,JD91,5,"Best phone ever! I have lots of friends with iPhones and I find the phone quality, voice and display extremely better than even the newest iPhone. I have a few friends that also  have this phone and they refuse to upgrade. Bought this unlocked and us it with a Verizon pre pay. Love the faster charging. I get lots of compliments of photos due to the awesome camera.Only con? Had to turn off the HD voice because when I was near WiFi it would try to connect through that - even when I was driving around. While trying to connect it would drop calls. I can always turn it on if I wanted to Skype but I don't use that app.","September 11, 2017"
4313,Samsung Galaxy S6,Mattressburn,3,"It took a while to active this phone but it was my fault. Anyways, the first week was amazing, it was perfect and worked really really well. Today, I was using it as usual and when I clicked the home button to turn the screen on to look at the time, it stayed black. I pressed the side button and it didn't turn on. It was really weird. I tried charging it though it was already fully charged and nothing. No response, no sense of life, nothing. I can't get it to turn on. Idk what happened, I was using it normally one second and then the next this blackout happened. I've never had problems with it before this random nonsense happened. I'm pretty bummed out because this phone was a good $330 and now there's nothing I can do.","April 28, 2016"
4314,Samsung Galaxy S6,deanna,3,"My S4 was my favorite phone of all time.  When my contract was up, the S6 just came out, so how could I pass on what could only be 2x better than my S4.  I was pretty disappointed.  Sure, it has more fancy gadgets, and it is quicker.  But it also comes with so much less, the number one issue being battery life.  I have never made it through a full day on one charge.  And I am not talking about watching youtube all day, it could be just sitting on my desk, and if I haven't plugged it in, it will be dead by 7:00.  As much as we depend on our phones these days, this is really unacceptable.  Hopefully the S8 will be 4x better than my S4.","July 8, 2016"
4315,Samsung Galaxy S6,Kimberly,5,"Great phone for a great price, this phone was almost in a new like state when I bought it from Amazon.  I love the Samsung Galaxy S6, I have had the S3 for years now and just upgraded and let me tell you it is like night and day.  Great phone, quick at opening emails & such, the screen can be seen out side in the sun light.  This phone is like taking a small computer around with you all the time.  I do wish the sound was louder, even with the ring tone set at high level I still don't hear it all the time unless I am close by. I would for sure buy this product again!!!","August 4, 2016"
4316,Samsung Galaxy S6,AzRockDad,3,"Got my new samsung Galaxy S6 today, it's OK. Front Camera takes AMAZINGLY CLEAR selfies, not a fan of the keyboard being set up similar to an iPhone on a Galaxy phone. It's a lot smaller than my Note 4 which I have to get use to again, bout the same size as the S5 but I believe it is thinner, glad the rear camera is 16MP still. The S6 also takes wide Selfies like my Note 4 which can be good, oh and the S6 has no removable battery and doesn't take a Micro SD card like an iPhone too, battery life on the S6 SUCKS which is a known issue that both AT&T and Verizon have told me. Do some serious consideration before buying or purchase a ""Mophie Juice pack"" Battery charger for this phone,","May 9, 2015"

4319,Samsung Galaxy S6,Paid Advestisement,4,"Great phone but one month into owning and using it, the Text-to-Speech app suddenly started by itself, talking through the whole tour, and eventually locking me out completely. After chatting with a Verizon rep online to have the problem fixed, I had to do a factory reset. However, the problem returned once I restarted the phone. I had to bring it to a Verizon store to have someone actually work on it to disable the app and return the phone to its original condition. This is something Samsung needs to tweak.","October 31, 2015"
4320,Samsung Galaxy S6,Rosalia Collado,3,The phone is a galaxy S6 and the price was good. The complaint is that the battery does not hold a charge. I constantly have to charge the phone. I dont know if its refurbished because the phone is listed as new but behaves as if its refurbished. I start my day at 5:30 am and the phone is at 15% charge by 7:30 am with minimal use. I gave 3 stars on picture quality because of the battery. I cant use the phone therefore I cant use the picture. I am already looking to replace this phone and havent had it very long.,"November 6, 2018"
4321,Samsung Galaxy S6,Rosalia Collado,3,I waited 3 month to write this. My biggest concern was the lack of expandable memory. I got the 64gig version and it is more than ample. The speed is great. The only malfunction is the Recents key doesn't work. Seems to try hard at opening my recents but they don't stay open until my 4th or 5th attempt.My only real knock I have is the battery. Horrendous from the start. I'm a fairly heavy user and even with power saving mode on it gets me 8 hours maximum. As an early riser that shuts me down by early afternoon.I love the look and feel along with the prestige of carrying the premium phone but looking forward to my next phone.

Extremely easy to reply to txt msgs without opening the messaging app.  Using TING cell phone service. The fingerprint scanner takes no time to access the phone & secure.

When I got this phone for $550, the same phone refurbished from verizon was $530 and it was only 32GB.  The 128GB of storage is a welcome increase from the 16GB I had on my S4.

It kept rebooting itself.Amazon customer service arranged for an immediate overnight replacement along with a return authorization shipment document for UPS for the defective phone.Upon receiving & setting up the new phone, it has worked beautifully!  This was an upgrade from a Samsung S4 which didn't have sufficient RAM for my wife's use.  We have been very satisfied with our Samsung phones, a TV, and a sound bar.  By the way, all of them interconnect via Bluetooth.In addition, Verizon customer service was very supportive dealing with moving back and forth between the two phones until the situation was resolved.","November 12, 2015"
4327,Samsung Galaxy S6,Amazon Customer,2,"Update *** 7/6/17Have had this phone since February. Battery life is terrible. I go to work at 6  in the morning. By 8 it's less than 50% battery life. That's with just basic texting, and occasional web surfing. I purchased a new battery months ago and had it put in because I thought the original battery was bad.  Nope! Battery life just sucks. I bought a powerbear battery case that helps. But it's so bulky. DO NOT BUY A S6. I've had every version of the galaxy S series. This is by far the worst battery life.I got this phone in 2 days, super fast shipping. Phone physically is flawless, smooth working, but the batter i think is going out. I charged the phone to 100% and then started texting and normal Facebook scrolling and light things. Within 5 minutes the battery was down  to under 80% . so a 20% drop in battery drainage in 5 minutes is extremely terrible. And what sucks worse is that the battery is built in.","February 24, 2017"

If you're familiar with the older galaxies and enjoyed them then you will like this phone. I got my phone in two days as stated and it was brand new in the box. One thing worth noting that I didn't realize when making the upgrade was that this phone uses a Nano SIM card so I had to order a new SIM card. So be aware what you have so you don't repeat my mistake. That's my fault. I am happy with my purchase.,"February 7, 2018"

4332,Samsung Galaxy S6,JD91,4,"Love my new Galaxy S6!  My last phone was a Galaxy S4 and this is a noticeable upgrade.  I don't think the upgrade to the S5 would have been worth it.  My two gripes with this new phone is that it was a bad decision to change the design so you cannot replace the battery yourself or expand the memory.  With the S4 I could do that, and in fact I needed to do so.  Why the step back, Samsung?!","September 10, 2015"
4333,Samsung Galaxy S6,Mattressburn,2,"My husband and I ordered this phone, one for each of us.  It didn't say anything about being refurbished and it had a button to select buy new.  So we decided to go with it.  We get our phones and my husband's battery starts to constantly loose charge at different levels and different times.  He decided to replace the battery, which wasn't an easy task, and the battery in the phone has a sticker on it saying refurbished.  My phone doesn't download the system update and I am going to have to go to a store and see if they can get it work.  The first clie that something was wrong was when the Verizon store said that the serial numbers for both phones showed them as black, but they were listed (and arrived as) white.  We both feel that we were lied to and were deceived.","October 21, 2018"

I had a Galaxy III so this is a real upgrade for me but similar enough the learning curve isn't too severe.  Larger screen; brilliant display.  I am dazzled.  Better yet was the the seller.  I would buy from them again.  This was quite reasonably priced.  IT's refurbished but looks new.  And there was a problem initially with the order (My fault; not theirs) nonetheless, they were most accommodating  in fixing the issue.  Terrific communication with a real human.

4337,Samsung Galaxy S6,Pookie,1,I love this phone. I have had Samsung for many years. I was really impressed with my last model the Samsung Galaxy S5 but this absolutely blows even that one away. The phone is fast and its a work horse. I could not get an Sd card so I went with the !@* GB. By the time it gets its upgrades to Marshmallow it loses 21 GB of memory leaving you with a very comfortable 107 gb of memory for your own use. It has a sleek comfortable feel in your hand. I have big fingers and can type very comfortably on this phone with out the aid of a stylus. The graphics are wonderful and the hd quality is the very best. I a very happy with this purchase. You do not have to be tech savvy to use this phone. I would recommend it to any one and my wife is also going to upgrade to this model. update  4/23/17 my return window closed on march 25 and now the phone is over heating to the point it feels as though it may explode so a nice phone rendered useless and not worth my time or money!!!! guess I'll be getting a new phone but be advised this phone didn't make it pat 90 days!!!,"February 27, 2017"
4338,Samsung Galaxy S6,Jerome,1,"I bought this in March and by August I was having battery issues - charge disappearing faster and faster until it would completely shut off (even with 100% battery charge) if I tried to use it without it being plugged in to a charger.  Not much of a ""mobile"" phone if it only works while tethered... So, I bought a replacement battery on Amazon only to find out it's like Fort Knox just to get the phone open!  According to online, apparently you have to ""heat up phone"" then ""remove shell with a suction cup"" to get to the battery - WHAT?!? So, we did that to remove the back - turns out still can't get to the battery that way.  So, went to do same to the front, which ended up causing fatal damage to my screen.  Technicolor party now flashing from the opening attempt location and it won't open up to my home screen. GREAT.  THANKS SO MUCH.  And, like others have mentioned, even before all this happened, the phone would get really hot in my hands while using for more than 5 minutes at a time.  So, now I have 4 kids in 3 schools, a full time job and NO PHONE.  Definitely was not worth the money!","October 2, 2018"

4340,Samsung Galaxy S6,J9 aka Mom,1,"Bought this phone used to hold me over about 4 weeks until my new phone arrives. This phone has terrible input lag in general. 90% of the time you tap something on the screen, it will take a few seconds to register. When I am texting, there are times where I can type 3-4 words before it shows up on screen. Majority of the time it's at least 1 word delay. Apps will take forever to load, or not respond. I've tried upgrading and downgrading firmware  with same results. Battery life is horrible, phone sitting idle over night lost 64%. Should've taken that into consideration since this phone has a non-replaceable battery.  If you are going to buy a used phone, I personally would buy a phone with a replaceable battery, and buy a new battery along with it next time. This phone also gets very hot while doing very little. I tried closing all open apps, and have only the internet browser open, and just browsing alone, the phone can get hot enough where you dont want to hold it. That was fixed by getting a phone case, but you can still feel the warmth through it. I could live with the short life of the battery, but can't get over of how slow and terrible the OS is running.","June 5, 2017"

Didn't get to use the phone, however, i can tell you quality on these new Samsung phones is junk. My note 2 (although an older phone), much better quality than this piece of junk. I love how they makes these phones flimsier, yet more and more expensive. Some of the reviews say that the back comes off, the battery does not last etc. I really believe that. You just need to carefully look at it and you will understand quickly the quality is lacking. Once you hold it you know this is premium garbage.","October 18, 2017"

4356,Samsung Galaxy S6,4Senna,5,"I've been using the phone for three days now and I'm very impressed with the camera. I upgraded from the S4, which scrolled through the screens in a circular fashion. Oddly enough the S6, does not scroll through circular. For instance, if you have three sceens you go 1,2,3 and then you have to go back 3,2,1 in order to get back to the first screen. Whereas the S4 you could go 1,2,3,1,2,3. That's the only thing I've found disappointing so far, so pretty good overall! The speed is always top notch when you first get the phone. It slows over time, so I can't speak on that at this time.","April 25, 2015"
4357,Samsung Galaxy S6,Rebecca Bascomb,2,"Love the S6.  But this dealer sent a phone ""Like New, still in box"" that would not accept a charge.  It arrived with a 0% charge, at the end of an overnight charge with the enclosed factory charger it was still at 0% charge, and then using a charger I knew was functional for two hours, it was still at 0% charge.  This would have been so easy to catch before they sent it out.  Could have been a bad battery, could have been something way worse.  Thank you, Amazon, for making a refund the DAY I SENT IT BACK!!  Which was two days after it arrived.  I'm going to buy another ""Like New"" one to replace a worn out S6, but probably won't be buying from GreenTechCa this next time.","July 22, 2017"
4358,Samsung Galaxy S6,Amazon Customer,2,"I have bought this same phone twice before this one, I broke one and bought another for someone else. No problems with the first two until I dropped one. Not my favorite phones in the world but they served the purpose, until the third one. it overheats for no reason, doesn't stay charged at all, cuts off at about 80%, sometimes doesn't recognize the charging cable or a wireless chargers, a lot of other stuff but you get the picture. This phone is a wreck. I think the seller sold a refurbished phone but didn't disclose that. Unfortunately, I really need a phone at all times so I have to go through purchasing another phone before returning this one. A real hassle.","February 11, 2019"

I quickly emailed the seller and I received an emailed response within MINUTES, informing me that the typo was corrected and my ordered product, a beautiful Samsung S6, was on its way.Shipping was quick and I'm impressed with the quality of the phone (Absolutely NO SCRATCHES anywhere), screen and charger.Thank you Thank you Thank you!!!!!","February 22, 2017"
4360,Samsung Galaxy S6,arkansastraveller13,5,"I was hesitating to purchase this item here and not directly from a retail store or from my cell Company but I decided to give it a chance and so far everything is beyond expected: phone screen never freezes, phone calls are clear and do not cut off, speaker phone is great, it connects easily with any Bluetooth device. and the best part is that I saved hundreds of dollars with this purchase as well as getting a low monthly bill, I can trust this seller and its products.","July 31, 2017"

4362,Samsung Galaxy S6,JD91,5,"Incredible phone.  It takes better pictures than my camera.  And it's light and I love the redesign.  The ONLY con I can think of, it tends to eat up a battery.  On my S5 I could go all day and with careful use towards the evening, I could make it to bed time to charge.  But with this phone, I have to plug it in about 2pm with normal usage just to make it home to plug it in later.  I wish it had the removable battery option.  I can see a battery/case for this phone in the future.","June 4, 2015"
4363,Samsung Galaxy S6,Mattressburn,2,I have had an S6 for years. when our unit became non repairable I ordered this Rebuilt one. The price was right and it had all the features we had come to love. Except that it worked only one day. Unit kept shutting down. sometimes it would need a Hard restart to get it to come on. ( hold power button and volume Button at the same time) I worked with the Samsung tech support and they remotely went thru the phone did a factory reset and down loaded all the updates. At that point the same updates kept trying to reload every hour or so. and it kept shutting down more often. Not happy with the rebuilt Samsung. Loved my old brand new one.,"August 1, 2018"
4364,Samsung Galaxy S6,Brandon West,4,Phone arrived on time. In very good shape and has worked pretty good so far.

4365,Samsung Galaxy S6,Bob,3,"This phone is good, except for 2 things. When i plug it into the computer to drag/drop files, the folder is blank. It just shows as an empty drive and when i try to put any files on there I get an error. Also, the battery life isnt very good and unfortunately Samsung got rid of the removal back so I'll need to end up having the battery replaced probably. Hopefully i can reset the phone to fix the issue with it showing a blank drive.","August 1, 2016"

4367,Samsung Galaxy S6,Michelle M,2,"I bought this phone and it arrived 2 days ago. I went and had Verizon give me a new Sim card to put in it and presto, all was working perfectly. Until that is, I tried to charge it. The charge port on my phone works worse than my S5 that is nearly 3 years old now. I have to hold the wire at the perfect angle for it to charge. Next is the fact that with the charger they provided it takes nearly 7 hours to charge the phone. I don't have that long to wait and be tied to a charger. Finally once it is fully charged the battery won't even last the work day, only answering texts and calls.Not happy with this phone.","April 16, 2017"
4368,Samsung Galaxy S6,Jason,5,"My S4 was getting tired, the Note 7 was a disaster, and I didn't want to pay over $700 for a phone. This S6 was a great choice for half the price. It cloned easily. I was concerned about not having an SD card slot, but that hasn't been a problem thanks to 32 GB of internal memory. I didn't realize that it had built-in Qi charging, but I love that feature. My new Prius has a charging pad and I now have three other pads around the house.","January 25, 2017"

4371,Samsung Galaxy S6,candis burnham,3,"The phone came on time, and was well protected. The major problem is that the screen has a defect and displays squares and shapes faintly in the background.

I'm returning it.","April 2, 2018"

4373,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Claudia Perez,5,"From the time I first got this phone it hasn't worked right.  The ""visual voicemail"", never worked from the get go.  I can send text messages out, but can't receive any.  When I try to access the ""spam protection"" settings,I get a ""menu options not available"", message.I contacted my service provider and they said everything is fine on their end...contact Samsung.  I contact Samsung they said take it to a warranty center, which I did. The service guy checked it out and said, hardware side, everything checks out.  Must be a problem with the ""firm ware"" or the Android Software,which they can't check, they only do hardware...ie..screens, battery, etc..  So I need to contact Samsung tosee what to do next.  Well, that happened today so I still need to check with Samsung.  Probably gonnamake me send the phone back to them.  Might take anywhere from 3 to 6 weeks for repair.  Great..!What a major Pain in the A--!Sucks to spend 1000 bucks to get a phone that does not work out of the box.  3 months of misery.Footnote....found out the problem was with the carrier after all the denial.

4374,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Crystal D Whitaker,1,"Both my husband and I received our phones at the end of December. It was great at first, good battery life, great features, everything seemed to work.1st Phone's death: While open, the phone accidentally touched a sharp tool (very lightly) and immediately the screen started bleeding. does no charge and became useless.2nd phone's death: At 5 months, the outer screen protector started peeling off at the center point of the lid. every day it peeled off a little more. I was just about to request the replacement for next week BUT today I find a small black dot in the screen close to the center corner that then began to bleed towards the center and upwards. I guess a dust particle got in and that was it.Screen repair is almost $500 each so NO!RIP to both flip Z4. almost $2K lost. so disappointed","June 1, 2023"
4375,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Uncle Charlie,5,I got the phone to be a major upgrade for my wife who had a Motorola prior and man she loves this phone it reminded her of her purple Razor flip phone she had way by back in the day. The touch screen is fantastic the little screen in the front you can read your messages respond back with preset message you can edit them to say what you want. The build quality is amazing and sturdy you don't feel like it's gonna break every time you flip it open and close its sold. It takes really good pictures and she loves taking pictures. The battery life is pretty good she puts about 5 hours of screen time a day and by the end of it she is around 50%. I would recommend this phone to anyone who liked the moto razor or anyone looking for the wow factor. Everyone always ask to see it and flip it ha.,"January 7, 2023"
4376,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Claudia Perez,4,"I love Samsung phones, the phone was factory unlocked and worked great from the get go. but this month I dropped the phone from my bed to the floor and from there on the phone started having problems. It didn't open fully but still worked, so , yesterday I open the phone to check my emails and I heard smth  like swish sound coming from the phone it sparked a white line and the screen went black, this phone didn't lasted a year I cannot believe it, I thought this was a good sturdy phone but no. I still have two more payments to go and it doesn't work. I had to get a new phone in the meantime. I am not sure if I will replace the screen, because the replacement screen is not cheap either. Will I get another flip in the future, I don't think so.","August 16, 2024"

4379,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,MinahLee389,1,"I purchased this phone 10 months ago for my wife.  She handled the phone diligently and only opened it when she needed full screen( she has the galaxy watch paired with it) and the screen still cracked at the fold.No problem I thought, I have this covered under my cellular provider insurance.  Welp not quite.  AT&T will not replace the device as long as its within the one year of the manufacturers warranty. For weeks I got the run around as I was redirected from AT&T to Bestbuy from them to a smaller authorized repair shop.  The repair shop said it's a 50/50 chance that Samsung will pay them to replace it.  They gave me some US representative number to call and send the phone back to Samsung for replacement.Still haven't heard back Samsung.  Basically I wasted money buying this POS and Samsung has made it difficult to get it repaired within the warrnty time frame.Stay away from this and any other flip phone from Samsung.  The screens are not up to the durability standards that are expected, even when handled delicately!","July 17, 2024"
4380,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Ale,3,"The phone was pretty convenient with it's extra large screen that folded smaller to fit in a pocket and mostly did everything it said on the tin.  After only 3 week, though, it got debris lodged in the hinge and no phone repair company near me would work on it as it's ""too much of a liability to work on foldables.""  Put up with it and used it for months in it's new slightly-bent state.  Eventually the screen protector needed replacing but removing the screen protector caused the bottom left 25% of the screen to go dark.  This combined with several small cracks now forming near the screen's joint is having me retire this phone after 18 months of use.  It's a shame as the phone worked well before the hardware failures took over.","March 30, 2024"
4381,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,JSAvery,3,"I waited to review this phone until I'd had it for awhile and could see how long the fold in the middle of the screen would last. The answer is 7 months. The fold has started to show rough patches. It hasn't started distorting yet but it's only a matter of time.  I really like how compact the phone is and it's a decent phone, but the screen is an issue. I'm going to wind up getting a new phone just about the time I finish paying this one off. It was not cheap and I feel that it was a a pretty bad value.","February 20, 2024"

4385,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Amazon Customer,2,"I bought this phone end of April to replace an S8+ that is just getting too old, battery needs recharging several times a day, no more updates, not 5G, etc. The good: battery life is great, reception is good everywhere I've been, almost all the apps I had on the old phone work seamlessly. The bad, really, really bad: two days ago getting up I knocked the phone off my nightstand, after which it would not open past 90%. I took it to a Samsung authorized service center. They have to remove the CPU and put it in a whole new phone at a charge of $341.00 and because this phone is known to be so fragile, they will not warranty it.I am a fan of Samsung, I have their TV, phone, ear buds, watch, washer and dryer, refrigerator, range and microwave.

I finally purchased this Flip 4 specifically because I could easily carry it in my pocket. A major selling feature was the factory installed screen protector, but sadly it began to fail within two weeks of the purchase. The bubbling screen protector makes the phone difficult to read in bright light and has begun to trap dirt.

Sure, it's a bit of a gimmick, but being able to actually fit a phone into women's pants has been great.  The folding mechanism is super fun.  I'd purchase an accidental damage warranty of your choice on this (I went with Samsung's Care+) just in case though, as it seems like it's more fragile than your standard candybar phone.

4390,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,Mike M,2,I thought buying an unlocked phone would allow me the freedom to not be locked into a specific Carrier.

Pages don't load processing is slow I called Samsung and AT&T and was told that this unlocked phone is not registered on any network. So even though I'm paying $80 a month for AT&T the phone isn't recognized by their network. I went in to check T-Mobile thinking I would switch however my friend at T-Mobile told me the same thing would happen on their network.

4420,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,SJ,1,"If I could give 0 i would, I’ve purchased 2 of these phones within the last year and both of the screens went black after a few months, and Samsung is no help, nearby repairs shops they work with do not have the parts to make the repair. The other option is to ship the phone for about a month to SEE if they will be able to repair or replace the device. Over $2000 in the trash.","March 20, 2024"
4421,SAMSUNG Galaxy Z,margarita barajas,1,"I love the concept.  And I initially loved this phone.  Unfortunately just 30 days in,  the hinge quit working. The company selling referred me to Samsung, who to their credit fixed it (entailing sending the phone to them and then having it sent back, so plan two weeks without a phone).  Fast forward 9 months, the hinge breaks again.  This time no one will help.  Samsung promises call after call someone will get back to me as they won't let me send it in again, but no one ever does.  So less than a year and it can't be used and can't be fixed.","December 22, 2023"

4472,SAMSUNG Galaxy S20,Jae,1,"The phone I ordered was Cosmic Gray, and the one I received was black. Further, the battery life on this thing is troubling. I previously had a Samsung Galaxy S10+ before I purchased this, and that phone I would safely charge every 1.5 days. I find myself having to charge this one at least twice a day, with even LESS use than the previous phone. Thirdly, the phone/battery is constantly warm, to the point where I have to put it down for fear of overheating. That's troubling because, again, I have not been using it for long periods of time. I don't use it for gaming, heavy media use, or anything of the sort.I've always been satisfied with my Samsung Galaxy S purchases, but unfortunately not this time. I can't rely on this phone. I suspect it may not even be new, despite the product description saying otherwise.

Whiz Cell responded quickly to questions and  helped verify the product. I received a brand new unopened S20+ just as described, and unlike other seller with higher prices for used and non-OEM re-flashed phones that they describe as ""factory unlocked"" which they are not.

4488,Samsung Galaxy J3,R L,4,"This is a prepaid phone, but I was able to activate it on my Verizon unlimited account by first activting in on the cheapest ""prepaid"" plan for about $30, and then having Verizon customer service migrate it onto my existing account using the phone number I already use.  It was a little complicated for them to accomplish (took about 1/2 hour on the phone), but it saved me about $100, so it was worth it.The phone itself is perfect for my needs.  It doesn't have alot of internal memory, but I just stuck a micro SD card in it and stored my contacts and various aps on it.  It doesn't come pre-loaded with lots of junk aps, which is a huge plus!The internet works fast, but the media volume leaves a bit to be desired. The phone sound clarity is good, and I get good reception in my house (which was a problem with my ancient S4, and why I bought a new phone).Interestingly, it didn't come with a voicemail ap.  I downloaded one from the PlayStore, and now I'm a happy camper in that department.I have read that the camera clarity is not good.  That may be true if you are using this as your primary camers.  For my purposes it seems to be just fine.All-in-all, if you are not a smartphone power user, this phone is perfectly adequate.  I recommend it!","February 21, 2017"

However, I will say that I don't download much and only have about 3 apps that didn't come with this phone (banking, Word, and FB Messenger). I store all my videos & photos in my Google Cloud and erase from phone's memory constantly. I still encounter issues where my phone doesn't have enough memory - like yesterday when Samsung said it had an update for my phone. I had to go to my phone's storage & erase cached data in order to get just barely enough RAM to download the update. Nothing I have on my phone can go on an SD card, so that is not the issue. The internal memory is just not enough after all the factory settings take up 85% of the phone's storage.","March 4, 2017"

4554,Samsung Galaxy J3,elizabeth r Robertson,3,"Why Samsung would use the name ""Galaxy"", which represents its flagship phone, to a low-end phone like this is beyond my comprehension.  I briefly had a used Galaxy S4 before this phone, and even though it was 3 years old, it had better features and specs than this brand new (2016) Galaxy J3.  The J3 has a mediocre processor (1.2 Ghz) and a camera that by today's standards is low resolution (5 MP).  What's worse is that for some reason, Verizon chose to only make this phone available with 8 GB of internal memory, when the same phone on carriers like Boost and Virgin Mobile comes with 16 GB.  I had the exact same specs last year on my ZTE Overture 2 phone from Cricket Wireless that only cost me $50 (and is less than that now).Other disappointments with this phone are that there is NO notification light on the front of the phone when you get new text messages or voicemails.  The only visible way you'll know that you've received a text or voicemail is by looking at the home screen (you can get the phone to beep or vibrate for notifications).  Similarly, when the phone is charging, there is no indicator light on the face to tell you when charging is complete; again, you'll have to look on the lock screen or home screen for a message that says the phone is fully charged.  When sending a text, there is no way to speak the words that you want to text rather than typing them, which can be very frustrating at times.  If you use Verizon's own messaging app on the phone, you can speak and attach an audio file of your voice to your message, but there is no voice to text functionality.On the plus side, the battery life seems decent so far.  I've used the phone for navigation with Google maps and Waze for 3 hours or more and did not need to recharge the phone.  You get the most recent version of the Android OS on this phone (Marshmallow), which is not yet available on some phones that cost much more than this one.  The best reason to choose this particular phone, though, is that it runs on the reliable Verizon network.  For $45/month (plus tax and your local 911 fee) you'll have access to unlimited nationwide calling, texts and 2 GB of data on Verizon's network.  Sign up for auto pay, and you'll get an extra 1 GB of data every month, for a total of 3 GB data monthly.","July 1, 2016"

4564,Samsung Galaxy J3,MoJones85,5,"When my 2nd Galaxy Note 7 was recalled I had 3 choices: (1) reactivate my crappy 4 year old phone, (2) pay $700+ for last year's Samsung Flagship Galaxy 7 Edge (3) get a new, inexpensive phone to hold me over until the Galaxy 8's are released.Since I am a die hard Samsung Loyalist, I went for the Galaxy J3.  It was cheap compared to the flagship phones - $175.I am pleasantly surprised; I like this little phone.Setting It UpVery simple.  I used the Samsung App called Smart Switch to clone my Note 7.  The app downloaded all my pics, ringtones, settings, contacts and apps, even most passwords.  The entire process took about 30 minutes.Pros:- Cheap- Same interface as the Galaxy 7; same apps; very similar user experience- Removable battery- Accepts an external memory chip- Small, light weight- Long lasting battery- Cases and screen protectors are cheap- Wont explode or catch on fire- J3 is so inexpensive that I skipped insurance- It can do 95% of what a Galaxy 7 can do- Did I mention cheap? You can buy 3 of these for the price of a flagshipCons:- Smaller than a flagship phone- Camera is a little bit slower- Friends not impressed (like I care)- Doesn't have the high definition screen optics of a flagship- No fingerprint scanner, no Samsung payBottom Line: Great phone; can do 95% of the things an $800 phone can do.PS: I paid full price for this phone; nobody gave me anything as an incentive to write this review.","October 19, 2016"
4565,Samsung Galaxy J3,Brenda,4,"It's a lower-end phone, so you can expect some cuts in places.  The camera leaves a lot to be desired, so Instagrammers and Snapchatters....consider.  The 8GB internal memory sucks - and makes no sense for any smartphone in existence.  I added a 32GB SD card to offset this issue, which has helped, but the problem shows up with the ""stock apps"" and non-transferable apps (like a bank app) that periodically update.  So eventually, depending on what types of apps you download, you could run out of workable internal memory space no matter how much you transfer to the SD card.  However, it has the typical Samsung perks, plus it plays my music, it switches to Bluetooth seamlessly, its LED screen is a plus; the phone is tough, the battery is solid, and the operating system is outstanding.","July 23, 2016"
4566,Samsung Galaxy J3,R L,3,it is a good phone but only problem is that it is onlly a 8GB and the phone take over half of it and i couldnt get anything APP on the phone it keep saying that it didnt have enough space and anything and everything that i could i put on SD card and it still said not enough sapace for nothing so i had NO APP ON THIS PHONE AT ALL !!!so i had to go with another phone they need to make this 16GB or higher phonesad that i had to go anothr phone because everyhing else i loved this phone,"July 5, 2017"
4567,Samsung Galaxy J3,Steve,2,"This phone is beautiful and mostly functional, but I've had an issue with using a hands free device while traveling in my car (tried 3 different ones same problem with all). There is terrible noise on the end of the listener. I took it to Verizon and they said the microphone on the phone is not shutting off when you're using the microphone on the hands free device. SO thinking it might be a lemon I went in and got another J3. Same problem. Now they are both going back. I also found the camera to be pretty crappy. Can't even get the colors right. If neither of those things are important to you, you'll probably get a long great.","August 18, 2016"
4568,Samsung Galaxy J3,kelly arlene cora,4,"I love the phone because it's fast, responsive and it does what I need it to do. I love the features it has. The two things I dislike is when my SD card is being used, like installing apps or copying music, my phone will restart, but I'm assuming it's a bad SD card. Also I'm used to auto-brightness in different lighting areas, and this phone does not have auto brightness as it don't have the sensor that allows that function. Overall great phone.","July 20, 2016"
4569,Samsung Galaxy J3,Owyhee gal,2,"I got this on a Black Friday sale elsewhere. I bumped it off the bedside table. It landed on padded carpeting and stopped working. It was nice for two months!  I had been using a flip phone, only wanted this to be able to look up stuff for price/re views when shopping. I went back to my more rugged Samsung flip phone. It was to late to return, and at $24, I had not bothered with insurance.","March 11, 2018"
4570,Samsung Galaxy J3,Leo Maneke,4,"I got this phone brand new a few months ago on sale at my local Best Buy. This phone is sleek and looks great, feels well made. It has great functionality, is snappy and comes with the latest Android software...i can say it is much faster than my old out-dated smartphone. The camera is okay, but not great as it's only 5mp so don't expect iphone quality shots. I originally used my J3 on Verizon's prepaid plan but have switched over to Straight Talk, and my data speed really hasn't changed plus I'm still on Verizon's network so I am getting the best deal, in my opinion. Overall, I love this phone, and I got a stellar deal on it! The only real problem is the lack of storage...it comes pre-installed with some bogus apps that take up most of the limited storage space. So you really must pick up an additional memory card or you'll only be able to download 3 or so additinal apps, depending on the amount of photos and/or music you have on your phone.","September 28, 2016"
4571,Samsung Galaxy J3,nearoffutt,1,"Owned this phone for over half a year now or so. Memory is always an issue just like everyone noticed. But here's a kicker. Just today it stopped charging while showing that it's ""charging"" on the battery indicator. And nothing you can do but watch as the life runs out of it. If you ever notice your phone not actually charging even though it says it is, prepare yourself. Cause now it won't even turn on. And it won't show a charging icon when it's off and plugged in.","October 22, 2016"
4572,Samsung Galaxy J3,SammiJo Skinner,5,"I have gone from an iPhone to a Samsung flip phone and now upgraded to a Samsung J3V using Verizon as my service provider.  Unlike a lot of smartphone users, I am not heavy on apps and I am not concerned about the camera.  As an amateur photographer, I already own 4 digital cameras.  I am a PC kind of of guy in a handheld world, which is fine with me.  All I wanted was a phone for calls, email and text messaging and one which will operate in Europe.  I got all that at a very reasonable price.  After adding an 8 Gb SD card, and an Otter box case, I was good to go.  If you dont need all the bells and whistles of a more expensive phone, then consider this one.","July 12, 2017"
