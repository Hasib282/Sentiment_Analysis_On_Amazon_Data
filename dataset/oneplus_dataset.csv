"OnePlus Nord N30 5G | Unlocked Dual-SIM Android Smart Phone | 6.7"" LCD Display | 8 +128GB | 5000 mAh Battery | 50W Fast Charging | 108MP Camera | Chromatic Gray",forest,5.0,"I bought this phone at the recommendation of a friend who is very happy with theirs. I'm someone who isn't picky about my technology... I just want it to be straightforward, reliable and affordable. I'd honestly just get a flip phone if it wasn't so hard to get by in today's day & age without it being the expectation now that everyone has a smart device, on them at all times.Well... this phone fits the bill and then some! First of all, the battery life is honestly baffling. I'm not joking, I drove 20 minutes with GMaps GPS running and arrived still at 100%. I was so confused, not a single percentage point? I just wanted something that didn't obnoxiously guzzle battery and got so much more! Not sure how long this level of performance will last with the limited knowledge I have on how to maintain it, but sufficed to say this is really amazing so far.As far as everything else goes, I upgrade my phone so infrequently that I really don't know how it compares to what else is out there... even if you showed me ""the specs."" I'm sure it isn't the absolute best around, but what I can tell you is this: the call clarity is great, both handheld and speaker. Bluetooth connects quickly and stays connected. I can have a lot of apps and Internet tabs open and switch between them and not be waiting for stuff to load (don't worry, I clear them when I'm done). Oh and the camera quality is so clear! Long story short, everything that needs to work works, it works well, and it's pretty easy for a less tech savvy person like myself to figure out.The price point is what initially sold me. I paid only $250 for this phone and I feel like it was an excellent value. Most other devices I've seen online average nearly twice that cost, or are a similar/lower price but poor quality. Not sure what you'd get out of the more expensive ones, but I'm more than happy with what I've got here.TL;DR: if you ""just need a phone that works,"" get this one! You won't be disappointed.","May 19, 2024"
"OnePlus Nord N30 5G | Unlocked Dual-SIM Android Smart Phone | 6.7"" LCD Display | 8 +128GB | 5000 mAh Battery | 50W Fast Charging | 108MP Camera | Chromatic Gray",Drew,5.0,"I have this phone for a few months now and for the price, this is a great phone. I was looking for something that wasn't one of the mainstream brands like Samsung, Apple, etc. I like the features (decent storage, can use external storage, large screen, comes unlocked, good battery life with quick charging, various widgets, so many settings, and more) and the lack of ""bloatware"" that comes with the phone.There are 2 things that I don't like about the phone compared to my last one (Google Pixel 3).1, that I was aware of from other reviews, is the camera is not the best. Sometime you need some really good light for the picture to come out decent, otherwise pictures can be rather dark. I find myself editing them often to brighten them up. That and it lacks the crispness that you can get with phones like the Google Pixel and others. Besides that, it has some cool camera options, like professional mode (which if I learned how to use that I'm sure my images would come out a bit brighter), macro, others, and some of the editing tools are pretty cool.And 2, something that bugs me enough to note it here, is the responsiveness of the screen. I don't think it is an app issue as it has happened with multiple apps, but sometimes while swiping in a direction, it doesn't always respond the way I want it to. For example, I use Spotify very frequently, and it's where I get annoyed at this issue the most. In Spotify, when you are viewing a song you can swipe from right to left to change a song, or swipe down to get out of the song view, taking you back to a menu screen. So many times, it does not register my swipe to the left, instead it registers it as a downswipe, exiting the screen I was on. And like I said, this happens with other apps too, where I'm trying to swipe across, but instead it registers as a downswipe exiting the screen I was on.Other than the 2 issues I have with this phone, it's honestly great for the price. I'm disappointed with the camera sometimes, but that is coming from my previous phone's camera being so crisp and bright, and I also knew about it based on the other reviews I read. And the swiping issue can be annoying, but it is tolerable.Overall decent phone.","July 26, 2024"

The display is crisp and clear -- again something I like. The speakers allow me to listen to a lecture while driving if put on my shoulder. The one thing I dislike, and it is probably a part of the OS, is that I cannot delete portions of a message thread; the only option is to delete the entire thread. Also, I am used to a quick and easy way to add contact info to an incoming text. I go round and round trying to figure out how to do this with this OS. This is definitely an improvement to my Samsung and Motorola phones. No real bloatware. The automated ""clean app"" bing from T Mobile did not work despite multiple bings. That's OK just as long as I can do it manually. This is my second Nord OnePlus phone. It won't be my last. I already have the extension tablet with keyboard -- I like that I can ""cast"" my phone to that bigger work/viewing surface -- and I have the Pro2 earbuds. For a brand that I never heard of before seeing them on Mint Mobile, I am pleasantly surprised at the usability. and innovations. Their red cable recharger even speed recharges my Samsung work phone. It's hard not to follow what they are doing...","January 2, 2024"
"OnePlus Nord N30 5G | Unlocked Dual-SIM Android Smart Phone | 6.7"" LCD Display | 8 +128GB | 5000 mAh Battery | 50W Fast Charging | 108MP Camera | Chromatic Gray",Amazon Customer,5.0,"Short version: I got this for my mom since she had a habit of buying the cheapest Samsung phones and then calling me repeatedly because they had weird issues. This fixed those issues.This phone has a somewhat mediocre camera, a solid processor, plenty of RAM for regular usage, a good screen, lots of storage, and Oxygen OS is a very nice simple android experience for a very comparatively cheap price. the chassis feels kinda cheap but you should stick it in a case anyway so who cares.The only real catch with this is that it only gets one major Android upgrade, period- vs I think the 3-4 upgrades the bigboy OnePlus models get. That's the only issue and it's a notable one depending on what kind of user you are so pay attention to it. The actual phone bits of the phone are all great.","August 10, 2024"
"OnePlus Nord N30 5G | Unlocked Dual-SIM Android Smart Phone | 6.7"" LCD Display | 8 +128GB | 5000 mAh Battery | 50W Fast Charging | 108MP Camera | Chromatic Gray",C. Jack,5.0,"I have a Samsung s22 Ultra. I've been having battery and connectivity issues, not being able to use roaming data, spotty 5G where I should have it, etc. Went from a regular SIM to an ESIM and nothing got better, so I decided to try an inexpensive backup.Got this phone based on reviews. The biggest negative I could find online about it was regarding haptic feedback, which I always turn off because haptics irritate me... so that's a non-issue. There were also a few comments about the OxygenOS, but I use Nova Launcher on all my devices so this is a non-issue.So far so good. Once I received a physical SIM from my phone company, and got it installed... I immediately had excellent connectivity on my network, around town and when traveling.The pluses are the headphone jack, microSD card slot, battery capacity, and of course the price. The package includes a VERY FAST charger, which is amazing. Also, it was very easy to mirror my Samsung to this phone via USB-C to USB-C... only had to install a few particular apps. It runs all the apps as you would expect, like Spotify having connectivity on all your devices. Bluetooth connected perfectly to my vehicle, my Yamaha guitar amp, and laptop another devices for transferring files etc.As for negatives, the camera was a big downgrade from the Samsung, it's nowhere near the quality. And it's a little slower running some apps. I expected both of these things to be the case.Honestly, phones are like guitars. If you're buying an Apple (don't) or a Samsung or a Gibson or a Fender, you're paying a big chunk of money for the name... when there are very excellent options out there that a fraction of the price.I still have my Samsung for concert videos, games, wifi etc. But after a couple of weeks of using the One Plus N30, I've come to the conclusion that if you're spending over $500 on your phone then you're kind of throwing money away.","May 27, 2024"
"OnePlus Nord N30 5G | Unlocked Dual-SIM Android Smart Phone | 6.7"" LCD Display | 8 +128GB | 5000 mAh Battery | 50W Fast Charging | 108MP Camera | Chromatic Gray",Fabricated,5.0,This is a great phone.  I had a Pixel 5a die(my fault) and thought I would upgrade to a Pixel 8 pro.  The 8 pro was more than twice the cost of this phone and glitchy.  It crashed the OS constantly so I decided to return it and get the N30 delivered the same day.  It's not the most sleek phone and the camera isn't quite the same quality as a flagship phone but I am super happy with it.  A great value and easy set up.  I wasn't sure what Oxygen OS was but it is just android.  Highly recommend for those who aren't trying to spend $1400 on a new iphone.,"August 7, 2024"
"OnePlus Nord N30 5G | Unlocked Dual-SIM Android Smart Phone | 6.7"" LCD Display | 8 +128GB | 5000 mAh Battery | 50W Fast Charging | 108MP Camera | Chromatic Gray",John,3.0,"I've been following OnePlus 's products since the beginning, just never had an opportunity to get one. It's a fantastic, smooth, and FAST experience. It's a quick phone, yet great battery life. It has massive camera lenses that poke out a little, which I'm not very keen on but they look very cool. Fingerprint scanner is on the right side which is fine, but the scanner is very sensitive. It will often unlock itself by accident just because I simply slid the correct finger over the sensor not-knowingly; not a big deal but present. The display is amazing, clear, bright, and responsive. The UI is also very customizable, it's pretty cool, The phone comes with a pre installed screen protector too. Theres this cool feature the phone has where you can also designate up to 4gb of onboard flash memory to RAM so you effectively have 12gb of RAM which is gnarly, this is the only phone I've seen that can do that.Update and revision: so my unit bent, and it did indeed have a case, a very sturdy one. The phone bent just above the finger-print reader and just before the volume rocker, and bowed it significantly. The screen didn't crack but it was visibly warped. It seems this unit may be fast but it can't handle the simplest of pressure, and I suspect there probably isn't any metal reinforcement on the chassis either; straight plastic and glass. The back panel is also prone to being scratched and scraped by literally anything that's semi hard. Sand, dust, just being slid across a table it seems. Not a big fan of paying almost 350 bucks for a phone that warps in under 8 months. I switched to a Razr flip because at least that's designed to bend.","February 28, 2024"
"OnePlus Nord N30 5G | Unlocked Dual-SIM Android Smart Phone | 6.7"" LCD Display | 8 +128GB | 5000 mAh Battery | 50W Fast Charging | 108MP Camera | Chromatic Gray",John,4.0,"I'm conflicted even writing this but here goes.... This thing is impressive for the price paid.I am a HUGE Samsung fan. I HATE Apple. I always spend the most money for the newest phone with as much memory as offered. My thought being it will last until the next time I need a phone. It will remain relevant, the tech won't be obsolete, and presumably I'm buying a quality product.That mentality has served me well... Until it didn't. My S22 Ultra is having connectivity problems. We'll it really isn't that old and I owe $700+ on it still. So I was in a tough spot, fixing it means a bill probably North of $300(maybe more) and then I would still owe the money on top of it. I didn't thi k either option was right. Paying it off seemed too expensive. Fixing it seemed silly, and ultimately too expensive.So in the short term I went and found the cheapest phone I could stomach. A Motorola something or other for $150. It had 4G of RAM which caused Microsoft Teams to not even start on my phone. It just instantly crashed. So for awhile I just used that as my Hotspot for my Samsung (which had its drawbacks for sure).That isn't working. Alright I can still return this Motorola. What else for a little more money might be better? A refurb? Nope... Still $300+ in anything I would accept. I read. I researched. I finally come to the One Plus. Lots of nice things are said about the phone and fresh of my recent ""cheap phone"" experience, let's just say I was dubious.It goes on sale for $230. Alright for $230 I'll bite.I got to tell you... For a $230 it's hard to gripe. Is it perfect? NOPE. is it a flagship Samsung phone. NOPE. For $230,I give it some grace. RAM 8G which is so so, it supports virtual RAM up to 16G. Not as good as real RAM but MORE than serviceable. 128G of memory alright that's not great but guess what... It supports an SD card. Boom. Doesn't matter. The OS is largely free of anything I hate. It's functional. Some quirks here and there... But I adjusted pretty darn quick. The quick charge battery may be worth it alone. This thing just amazes me how quickly it charges. Is it good for the batteries longevity? I doubt it. However at $230, I don't really care. I am a POWER USER, a 5,000ma battery is good. Still not good enough for me. I figure I'd need a 10,000ma battery maybe a little more to meet my demands. The fast charge though, it gets lower than I like, blast it with the supercharger, 20 minutes later and I'm back in the game. The finger print scanner, I didn't think that it would be natural or useful where it is on the side. Not true. Dang thing works flawlessly always.True downsides. The camera... It surely isn't a Samsung. Now, I'll give it props, in full light and still photos it's adequate. Not great, but it does the job. In the dark though... Oi oi oi.... Hot garbage. The screen gets bright, it really does, but it needs to be brighter, by... Shoot I don't know: 25-35%. It's manageable though. I honestly think those are my only gripes.Its responsive and plenty fast at running the things I need it to do. I'm kind of shaken up about it because I'm not sure at this point I'll maintain my same theory about phone ownership. At $230 for.... 70% of the goodness let's say, I have a hard time thinking that $1400 for a new phone makes a lot of sense. Bravo One Plus. This is impressive.","December 1, 2023"
"OnePlus Nord N30 5G | Unlocked Dual-SIM Android Smart Phone | 6.7"" LCD Display | 8 +128GB | 5000 mAh Battery | 50W Fast Charging | 108MP Camera | Chromatic Gray",Lucian Burns,5.0,"First off, I'm not a power user, so I can't speak to processor speed, ability to game, or any of that. 3/4 or more of the time I use it as strictly a phone, I don't even have data or WiFi turned on because I don't need it. This replaced a Moto Stylus that was losing battery capacity and was old enough to not warrant replacing the battery, which isn't easy anymore.Battery life is better than the Stylus when it was new, and that's saying something.  If I'm just around the house, not using mobile data or WiFi, in a couple of days the battery may drop to 80% or so...which is pretty good because I'm in an area with lousy cell coverage, with the phone varying between towers in two different time zones. That's a battery eater, but this phone handles it well. It also seems to connect easier and with a better signal than the Stylus in the same areas. Granted the Stylus is 4g and this is 5g, but at my house there are no 5g signals, so everything here is 4g LTE.Camera? Again I'm not a professional photographer, but the camera seems to be every bit as good as the one on the Stylus, which people rate highly. The pictures I've taken have come out well and I'm happy with the camera.I rate the audio quality, of both the handset and external speaker on phone calls as better than the Stylus. The media audio has a 200% setting that is way overdrive in volume, I have some hearing loss and it's way too loud for me.Changeover was easier than I've ever had. Most of my apps transferred with their settings and passwords, and yesterday when I went to set up Bluetooth for my cheap radio in my old truck, I was shocked to find that somehow it had set up itself.... I had phone functions and BT Audio (aka Sirius) without having to pair and enter numbers. The phone also pops up to tell me about apps running in the background that are wasting battery, and gives the option to optimize them for battery life which is great.All told, I don't have many complaints. The method to power off is not instinctive, but it does prevent accidental turn offs.All in all, if you're a normal person looking for a phone first and internet toy second, I think you'll be happy.","July 30, 2024"

My dad returned his to get a new iphone because he wanted to stay with his familiar apple.. So a month later. I bought one, and let me tell ya somethin'. Don't think of it as ""cheap""... This bad boy performs like nothing else.. I don't care about load time for apps or how long it takes to turn on/restart. That's highly irrelevant. Overall use and performance is what matters. This thing is a powerhouse! 8core, 8gb ram... Expandable to 1tb sd card... Yeah. this thing has mass power.. I've used apps known to heat up and over heat phones as my performance test and this thing didn't get warm in the slightest. I also love that you can allocate unused space out of your 128gb to help the ram perform cleaner and more efficiently...I absolutely love this phone.. I love how it feels in the hands. has more freedom to customize than most ""android"" based OS's. you can actually delete apps you don't want and disable ones that don't delete..I'm very happy with this purchase and with its specs.

I have zero complaints!The dual SIM card is perfect for those that want an all in one for business and pleasure, and the fact that I can convert memory to ram really puts this thing over the top. 8g of RAM standard is already nuts for a phone and then I can have up to 16g total with conversion.

Yes I'm that person! Lol. So I was torn between this and Google Pixel 6/7. Somewhere while doing my research I came across an article that mentionedsomething  negative about the Pixel. Can't remember now what it was, but it persuaded me to go with the OneNord. I love this phone. It's solid but not too heavy. It's fast from switching from apps, tabs, and fast when charging. My only 2 complaints are 1). It seems like my Wi-Fi is constantly disconnecting on it's on and I have to constantly reconnect. Even though it's set to manually reconnect and my Internet works fine. It has to because I work from home. 2). Is that when I hold phone with my shoulder (when I'm cooking), my cheeks hits the buttons which is so annoying. (Yes I have ear buds but I lose them or have to remember where I last saw them). But the screen should lock so that it doesn't do that. Instead I have to manually lock it myself. Not a deal breaker there but the wi- fi disconnecting does have me want to look at my warranty info. If it weren't for that this phone is a keeper for me. I'm an Android woman and I don't need a lot of bells and whistles even though I'm sure this phone can do a lot. I just need to find where I put the manual..lol","December 7, 2023"

I wanted NFC, minimum of 128gb storage plus the ability to use my micro sd, 5g though 5g was not a deal breaker. As I looked I became aware a 3.5 headphone jack is rarely available on most new phones and I use that daily and it's available on the N30.I had no problems activating the phone and transferring my TracFone service, I used a TracFone sim and the menu available on the TracFone website. The phone functions well everything I was looking for. It does have one physical drawback in my mind and that is the location of the volume keys. The power is on the right and volume on the left and it's easy trying to change the volume to press the power at the same time. In OxygenOS the power button and volume down key activate the power menu to restart or power off and it's easy to press both unintentionally. The battery I'm happy with only charging once a day with the supplied charging block and cable. It will quick charge in about 20 minutes. Overall I am please with the device. The sound is wonderful, the camera good but the interface is different then I previously had. I work from home and use wifi calling without an issue.The OxygenOS is the other part, I have adjusted to most of the differences but it's not what I view as my OS of choice. An example the phone would go to sleep while I was looking at it, I looked for a setting to keep focus while I was looking at the screen but for the life of me I couldn't find an obvious named setting. I continued looking and I have changed so focus stays on but trying so many things I can't tell you which setting changed it. I use Niagra launcher and it makes a change in OS less dramatic. There are two apps I have been unable to uninstall, “Red Cable Club” and the “OneplusClock” I prefer the Google clock I’ve been using for years.I would buy this phone again, it has all the features I was looking for and some of those are being eliminated in new phones.","October 12, 2023"

Despite being about 400 dollars cheaper than my Samsung purchase, this phone has been better in every regard. It's faster, easier to use, and doesn't get hot easily when running games on high settings. The biometric features have also been more consistent and functional than my previous phone. If you're someone that values solid performance and a convenient, easy to use interface, I recommend this phone 100%. Charges incredibly fast too. I've had it for 6 months now and it is essentially in the same condition it arrived in, and I hope to see it continue to last.Note: Gaming is primarily all I use this device for, so I cannot attest to it's capacity for more demanding endeavors.","June 6, 2024"

Like any new setup, it just took a little getting used to. For example, I added a screen protector, not realizing it came with one already on it. I don't expect to upgrade for quite a while, but when I do, I probably won't even bother looking at other brands. OnePlus is the way to go - the Nord n30 feels and acts like a much more expensive device than it is.Original:I had never heard of the OnePlus brand until recently, but they seem to have a very good reputation. The Nord n30 kept topping the list of best lower-cost phones, so I took a chance and I'm so glad. My old phone was glitching a lot, basically acting like it was on the verge of total failure. I wanted to get something of reasonable quality, and fortunately, Amazon lets you pay in installments with no interest. That makes a big difference when money is tight, and at the holidays in particular.It's thin and light, and the screen is about as big as it can get without being ridiculous. That's perfect if you're 40+ and don't see as well anymore. The downside is that if you happen to have small hands, it may take some getting used to - it's just the slightest bit of a reach. The display is bright and beautiful, and it's super quick with no lagging. If you watch videos or listen to music you'll notice that the sound quality is amazing, particularly with earphones.I take a lot of photos, so the camera was important too. This one is very nice and I've gotten some excellent pics of the cat (and really, what else are cameras for?). I tested it on notoriously difficult holiday lights at night, and it did very well. Looking forward to landscapes and snow scenes. And more cat. The only thing that bugs me is I keep accidentally minimizing apps by swiping too close to the bottom where the functions are. That's something you have to acclimate to, but hopefully I'll get there soon.Overall this is an excellent choice if you want a high quality phone that doesn't cost half a month's rent.","December 1, 2023"

I paid a lot less for this phone.  I will say that spec-wise it is about equivalent and it has much faster internet access and 5G which I did not have before.  I am very satisfied with the phone except for one aspect.  The OnePlus 6 had a little slider on it.  When you go to bed, you just slide it up to vibrate only, or one more to the totally silent position.  On this phone you have to go sign in, then swipe up, then swipe down twice to get to the Do Not Disturb button and then click it.  So I have set up a schedule so it does this automatically, but I wish I did not have to do this.  This does not solve the problem if I go to a movie and don't want to not annoy others.

Once you do like I did, you get gaming, media, utilities at super fast speeds and fluidity. The screen goes up to 120hz which is basically a computer monitor in your pocket and the 6.7 inches of screen real estate was quite a shock of an upgrade coming from years of owning small expensive iPhones. Not to mention the transfer from an iPhone to OnePlus was super seamless, I had all my photos, messages, and passwords transfered without issue through the set-up screen. Which further shows how much thought and quality the Nord N30 5G truly is. The theme for this phone is called Oxygen OS which reminds me of the iPhone themes that you could only get by jailbreaking the phone and paying through a 3rd party software, they included a new interface, icons, and sounds that would cost money included with the proud ownship of this phone. Another surprising feature that is included is a thin screen protector that is always protecting the phone, so you don't have to buy another one if you want to buy I recommend it so that you can protect the screen protector because it is very thin and can scratch with regular use. The screen itself is incredible as well, I mentioned the 120hz screen but to see the colors and brightness even on lowish settings at night it is very bright for a screen, my old iPhone could not do that. On top of which, if you have a sedan or a more modern car that has a touch screen console, you will find that android auto is far better than apple carplay. The compatibility with the Nord N30 and your car is so great, the interface that you get with Android auto is much superior than carplay, so much so that carplay looks like child's play when in comparison. Overall a 300$ underdog of a device, that offers premium features like no other. OnePlus has does done a huge favor for people that aren't looking to spend 999$ on a new device.

There is NOTHING to let you know that you have a message, alert, missed call, voice mail, notification if you step away from your phone for a few minutes then come back to it... You have to remember to check it for missed whatever... I don't like that about this phone... People drive as myself & sometime  you have to step away from the phone for a minute or two. No indication of missed anything. Upgrade that & this would be a top tier phone in my opinion 😡... I almost want to return this phone cause of this missing important feature...

Great device! I've had a variety of not so great androids, with some good ones like the galaxy S2, and pixel 3. This N30 replaces my OnePlus 9 5G that's just about 3 years old and the battery wears out quickly. 3 or 4 years is normally my upgrade window. To the phone: The N30's processing ability (695 Snapdragon) is on par or better than the 9's (888 Octocore), frame refresh rate is very good, pictures look good and the speakers also work very well. Games and videos stream smoothly, and how about the external memory capability? Not many devices support that feature anymore. I've had the phone for 3 days now and recharge only once a day, takes 30-40 or so minutes. The bottom line though is this phone performs really well. I added a nice protective case with a 256 GB micro SD card and I'm at a mere $310 including tax. My 9 5G was $700 alone. Absolutely awesome value at this price point.

I came from a Motorola one ace for $350 2 years ago and it does everything that phone did and little bit more.my only major gripe is for some reason this phone only supports super fast charging on its own proprietary standardand that is the only way you'll get fast charging. I mean why reinvent the wheel power delivery is been around for a long time now and supports at least six different voltages and at least three of them cross over into oneplus's proprietary standard so the phone could definitely charge on them about half as fast but insted they lock it so it can't. I can't in good conscience rate it anymore than three stars if they're too terrified to support universal charging standards that seems kind of ridiculous and a blemish and otherwise nearly perfect budget product. The main reason why it's important is if you have a laptop steam deck or another device that uses USB c power delivery you only need to carry one charger with you this phone will still charge slowly off of Power delivery but it seems to be hard locked at 5 volt meaning you'll only get around 10-15 watts of charge which would take hours for this phone to charge.

I'm glad I did. My previous phone was a Samsung S8, it was old. I wasn't really happy with Samung or the Samsung S8, I know being an older phone, it was prolly good in its day, but just not anymore. I wanted good processor speed, all the ram, and internal storage. When I found the N30 Nord, it had most everything I was looking for, and priced right. My only question was, will it work with Verizon, and the answer is yes, I had no issues switching phones. I do have the prepaid plan. If you go to the OnePlus website, it specifically has Verizon listed. Overall, this phone was far more than I expected and then some. To be honest, the reviews were correct about the camera, it could be better, but it still does ok, and I'm happy with ok. It doesn't not have wireless charging, but it does only take about 35 minutes to recharge with the 50w charger. Not sure if it's 100% as sturdy as I would like, I just expected something a bit heavier. But just in to be safe, I put a case on it as soon as I got it. Those were my only Cons. The Pros by far out way the cons. It doesn't get warm under high usage. The ram is expandable to 16gb using internal memory. 128gb storage. And I really like the layout.

If not for the promotion, I'm not sure if I'd pay 300 because the competition is so tight BUT let's get into the good stuff.Security updates for 3 years and 1 OS upgrade - fine as most phones need to get replaced after 3 anyways8GB ram with expandable RAM based on how much storage space is available - genius move for people who don't use much storage in the first place108 MP camera - OK, does excellent in good lighting yet struggles in darker settings. The support over time should improve camera qualities. If looking for a camera at similar prices, A54 or Pixel 6a are betterBattery - great usage out the box. One hour phone call along with installing apps for another 1.5 hours only brought battery down 13 percent. This is a full day and a half batteryCharging - the reason I bought this phone. For this price range, you will not find better and more secure charging. 20-30 mins and you  are setSnapdragon 695 5G - mid range master. Power consumption is stable and a proven processor. Does not get hot while doing basic tasks which plagues higher gen Snapdragon processors like the 8 gen 1. Great for everything except for top tier gaming though what is to be expected at a sub 300 dollar phone?128GB storage - I don't think I'll be able to fill this phone up but if I did, then expandable storage by microSD card is avaiable3.5mm jack - it's still there, thankfullyOverall, extraordinarily promising IF you are ok having an only OK camera but I am 100% happy trading camera quality for fast charging/full day+ battery and proven processors with expandable RAM+Storage.Android 13 is probably the biggest brow raiser coming from 11 but that's on the OS, not the phone.","June 16, 2023"

Zero doubt.  The 50w charging from OnePlus that comes with it is insane.  At 7:15 this morning of writing this, I went from 19% (and that was left over from yesterday morning) to 90% by 7:50.  It is nuts.  Also, the camera are awesome.  I know there are some YouTube videos that talk about rating it lower due to not having an IP rating or a lower geekbench score, so yeah, if you are a HARD CORE gamer, you might want to maybe pass, and if you are so accident prone that you need an IP rating then, same, you might want to move on.  But for the price point, you can expand the memory in the SIM tray, you get a 3.5mm jack, and can expand the RAM virtually up another 8gb to 16gb.....you cannot beat it.  At all.  Plus it feels like OnePlus is getting back to the good old days of OnePlus with this one.Yeah, the back is a fingerprint magnet....no doubt, but put a case on it and you are good.  Who cares.Speaking of fingerprints....having the fingerprint sensor on the side is a natural feel and you will love it.Only thing I would recommend....if you want to spend about 70 more bucks, you can buy a refurb OnePlus 10 Pro which is insane better as far as flagships goes, but again with this one you get the expandable storage, 3.5mm, 50w charger....totally worth it.","November 7, 2023"

Some pros: the battery is amazing. It will last all day on heavy use. The processor is quick enough for email, web browsing, video and music use, and some basic games.Cons: the screen is very finicky. Often tapping a back button will somehow result in a double-tap. Scrolling down a page doesn't feel like a smooth glide but more clunky. The cellular reception on phone calls is quite poor. When indoors and on a call, often times you will be able to hear a caller but they are unable to hear you. The camera is also about mid-range quality.All in all, if you're not trying to spend $1000+ on a phone, this will fulfill your needs. If you need something with better quality and performance, the Nord series isn't for you. Please take this 3-star review as a badge of honor.

For $300, this is a great phone for the price. Coming from a $1k+ flagship (I broke the screen and was quoted $350+ for replacement) there are some drawbacks but that is to be expected.Positives; the specs are amazing, the battery lasts about 8 hours using it all day and charges fast, actually comes with a charger (unlike some trillion dollar companies), and it has headphone jack + expandable storage. I don't think there is much room to complain at this price point but I will still go over my least favorite aspects on this phone.The OnePlus UI/operating system is clunky, I prefer other Android phones. The power button is on the exact opposite side of the volume button, thus I have accidentally screenshotted dozens of times trying to power off the screen. Comes with all the Google bloatware you can think of. Camera quality is decent but definitely on the lower end, especially with competition from other cheap phones like Pixel. Would prefer a brighter screen. Main speaker on the bottom right... same spot I usually hold my phone so it muffles it a lot. Overall a good phone for the money, a great backup phone, but I might have skipped and bought something for a little more have I known the quirks about it.","June 25, 2023"

I purchased 4 month old phone on a Amazon special for $237.00 and am absolutely thrilled with it! The price point for used phones all came with refurbished batteries and the reviews came mixed. The 5000mh on the OnePlus is one of the highlights of the phone. I do not game on my phone or use it for photos/video's. The photo's are okay, but the video is only 1080p. However, if you want the android experience with a cheap price, you cannot go wrong. The OxygenOS is close to vanilla and you are able to either uninstall or disable any of the OnePlus apps which is a huge plus.Another nice feature is the fingerprint sensor, it is quite responsive and located on the side of the phone, which is much more convenient than under the screen. It makes you realize how expensive it is for all the bells and whistles that come with the major players like Samsung and Android. The only thing I don't like is just one update eligibly for the Android OS. But, for $237, I'll look past it. I connected a Samsung Galaxy watch so I can enjoy the Samsung Pay without the Samsung pricey phone. Highly recommend for the budget consumer!","October 27, 2023"

The 128GB storage space is adequate for my usage and the processing speeds on this phone have made multitasking easy. The phone has a nice, clean look and I was able to find a nice selection of phone cases for this model phone. My only gripe with this great device is the photo/video quality. Colors are often washed out and the images aren't sharp and clear as my Samsung S23 Ultra. For that reason alone, this phone can't be my main driver.

Wireless charging works flawlessly through a thick case, audio quality is perfectly clear both directions.  Hope I can keep it in good shape longer than I did my 9.","August 13, 2024"

I don't do too many live videos or take a ton of photos.This phone does a great job in everything although it's really not a master in anything outside of battery life and charging options.  I get a full day out of this phone easily.  Usually around the 1 day, 3 to 5 hour mark before I charge each day.  I usually charge when the phone gets between 20-25%.  I can leave my house at 35% or even go to bed at 15% and never worry about running out of juice.  And even if I'm low on juice, I can charge this phone from 20-100% in about 25 minutes.  I am amazed at how I can put this phone on the charger and in just a matter of 5 minutes I've gained about 20% of power.  Even when using a USB charger, it's still pretty fast.  Wireless charging is about average.  That is the phone's biggest strength.As far as talking goes, it has a good quality sound.  Coming from a Samsung 20 FE (Verizon service), I found myself missing a call now and then (goes straight to voicemail) or drops in audio when I took calls at home.  I've yet to have a problem with the OnePlus, so I'm guessing the internal anntenna is better because I'm still with Verizon.There are a lot of audio playback options available (Dolby Atmos, Spatial, etc.) and I haven't tried them all out yet, but the speakerphone sounds loud and crisp.  However, when I connect to a Bluetooth speaker or in my car's audio system, the volume tends to be lower.  I have to really crank up the volume in my car or max out my Bluetooth speaker to hear clearly.  However, maybe there's an option I'm missing in the settings that would help me.And there are a ton of options in the settings!  It can be overwhelming to someone who isn't tech-saavy, but it's not as bad as it looks.  Most of the settings are basic on the surface, but if you go into the sub-menus then it will get more advanced.  But you can control things to enhance the already superior battery life to changing your refresh rate for smoother scrolling.  Just about everything else is typical Android stuff, but OnePlus has some nice features of its own with the Floating Window and One-Hand Scrolling.The phone needs a case.  It's not easy to this phone even with both hands.  I wouldn't advise anyone try it unless they have pretty big hands.  It will probably drop as you are texting.  But that's not a deal-breaker because cases are inexpensive.The media on this phone is smooth.  It looks really good and there are options to tweak it even more.  Someone who is an avid TikTok or IG fan will be at home with this phone.  The camera takes amazing photos.  Unfortuantely, I haven't been on vacation yet to give it a real try, but what I've taken so far are very nice.  Definitely a little clearer and more realistic than my Samsung 20 FE.  Recording video is pretty impressive, too, but I've yet to do a live or video call.Anyone who pays almost double for an iPhone or Samsung is really just seeking the brand.  Yes, those phones may have a few more bells and whistles with A.I. and they may have slightly (arguably) better cameras.  But if those phones are a 10 on a scale of 1-10 then the OnePlus is a 9.  And it is much, much more inexpensive to the point that you could probably get two of these for the price of an iPhone or Galaxy 24.","April 30, 2024"

Now I have the OnePlus 12 and if they keep this level of quality up I will never switch to another brand again.Compared to the OnePlus 11:Better camerasFaster CPUBrighter displayCharges a bit fasterBuild feels more premiumCompared to the Pixel 8 Pro:CPU is not even in the same realm. OnePlus doesn't get hot unless you're really pushing it for long periods and has so much more raw horsepower.Similar level of premium build quality, but feels more comfortable in the hand due to curved edges.Wayyyyyy faster charging. This makes a huge difference for me because I use my phone heavily all day for both work and personal use. Just being able to boost the charge to 50% quickly is a game changer. Pixel takes 1.5h to fully charge most of the time even with good chargers.Camera quality is roughly the same. I compared telephoto photos at 6x to pixel's 5x and detail was very very close. As a photographer I prefer the more natural look you get from OnePlus.Price... this one is obvious. OnePlus definitely wins here.Software is good on the OnePlus. Better than it's ever been actually. Pixel has a couple of benefits here thanks to AI but I personally never used them so I can't really compare. OnePlus 12 animations feel more fluid and pleasing though.I'll update this if I run into any issues. So far the software has been roughly as stable as Pixel itself so no complains there and I hope the phone continues to work as well for me as it does now.I strongly recommend this to anyone except for those who require an S-Pen or just have extra money to spend for no reason.","February 25, 2024"

It came with its own apps. Phone, messages, calendar, email, etc... This phone comes with all Google Apps. Including the keyboard. Apparently OnePlus has given up on actually building solid apps and are just slapping Google apps into it. Had I known this I would have probably gotten a Google Pixel or Samsung phone.The allure of OnePlus was that I was freeing myself from these corporate eco-systems that harvest my data and provide no privacy. Well not anymore. With the OnePlus 12 you get the Google Phone app, Google Messenger, Google Calendar, Gmail (so none of my private email accounts I use on my own domains can be added without routing all my email through Google servers to be scanned). At least OnePlus gave me a Notes app! You can disable these apps in the app manager but you can't uninstall them.If I don't want my text messages scanned and synced with Google I could download a 3rd party texting app, same for all the other system apps. But there's two problems. First is that other apps are way less trustworthy, and secondly they often cost additional money to buy. And who knows when and how they might get ""updated"" over time.What really drives me crazy is that this phone uses Gboard, Googles keyboard. I have no idea what Google is collecting from everything I type. I really wanted a free from big tech phone. I thought OnePlus was different. This is a sad day.Other than this being a Google-everything phone, it's pretty good. The hardware is solid but the software could use some polishing. The camera is good but the built in editing software is horrendous. The camera doesn't shoot using the full amount of megapixels unless you switch it to a special mode, and then it can only shoot in RAW or JPEG... Not HEIF for some reason. Weird. Since HEIF supports 10bit and 4:2:2 color and smaller file sizes. Nope. If you want to use the full 50MP it's either massive RAW file or JPEG.The screen edges are curved. Makes it feel like a phone from 10 years ago. But the screen is bright and beautiful.By default the screen resolution is lowered, I left it that way because I can't see the difference. The power mode is lowered, again, left it that way because its so fast and snappy I can't imagine wanting more. The battery life is AMAZING... At the lowered resolution and power mode.I use Nova Launcher because I cannot stand the Google Discovery thing being baked into this phone. If you swipe all the way to the left it pulls up Google Discovery. And you can't turn it off. I hate Google and want nothing to do with their stuff. This phone really forces everything Google on you.Do I like the phone? Yes. Do I love it? No. I hope OnePlus goes back to building their own apps and not just cramming Googles into it. If in wanted Google I'd buy Google Pixel.The slogan of the OnePlus company is ""never settle."" Well, not only did they settle, they seem to have given up. And I can't settle on this phone.","July 3, 2024"

I currently have a Samsung 23+, Pixel 8 (non pro), and they are not even close in regards to the pleasant experience this phone gives. Also I have not had any issues at all.Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Android Auto, texting, calls, etc. all work very well. The speaker sound is excellent. It has a very nice screen and it's super smooth. It also has the silent slider on the side of the phone, just like the OnePlus 8T that I once had, which is very useful. The haptics are the best I've felt in any phone I've had before, comparable to pixel phones, however there are two separate haptic syles you can choose from, and they have adjustments for intensity. As for the camera, I have taken a hand full of photos and they are much better than expected. In my opinion, the photos are also comparable to the Pixel phone quality or at least very close to it; the camera also has a very good zoom if you need it.The UI is not stock Android but it's comparable in many ways, with more customization. There are a lot of useful features, such as different dark mode styles; natural tone display, which helps keep the screen color the same as the ambient lighting changes; ultra anti flicker (a huge feature for me personally), for if you are sensitive to PWM (this causes eyestrain and headaches); and many other unique features that are actually useful.","March 9, 2024"

The huge battery capacity is wonderful, and any unused storage can be used as additional ram, so F yea! Cam stats are great. The slightly less AI (compared to Google for example) can be a pro or con by personal preference, but the OS has the lease bloatware I've ever experienced which is refreshing.

The phrase ""everything is very good but not great"" applies to every aspect of this phone. In that respect, it is a lot like the Oneplus 11, just a little better in all areas. For example, the battery life is very good but not quite as good as you'd think it would be. The camera is very good but not quite as good as it could be. Same for the display, speed, the quality of the enclosure (the build quality) and every other conceivable thing a person would want out of a smartphone today, except that all of them lack SD cards. At least you get a charger with the Oneplus. Ok, I take it back, the charger is great, yep and one comes with it too ! The OS overlay, whatever it is, is good but not great. And so on. Oneplus has manged to hit the 8/10 bullseye with this because I don't have anything to complain about, except the totally needless complexity of the latest builds of Android, which is not Oneplus's fault.  And if you've seen the utterly needlessly complex latest versions of IOS, I consider Android to be less needlessly complex, by a few hairs. Could be a little cheaper but then you could say that about all high end smartphones. A totally solid choice and you don't get the feeling you've been ripped off that badly.","July 28, 2024"

It takes beautiful videos and photos, movie mode is really good for raw colors, HDR/XDR brings out more contrast between everything.Charging: It has the super charger which charges your phone the fastest on the market without heating up too much, It has tons of new heat sensors that will prevent it from overheating especially while charging and it has new vapor chambers to disperse heat more quickly.Quality: It has good build quality, it's a bit on the heavier side but honestly it makes up for it with its quality.Size: I would say the size is pretty standard, larger than my OP10P but not too big to where it's a pain.Overall it's a good, even great phone especially for the price point. If you would have got this when it first dropped they gave the higher end storage away for the same price as the lower end one, now I think you have to pay for the extra storage just like any other phone.I definitely recommend this phone, I'm looking forward to the newer OnePluses, especially with hassleblad collaborations.","July 28, 2024"

My son convinced me many years ago to try it. I really like the brand but be warned it is hard to go back to slow charging so OnePlus has a real niche. When my 9pro suffered a smashed screen, I went back to my old Samsung s22 while I considered my options.  That S22 helped me decide on OnePlus again.  I rely on phone hotspot and field a lot of calls each day for my job. Even when new my S22 would need some top off.

It seems to suffer mostly indoors with the main lens. And there's a weird push toward a lack in depth-of-field in digital imaging sensors or post-processjng (I don't know which) these days that I'm not loving too much. I don't shoot video hardly at all and a 32MP selfie cam just seems like overkill to me but, camera business aside, the phone is like a laptop you can hold and use anywhere with one hand.I'm a OnePlus guy but the last few series just didn't seem worth an upgrade and now this thing is just ridiculously powerful and anything else you can imagine in a phone. It has more customization than I can really force myself to dig into and the basic stuff is easy to get to.I don't care what ColorOS folks say—OxygenOS is more than anyone needs. I don't need color notification icons on my lock screen. Give me a break. If I need thousands of wallpapers and stuff to choose from, the Zedge app is free and exhaustive.And I'm not much on style, to be honest, but the backplate on this (green) thing is the most gorgeous device surface I've ever seen. I really didn't think the blue backing on the 7 Pro could be beaten. Fuh-gettaboutit. I wish I could bring myself to use the thing without a case, it's that attractive.This thing (the 512GB/16GB version) has as much storage as my laptop and twice as much RAM. It charges from 0-100% wired (CHARGER INCLUDED IN THE-BOX HERE—SAMSUNG, GOOGLE, SONY!) in a half-hour and wireless in an hour AND the charge seems to last forever. Sometimes it seems like it takes an hour or two for the indicator to come down off of 100%. The old, nagging ""Where's the charger?"" feeling is really nice to be over but admittedly not completely banished from my head yet. It honestly feels like I only need to charge it in my car (SUPERVOOC 80w Car Charger only $20 here) for a few minutes a day and never at home. I'm seriously considering turning on the ""charge only to 80%"" battery life saving thingy-ma-bob/feature/setting.The performance is just breathtaking. I honestly don't think I'm going to bother replacing my 6-year-old Dell Inspiron when it finally gives up the ghost. As good a value as it is compared to other brands' flagships, $900 is not what I originally set out to spend on a new phone. No complaints, though. I understand the effects of post-COVID Tech economics and I'll just have to sacrifice somewhere else. Hopefully it'll hold up for another 5 years or so like the 7 Pro did.OnePlus really knocked it out of the park with this one. :)","March 28, 2024"

The watch2, I purchased with this and it is great as are the new earbuds..color 💚 green is amazing..the snapdragon OS and Oxygen android update fixes any and all issues previously such as android Auto disconnects..Absolutely best phone for the money..one charge lasts more than 2 days!!💞💞💞","July 23, 2024"

I was wrong and I will never go back. This is the best phone you can have and you can save some money too. Everything is outstanding on it, Battery life for 2 or more days, then I can connect it to the charger for 20 mins and that's it, I don't have to worry anymore for Battery or charging times, nothing, a tremendous relieve for sure. I consider everything else better than previous phones and a better value than iPhone 14 pro max and Samsung S23 Ultra (My previous) so I can recommend it to anyone without any hesitation.07/13/2024Downgraded to 3 stars cause of Oneplus updates.I used to love my OP12, but after the last update ( June-July/2024) this phone is a mess, extremely buggy, Gmail is frozen every 2 or 3 times I open it, I cannot hang up calls, sometimes the call does not go thru in or out, I have missed several calls from my work team and relatives as well, some apps are not working or stopped working in the middle of something. I had to buy an iPhone 15 in a rush to avoid communication issues both at home and work (Since I'm working remotely). It's been a very bad and sad 2-3 weeks till I decided to switch for good, I cannot wait for a month to the next update to see if everything has been fixed. This is an amazing phone and I loved it, also I have the Oneplus watch 2 and this is a killer combination, I did forget about chargers and charging time with this two and it is a shame that this is happening to this flagship. I think Oneplus must take note on this and never have the same mistake again, this is not a cheaper device either. Disappointed.BTW I was using it on Google Fi (eSim) without issues till the last update.Also, solutions: In crashed apps you have to close and reopen them, most of the time they are working again. No need to clear cache or anything else, at least I do not have to.For calls: Worked for me to change the audio to Speakers during the call and then hang up, be aware that sometimes when you do it the phone app hang up by itself (It is randomly). I never tried the airplane mode, but some people say that is working too for this.For missing calls, I did not find a solution, Google Fi customer service did not know what was causing it.","June 3, 2024"

I was using with Mint Mobile and when I installed my SIM, it didn't work. If you're going to use Mint, here's a tip. When they send you a SIM card, they send 2 cards! The one you ordered, and another, for a friend!?! But I wasn't expecting 2 SIM cards and had no idea there were 2 in the box, so I just opened the box and installed the first card I found, not thinking there was another one. Turns out I installed the extra card which they give you to give a friend LOL? Kinda strange, right! Once we figured out that was the issue, it was smooth sailing. I installed the other SIM that was there, unbeknownst to me, and it worked like a charm. I also tested it briefly with TMobile, and it worked without any problem. So the phone is unlocked and I can vouch that it works on those networks. Pro tip: If you need Mint support, it's better to get phone support if you can, because chat support was definitely much less informed of how to troubleshoot my issue, and I almost thought I'd need to return the phone. Also, make sure you really want this phone before purchasing it! Because Amazon return policy forces you to do a UPS pickup on returns, if you choose to return. So you have to wait around all day for UPS to come to your door to return the phone, and it sounds like it can be a real drag. They'll also take their sweet time returning the funds to your bank. So, thankfully, I am keeping this one, and so far, I'm liking it. It's VERY zippy! Also, very slippery! Get a case, as it will fall from your hands constantly! Good luck.","March 9, 2024"

Since LG is out of the phone market now I had to find a different phone to replace my Velvet 5G. After looking at options for almost 2 months I heard about the OnePlus 12. Got it on the monthly no interest plan with intent to keep it if I liked it or send it back if I didn't. To be honest this phone is pretty much perfect. 16GB of RAM + the phone's ability to use extra storage as temporary RAM is almost obscenely fast for a mobile device. 512GB of on board storage will hold pretty much anything I could need for the foreseeable future. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 tears through games like a hot knife in butter, and the phone automatically adjusts settings for best experience. Now that brings me to the final piece of this pie: the battery. This sucker is massive, and paired with the included power brick and charger cable it routinely charges from under 15% to 100% in 20 minutes. I have spent 12 hours using it non-stop and barely dropped past 40%.This may come off like an advertisement but I simply cannot overstate how much I enjoy this phone. If I had any complaint it would probably be the curved screen. You'll want a case on the phone or if you're like me and have fat hands you'll routinely tap the screen on accident.","March 6, 2024"

That hasn't happened to me before with any other new phone.Third was that even though I set the battery to stop charging at 80%, regardless of it notifying that it stopped, it still kept charging the battery all the way to 100%. If it disregarded the battery's charging limit, what else would it disregard?Fourth was that the camera quality left a lot to be desired in terms of sharpness and detail, especially in RAW format.I have a OnePlus 9 and although the cameras have older sensors that aren't as good as the OnePlus 12's in difficult light situations, the pictures look sharper and more detailed. I mean actual definition, not the appearance of false detail.I decided to return it to Amazon, since the unit is clearly flawed from the factory.

Apple's are my typical daily driver for my personal phone. I picked up a Pixel 8 Pro to use as my second line for work and was disappointed. I then found this, and just wow. Love it. It is speedy, great battery life, takes great pictures, and has good sound quality. The display is really nice on this as well, and love the rounded edges of it. Been awhile since I had a phone with that. This has not replaced my 14 Pro Max for several reasons, I do reach for it more and more. That says something.","May 28, 2024"

This is an amazing device and a home run from OnePlus.

It was so good, that every phone since the 7T McLaren just couldn't reach the bar that phone set. Now here's the 12. And this is the one. This is the keeper, and will be my next daily driver for hopefully the same amount of time as my 7 series! Camera in this phone is absolutely brilliant. The screen is bright-Very Bright- and smooth as butta. Colors are vibrant, sound is clear, and very easy on the eyes. Battery?!? Did someone say battery? This thing is a beast!

Here's a closer look at its strengths and weaknesses:Pros:  Excellent Battery Life: The 5500mAh battery is truly impressive. On moderate usage, you can easily get a full day or even two on a single charge.  Blazing-Fast Charging: The 100W SUPERVOOC charging is incredibly fast. You can go from near empty to a full charge in about 26 minutes, according to OnePlus.  Powerful Performance: The Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor, paired with 16GB of RAM in this configuration, delivers smooth performance for everyday tasks and even demanding games.  Great Display: The 6.78-inch 120Hz ProXDR display is bright, clear, and responsive, making it a joy to use for watching videos, browsing the web, or gaming.  Large Storage: With 256GB of storage, you have ample space for apps, photos, videos, and other files.Cons:  No Wireless Charging: This might be a dealbreaker for some users who have grown accustomed to the convenience of wireless charging.  Uninspiring Design: The design leans toward the generic side and doesn't offer the same level of flair as some other flagship phones.  Lacks Versatility in Cameras: While the 50MP main sensor takes decent photos, the overall camera system isn't as versatile as some competitors, lacking a telephoto lens and offering only a basic ultrawide sensor.  Software Update Concerns: OnePlus offers only two years of software updates for the 12R, which is less than what some other manufacturers provide.","April 21, 2024"

First week with it, the only thing I can stress is remember the R when purchasing accessories.  I don't recall if I picked the case due to it being suggested or if I found a case separately.  What I can say is the case I have doesn't cover the cameras as well as it would, and the power button doesn't sit well in the fitting on the case.  I reviewed my orders and saw the case was for a OnePlus 12 and not a OnePlus 12R.  That being said, it was probably my fault and I ordered a new 12R case and will eat the loss on the first case.  Not a big deal.  Battery drains significantly faster than my previous phone, but it was a powerhouse (Ulefone Power Armor 18T), so my basis for comparison is quite a bit larger/longer lasting.  The processing power and speed is way up from the Ulefone though.  Ultimately happy with my purchase.  This phone is wafer thin and insanely light compared to the Ulefone as well.

One of the things that blows my mind is how fast you can fully charge the battery, put the battery in smart charge mode, expand the RAM memory without the need to buy a RAM memory card, and the built-in speakers. Apparently somebody was thinking outside of the box when this phone was in development. They understood the critical importance of battery life and performance along with RAM memory. For instance I expanded my RAM memory from 16 gigabytes of RAM to 24 gigabytes of RAM by simply sliding the slider switch in the settings and what a huge difference it made. No freezing up of any apps, quick responses when launching an app or apps etc.Although this phone does not have a memory card slot such as an SD card slot for external storage it more than makes up for that and you can get around that easily: You can share your files or photos very easily by 1. Transfer them using Bluetooth from or to your computer or another phone. 2. Tether to your computer or utilize NFC. This phone has two SIM card slots meaning if you want to add another number for business use you can do that without having to buy an extra phone - what a real convenience and money saver.This phone is very intuitive and informative on many levels. The weight and feel is very nice and the appearance. There are a lot of hidden features and tricks within this phone. When the phone's battery is in smart charging mode and I highly recommend that the phone will record your charging habits thereby increasing the battery life based on your charging habits. In case you're wondering it only takes half an hour to fully charge the phone. I end by repeating my words are not adequate enough on how awesome this phone is for the price. Is it worth the price? ABSOLUTELY! Way to go Nord!","July 1, 2024"

Actually a whole week, she flat said the battery lasts all day, pictures are 10x better and it charges in like two seconds. And everything is just faster.  She has been super impressed with it.Owning now the 12 (me) and 12r (her). You honestly can't go wrong.If you asked me whats the biggest difference is of the two the 12 camera is far better. BUT the 12R can hold it's own and takes amazing shots. The detail and saturation is wonderfull. She even took some video at our son track meet. Said I can't belive how clear the video is and you can here all the sounds. And on a personal side note here the 12r is superrrr easy when it comes to shots and video recording. Can I tell the speed difference in the two nope they are both just as fast.If this is what the one plus has to offer and these hold up ill stick with one plus phones.And the os system is little different but my wife is not a tech person at all. She figured the thing out pretty quick which surprised me and even our teenage son. Ha!!So if your one the fence buy one. In a nut shell you get more bang for your buck.Oh and she's loves the alert slider and finger print sensor.Guys these phones are bad a**","May 18, 2024"

Sims,5.0,"This is my first OnePlus phone, and I came from a Google Pixel 7 pro. So my expectations were high for this phone. I'd say it definitely exceed my expectations. Quality and finish of this product is top level. The signal of reception and wifi I get is of the charts. Way better than the old phone I had. Charging is top of the level, my phone is able to charge from 2% to 90 in 45 minutes. Battery life is also a big factor. I get about 10 hours of battery life from 100% to 15% which is way better than my old phone. My Google Pixel 7 Pro only got 7 and 30 minutes of battery life. Which three hours is three hours. The display is also very high quality for 1080p. Very snappy, colors are vibrant and the addition of this display supporting HDR10+ and Dolby Vision is amazing at this price point. OxygenOS 14 is also above average but I do which they had some of the options of the Google Pixel system options. The speakers are also great, the support of Dolby Atmos does the job of keeping everything sounding amazing. I would definitely be buying more products from OnePlus and recommending to people that are looking for a new phone.","July 12, 2024"

I had been an iPhone user for a decade and I recently upgraded to a 2024 Razr Plus because I was getting bored of iOS and wanted to see what Android was like. I had that phone for about a week and while it had a lot of cool features, a lot of things just didn't work properly. Also the cameras are pretty bad on that thing. Since I was in my 14 day window I was able to return it but since they already took my 14 Pro as a trade in, I needed a backup phone to use temporarily until the iPhone 16 Pro comes out mid-September.I saw the OnePlus 12R and didn't really know much about it since America tends to only really talk about what Apple, Samsung, and Google put out. So I ordered the phone and when it got here a few days ago I headed into T-Mobile to return the Razr and activate the 12R. The employees were enamored by the 12R and raved about OnePlus as a brand and wished they still carried those phones.It's now been 3 days since I've activated the 12R and I am completely in love with this phone. Everything just works properly. It's a night and day experience over the Razr which also costs over double what this phone is. This is no longer a temporary phone until the iPhone comes out. I'm not switching back. I'm ready to dive fully into the OnePlus ecosystem. I just can't believe a phone this cheap operates almost entirely at a flagship level.When the OnePlus 13 comes out in December, I'll be getting it day one.","September 2, 2024"

Was waiting to see what deals would arise from the OnePlus options and keyed in on this phone at $400 (which then dropped to $350 on Prime Day) and wow is it awesome.Definite flagship feel. Screen brightness and color are great, doesn't overheat like the Pixel, good connectivity on AT&T in a variety of areas (urban and wild, state-to-state) and is snappy regardless of multitasking. I love the OnePlus OS too—clean like Pixel but better gestures and sophisticated feel; major reason I came back. I'm an unusual modern phone user in that photo quality doesn't bother me but it is a few years lagging behind Samsung/Apple.Big Plus!: it charges super fast with the included charger. I charge it only during the day for about an hour or so a day and it never dies! I was always the guy heh-heh-ing that I forgot to charge my phone at night so I was battery budgeting. Never again! I just plug it in for 10 minutes and get enough charge for most outings.If you're not looking for a gaming phone, top-tier camera, or Apple then this is a best deal phone.","September 2, 2024"

I've only noticed it when it's charging.Comes with an applied screen protectorQuite loud as well so the sound is very goodBattery life goes without saying. On basic use by the end of the day I have about 60%. Of battery .. Heavy use days it gets to about 15% but always lasts through the dayMore than 8 hrs straight of video useThe badThe phone is quite slippery out of the box. Looks fantastic but is unrealistically slippery. You'll need to buy a coverIts hanged on 2 apps over the 3 months I've had it : Gmail and YouTube but you can still switch around apps and kill them very quickly. Problem disappeared once the app was restartedCamera at night (in the dark)  isn't great but if you're not too serious about taking photos at night you won't notice it.

I'm not sorry.This phone charges quickly, the battery is long-lived, and the screen is extremely responsive even with a screen protector.

Then you can go back and ""enable"" the Google app again.If the Google page then comes back, as it did on my phone, repeat that process but then go back into Settings, go to ""Home Screen and Lock Screen"", then select "" Lock Home Screen layout"". That prevents any changes to the home screen and should get rid of the Google page for good.But that's the only thing about this phone I've disliked.

I tried it on Mint which uses Tmobile and got 315 MBs in Pocatello, Idaho. U.S mobile you can use either Tmobile or Verizon and it worked for me using a sim card. However, if you ask for support in message they will say they don't. I have an activated Verizon-based SIM I use in my Samsung Z-FLIP 4 that I swapped to the 12R to see if it works it does and I get good speeds just not Tmobile speeds so yes it works but you won't have tech support for it not to mention  U.S mobile tech is kinda sketchy anyways. Cricket you can pretty much forget about as they want to sell you proprietary devices as well as the Big Three Verizon, Tmobile, and ATT. I think on the other MVNO's the sim will work without tech support E-sims are out for now.If you go purely by specs and forget about wireless charging it is one of the better phones that has just ok cameras. The one thing I think tech reviewers have ignored but is a major part of a user is ECO-SYSTEM. Gemini makes me scream for Bixby or even Alexa the AI is so biased and untruthful. The messaging sucks.There is no theme store or font, etc. In the photo above you see a copy of a theme from Samsung that it brought over when it copied my phone. This phone has some nice features such as a nice screen I leave it in Vivid mode. Samsung forces you to buy the Ultra to get this type of screen. For me, the fast charging is cool , but seems kind of bull you have to get the 12 at a much higher price to get wireless. The apps run fast and you get three years of OS updates and 4 years of security. I think in three months when this is paid off I'm giving it to my kid and getting myself a Samsung 23 FE.","March 6, 2024"

It was fast, the battery life was pretty good, although not as great as the reviews I read led me to believe. The phone really does charge from 0-100 in 30 minutes. It was amazing. They do give you the option to remove items from your status bar to prevent screen burn or just to customize to your liking, which was helpful.  But there were some things I didn't like. There is no always on display. It just turns on when you move your phone. But it's not ""always on.""  The facial recognition works great, but I could not get it to read my fingerprints properly. It was very frustrating.  I also tried to transfer some photos  to my computer and was unable. The One Plus folder kept freezing on my laptop. I've never had this happen with any other phone. But the deal breaker for me was that one plus does not allow users to customize the Do Not Disturb feature. I turned my notification slider to the silent position and turned on do not disturb and an alarm still went off in the middle of a meeting. I called one plus customer service and was told that they do not allow any alarms to ever be silenced on their phones. You have to go into your alarm app and silence it from there. Even trying to lower the volume to zero is impossible. You can still hear the alarm on the lowest setting. I tried using do not disturb, the notification slider, and the Zen mode app. Nothing worked. This phone isn't super expensive, but it costs enough for me to be able to expect to silence my phone if I want to do so. Returning!! This was my first time trying a OnePlus phone. Until they change that feature, I will not be trying them again.","March 26, 2024"

Unlocked for your phone carrier and you could also unlock the bootloader too and root, install custom roms etc. I bought this at the time since it was one of the last oneplus phones that gave customers access to msm tools which allows you to restore your phone if you somehow mess up installing custom roms. The phone is fast, amoled screen looks nice and crisp. The snapdragon 888 processor is fast but it does heat up. I've rooted the phone and simply underclock it so it actually stays nice and cool all the time and even extends the battery life.If you're deciding between an older flagship and a midrange phone, I think pretty much you're always going to get a better deal with an older flagship (betters specs) unless you need a specific feature from a budget phone like sd card or phone jack.My only real complaint about this phone is the in-display fingerprint reader. It's not as fast as back fingerprint readers but I can't blame oneplus as android a whole has moved towards using in-display finger readers. Also if your thumb is slightly wet then it likely won't read your fingerprint.","September 27, 2023"

Having read about One Plus Oxygen being an open source port of Android that gets pretty good reviews I decided to go for the One Plus 9 5G. My carrier is Google Fi, and I was so disappointed they started selling Samsung phones, of which I'm not a fan at all.First thing I noticed after purchasing it was the fit and finish is quite nice. It's not a brick, not svelte per se, but it has a good weight to it. The width was a welcome change from the Pixel 3XL. That minor reduction in width made this much more capable as a single hand phone. I'm not one to really care about fingerprints but you will get fingerprints all over the back and the face...again, whatevs.The speed. Out of the gate, when I dropped my Google Fi sim into the device the first thing I noticed was the speed. This is a fast tight phone. Which I do appreciate. Especially since my Pixel was on it's last legs and I really did need a replacement that would be a decent upgrade.If you purchase the unlocked version you should be aware of a few settings so your coverage is taking advantage of both WiFi calling/data, and roaming. Which sort of leads me to believe that since you have to make those adjustments in the settings menu. I wonder how many people have purchased the phone and thought, damn my coverage is awful with this thing.  So, I ding them for that....but then, this isn't a on and done purchase. You have to do a bit of finagling with the hardware. Welcome to Android....lol.Charging. WOW...just WOW. I have a 15w wireless charger I used with my Pixel and it charges the One Plus 9 5G...just fine....and...not sure I get why people complain about the wireless charging but in my experience it's just fine. At work I charge it connected to a docking station and.....it's FAST. And that's using my Pixel charging cable.Battery life. I don't think this is intended as a battery sipper. it will go through a full charge in a day. With some room to spare. But overall I wasn't dismayed by the battery life. I've tested it with the various and NUMEROUS battery life extension settings on the phone, some of which are confusing...again...welcome to Android. But I like playing around with stuff like this;Camera. Love it. It's great. I've literally taken shots with my Pixel that I regard as stunning. And in the few weeks I've had the One Plus 9 5G, can't complain at all. If anything, I've noticed a depth of color in both wide  and closer shots that feels more realistic and to be honest I'm kind of shocked at how well the camera works compared to the Pixel 3XL, which...I really loved that camera, a lot. The interface is quite different but it's responsive and the level of tweeking you can do to get your shot is miles apart from the Pixel.What's not so great: Well, on the second week I scratched the screen, Just above the fingerprint sensor. I had it in my pocket with some keys, my bad, and I was kind of surprised it scratched so easily. I've had my Pixel for over 3 years, handling the exact same way and I never experienced that. The screen never had any wear at all. The scratch isn't bad, you can only see it if you look at it at an angle. But still. This concerns me.Fingerprint sensor: hit or miss. It's built into the front of the screen, which is nice. But, it takes multiple tries to unlock, and if your fingers are particularly dry, or just off from the sensor. Yes, you'll get a warning and have to enter your pin after so many tries. To be honest, this doesn't bother me that much. But it has been an annoyance a few times.Choices!: There's a LOT to play with in the settings, for me not a big deal at all, for others....gives me pause. Not sure I'd recommend this phone to someone not into having fun with the settings. Or a person that just wants to turn it on a go.File transfers to Mac: It'd be nice if I could connect the phone to my mac to transfer files. The phone automatically offers a USB driver to install when you connect it to a PC. Not so much with a Mac. There was an article on the One Plus website about enabling developer mode so you could enable USB logging so you could do file transfers....tried it, didn't work. Not a deal breaker but.....again, not the most user friendly experience.Conclusion: I like the phone, and I think it'll serve me for what I need it to do. Speed, durability and camera. 5G coverage where I'm at is, spotty, but, have noticed a speed boost when it does show up in the top menu bar...which again...wow, LOADS of icons in the top home screen menu bar...it's kinda funny. And Camera, I used my camera phone on my Pixel all the time. If this phone's camera was lackluster or a compromise I would have sent it back fast.  But from what I've experienced, especially the camera interface, I have a lot to play with and for that I'm excited.","August 16, 2021"

Came sealed new in box. Top notch quality at a very affordable price. The only real complaint I have is that there is no expandable microsd storage, but 128Gb internal is enough to get me by and it's pretty fast. Also no headphone jack, but can't really knock it for that with everyone else doing the same, still very frustrating not having it when you need it even as an audio enthusiast with multiple DAC choices. Very happy to find a good phone like this with a flat screen so I can use a regular glass screen protector and not lose touch sensitivity or the finger print reader without UV glue or a circle on the sensor, even came with a self healing TPU screen protector pre-applied.I was pretty pleased with OxygenOS as is, though I mainly got this phone so I could install custom ROMs and it was a breeze getting LineageOS on it. And even when I tweaked somthing in the ROM that I shouldn't have and it stopped booting, the factory reset process was simple and straight forward. Activated through Verizon with no issues on LineageOS.","June 15, 2023"

This one works just fine.Once you experience how fast this one charges, everything else is going to be frustrating.While I am mostly happy with the overall experience, a few camera related things bother me.1. Pro mode supports only the main camera. Why not the wide angle? You can't zoom either.2. You can't set the high resolution mode as default. The default resolution is only 12 Mega pixels! Why? Edit.. you can, after the latest update.3. The panorama mode has been improved and is much smoother. However it doesn't take advantage of the wider camera. You can't choose the camera/lens either. If you install GCam, it will give you a wider(or higher)more pixels.4. In pro mode if you adjust certain parameters and leave the rest floating, the shutter speed won't go down below a limit to compensate(unless you adjust that also manually.5. You can't zoom in in portrait mode. Why?6. The stabilization rocks(but the video is cropped compared to the photos).Lost the ability to set dark mode for individual apps with the last update.Also the Bluetooth randomly connects and disconnects if there is nothing playing.","July 19, 2021"

Not on AT&T.Camera(s) use EIS - image stabilization in software. The issue is that EIS is only in the included camera software. Using other apps to capture pics/videos do not get any image stabilization. E.g. Open Camera and dash-cam apps. This is a step back from my older phones (OnePlus 6, OnePlus 7 Pro).Good wide-lens camera, no optical zoom camera.Battery life is good, especially after Android 13 update. I get two days with moderate use.Battery gets warm during charging - not good for its life. I have to pay attention (use AccuBattery) and disconnect the charger at 80%. The phone has a optimized charging feature, but no way of stopping the charging before 100% and avoiding overheating. AccuBattery shows the battery health at 90% only already, after a couple of weeks of use. Not great prognosis for its life.We'll see how much longer OnePlus supports this phone with updates. I should have gotten a Google Pixel 6A at the same price. Somewhat lower specs but better pictures and much better/longer software support/updates.No video over USB C.

I was a long time Google Phone user (had the iPhone 4, Samsung S3, Samsung S4, Samsung S5, Moto X 2014, Nexus 5X, and Google Pixel 2 XL previously) since 2014 when Google owned Motorola. The camera is good, but deffo needs some software updates to make it even better. I love Oxygen OS because it's near stock android so it's an easy jump from my Pixel. So if you still have your Pixel, Pixel 2, or Pixel 3 and don't want to break the bank on your next phone then I'd recommend this.Something to keep in mind:The Samsung S21 is constantly on sale for around the price of this phone and it could be a hard sell if you're not into the software experience that OnePlus offers. Samsung packs a wee bit more features and specs for that price. So it really comes down the software experience you prefer.","April 29, 2021"

It kept failing to download any full or incremental updates, crashing and exhibiting UI bugs.  It eventually managed to pull and install one large OTA update, rebooted.  I expected Android 12 or 13 afterwards, nope, still android 11, but now the phone partially thinks its a Global/EU model, despite the IMEI indicating a US region.It automatically started a new, smaller incremental OTA update, which soft-bricked the phone.  Yay.  I was able to recover it from fastboot, but only by manually flashing an OOS12 image OnePlus support gave me.  After getting it running again, it refused to update anymore, despite being one Android version, 10 months and ~6 incremental updates behind the current version.What happend?  Well, OnePlus has started merging OxygenOS and ColorOS codebases, which has been a bit of a disaster and resulted in a lot of the development community and users losing confidence in the last year or so.One of the most recent incremental OTA updates OnePlus pushed out around month ago bricked thousands of devices.  OnePlus pulled the update down a week or two later, but not after a lot of 9/9pro users suddenly lost access to their devices.  I'd recommend staying away from anything newer than an 8T until OOS is in a better state.","March 19, 2023"

Don’t buy if you’re getting it for the camera.Highest video setting is automatically set resulting in a 5 min max video unless you change the settings every time you bring up your video. The video also does not transfer well to other media players. The video quality looks glitchy, blurry, shakey, etc.Also.. there is no pro B&W setting, which I found odd. Besides the camera and video settings and faults, the phone is good. But it felt pointless being an Android with the capabilities of taking great video and photos, but not being easily able to. Default video sizes and photos never matched up either. The setting options for the video is just awful.Absolutely no bloat ware. Good job Oneplus, that’s amazing. Hasselblad came through, but Oneplus falls short with real focusing on the cameras capabilities.Charges very quick with charger that comes with it.

I was waiting for the OP9 model new cameras, as this has been traditionally the ""compromise"" on previous models.I've read about the battery & heat issues reported by several users at product launch. But it seems that was  already addressed by recent updates. So I decide to buy it.Unfortunately OP has resorted to throttling apps to tackle these battery/heat issues. IMO, this is just not acceptable. Pls google ""OnePlus throttling"" and you'll find a tons of reports of this.According to the news, this throttling affects not just Chrome, but all the apps that I use for work. I couldn't believe it. So I run a test against OP5T. The results are staggering. The OP9 is way more sluggish than a 4 years old model. See the attached pictures with the benchmark results.So if you buy for the performance of the Snapdragon 888, you'll not get it (as of time of this review). If you can live with that, you'll getting a great screen and good camera package. Who knows, they may be do another FW upgrade and give the user the option to ""performance"" or ""battery""Consider it carefully before buying.","July 9, 2021"

Not as quick as I was expecting, like not jaw-dropping, but really good, and it's more consistent than 4G LTE. Easy to transfer data from my Google pixel to the 9 5G. Sensitivity of the phone is good, haven't taken too many pictures, but I took a few from outside that look nice. Surprised that even with multiple apps open, watching stocks on Webull and Robinhood, the phone doesn't get hot. That's indoor use though, if I was using it outside in the heat that might change. Altogether though, this phone's a definite recommend from me.

Scott,1.0,"This OnePlus 9 is my first OnePlus phone.The REALLY BAD:- It has a ""Game Space"" app that functions as spyware, that cannot be removed, even on phones that have no games installed.- With each update the Game Space app gives itself more permissions that are not necessary for games, including sending emails with calendar and contact information to unknown users without your permission.  (see pictures)- The app claims that these permissions can be changed, but the controls to turn them off are greyed out and non-functional.- OnePlus's response is to say ""DON'T LOOK AT THE APP"".- There was one OnePlus response that said they were going to fix it in the next android update.  It is the only reason I did not return the phone.The ANNOYING:- The battery lasts less than half a day with heavy use.  That is about the same as a 5 year old phone with a battery half the size.- This mandates that you carry a charger or power bank and a cable.- The quick charge feature is proprietary, only OnePlus chargers will use it.  The difference between 2- hours charging and a half hour charging.The GOOD:- The quick charge with the OnePlus charger does exactly what it says.  It charges really fast.- The screen response is smooth.- The 5G connectivity of the U.S. model works with T-Mobile.  The international version with dual sims does not.- The camera app seems intuitive - for someone with no camera skills like myself.In a nutshell:  If they don't make the spyware removable with the next android update, it will be my last OnePlus phone.","September 3, 2021"

"OnePlus Open, 16GB RAM+512GB, Dual-SIM, Voyager Black, US Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone, 4805 mAh Battery, 67W Fast Charging, Hasselblad Camera, 120Hz Fluid Display",Amazon Customer,5.0,"So about a month ago I decided it was time to finally break away from the apple eco system. I was sick of it. I really liked the refined design of the fold 6 and knew I wanted something that felt vastly different from a candy bar form factor.The phone was great and had a lot of features that wowed me. The AI tools were fun and silly and the screens were bright and vibrant. I got blue bubbles working at home and thought I was good to go.A week passed and I realized I wasn't in love. That damn front screen is just so narrow. I have little hands. I'm a small guy. I didn't think it would bother me. I couldn't type a sentence on it to save my life. The cases for it added such a strange cheap bulky feeling to the phone and made me feel like I was carrying around a TV remote. The inner screen was so damn glossy, I couldn't see outside or even in my apartment for that matter because it reflected EVERYTHING around me and was covered in smudges in an instant. You can't set the phone down flat on a table because of the camera placement. It was also uncomfortable to hold with those sharp corners.The one plus open has fixed all of those issues for me. The inner screen feels so much more premium and the outer screen is a perfect size. I love the anti glare inside and can't get over how shallow the crease is. I honestly even like the OS more. Coming from iOS, it's a little more inviting. Of course I miss the wireless charging and AI features, but I can absolutely live without those. The cameras are so much better and I prefer the more tasteful image processing. Samsung pics look like an acid trip, they're so oversaturated. The OnePlus open feels so much more premium and carefully crafted. I also don't really need these phones to be much thinner...I like how solid the open feels. I don't feel like it's going to break every time I unfold it. While it may not be snapdragon 8 gen 3, gen 2 runs extremely well. Battery life is absolutely better even at high performance.So happy to join the OnePlus ecosystem. Such a brilliantly balanced device.","August 7, 2024"
"OnePlus Open, 16GB RAM+512GB, Dual-SIM, Voyager Black, US Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone, 4805 mAh Battery, 67W Fast Charging, Hasselblad Camera, 120Hz Fluid Display",Dimitri,5.0,"I have owned  the Samsung  Z Fold 3, 4, and 5. There were so few substantial changes in those releases that I sold the Z Fold 5 within three months of ownership. I never enjoyed using the outer screen for anything, especially if I needed to enter data, because it was too narrow. The cameras were too much of a downgrade from their S-series phones. Although they had pen support, carrying one required a thicker case on an already large and heavy phone. I wear pants with large pockets, but the long skinny foldable would occasionally fall out while sitting down.While the Z Fold interface can be very good, there were too many duplicated apps that added little additional functionality, including their voice assistant. This unnecessarily increased overall complexity when using the phone.I also purchased the S24 Ultra with AI built in, but only for the Samsung apps. Since I don't use their browser, voice assistant, messaging, or mail I didn't have access to much AI on that phone. Plus, I had become accustomed to the larger inside screen and missed that part of the foldable experience.I then tried the Pixel Fold, but did not like its inability to easily lay flat, many apps did not display correctly on the large inside screen, it had heat issues when doing everyday things, and Google's pitiful history of pixel phone support (I have owned several early Pixel phones). I loved the outer screen aspect much better than the Z Fold.I read several reviews for the OnePlus Open that were so good I purchased one and these are my notes so far.Pros- the outer screen is the perfect height and width for typing with my larger thumbs- face unlock is more accurate and faster- it is lighter than the Z Fold and much lighter than the Pixel Fold- it charges in 42 minutes from 0%, so I do not miss or need wireless charging- its larger battery lasts longer than the Z Fold 5- while I am not a phone camera expert, my pictures are noticably better- the interface is much simpler and streamlined with minimal app duplication- I am surprised how much I like their Open Canvas multi-tasking implementation- the crease on the phone is much closer to being invisible than all  Z Folds or the Pixel FoldCons- not water or dust proof, just splash resistant- not a wide selection of good cases","June 5, 2024"

"OnePlus Open, 16GB RAM+512GB, Dual-SIM, Voyager Black, US Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone, 4805 mAh Battery, 67W Fast Charging, Hasselblad Camera, 120Hz Fluid Display",Larry A,5.0,"I have to say, I was surprised by this phone. Being a loyal Samsung user for over the last decade, I was conflicted between choosing this or the Fold 5. Eventually choosing this phone due to the better screen ratios and for One Plus's (technically) first folding phone and my first One Plus phone. Wow. Just wow.I've had the phone for around 3 days now and so far I have gotten multiple compliments. And while I can not recommend the phone currently due to the admittedly high prices of folding smart phones. I plan on recommending it when it assumedly drops in price when the next generation releases.Pros;• Perfect foldable screen aspect ratios.Unlike Samsung that insists on a thing outer folding screen in (an assumed) attempt to make people want to use the opened form of the phone. One plus instead offers a for normal outer screen. Not only meaning you can use it like a normal phone but also get a larger tablet from factor.• Invisible CreaseWhen the screen is folded open the crease is probably the best currently on the market. Unable to be seen unless held at angles that you would never even think of looking at the phone at unless you wanted to see the crease.• Battery LifeSo far I have only gotten below 50% battery after regular use of the phone in one day. That day being the first day I got the phone, when it arrived at 50% battery.• ChargingThis phone will charge FAST. I've put this charge at charge around 60% and came back 20-30 minutes later to see it fully charged.Cons;• PriceNow this is a problem with all main foldable phones currently on the market but yeah... I honestly can not see foldable becoming main stream until they are able to be brought down in price. Though that is probably still a few years off.• SoftwareNow this is not a dig at Oxygen OS as it so far feels like a good skin on the great Android OS. But some apps act weird when swapping between open and closed modes. Stretch long or squishing. I don't know if this is because these apps have only focused on working well on screen sizes similar to the Galaxy Fold but it is an issue where I sometimes have to close out of apps when swapping between screens just to not deal with awkward lay outs. Besides that though so far everything has been great.","April 6, 2024"
"OnePlus Open, 16GB RAM+512GB, Dual-SIM, Voyager Black, US Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone, 4805 mAh Battery, 67W Fast Charging, Hasselblad Camera, 120Hz Fluid Display",Dimitri,3.0,"This review will mostly be for people with current flagships looking to get into the foldable market, Iphone user for 10 years recently swtiched from a iphone 14 pro max to the Galaxy 23 ultra earlier this year and couldnt have been happier, but ive always had an itch to try out a foldable, so when i seen one plus coming out with one that was more on the normal side of a cover screen and incredible specs i thought id try it out, first impressions, build quality is crazy nice, feels great, lightweight very snappy open and close, and having never used a foldable before, the inner screen is insane, you will never notice the crease and its so hard to feel so major props to one plus for that, mostly everything you see on the youtube reviews is true so ill skip most of that, but the question that stands is it worth swtiching from a flagship, and the answer is no. Cover screen which you'll probably be using at least 60% of the time is just way to small still compared to the s23 ultra or an iphone pro max, software just isnt there yet either very laggy compared to other flagships, lots of apps dont work on the cover screen, but surprisingly work on the inner screen? Also apps that have either face id unlock or biometrics on Samsung and Apple dont exist on the one plus which is VERY frustrating, having to type in a password for an app everytime is annoying it doesnt even let you save it on there regardless if its with biometrics or not, and this isnt all apps its just some, just like some apps not fitting the cover screen or inner, just a few i ran across in my case, while we're on that note though, i will say one plus has the quickest biometrics ever, truly incredible, lastly their software ""phone clone"" sucks its absolutely nothing compared to apples or Samsungs and when switching brands like that it makes it so much easier and more convincing to do so and it was just so annoying swtiching all my stuff and settings over manually, so in conclusion its a great phone, incredible build quality, beautiful screens, amazing cameras, speakers are the best out there, switching from another foldable, probably worth, going from a flagship, probably not. while its a great phone, you're still giving up quite a few things, id love for foldables to be on par with flagships but we're just not there yet.","November 30, 2023"
"OnePlus Open, 16GB RAM+512GB, Dual-SIM, Voyager Black, US Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone, 4805 mAh Battery, 67W Fast Charging, Hasselblad Camera, 120Hz Fluid Display",Dimitri,5.0,"First - people either love ""fold"" cell phones or they hate them.  I love them.  I've used a couple of Samsung's Z Folds.  My only negative for the Samsung Z Fold is - when not folded - the screen is too narrow.  So when OnePlus announced they were going to have a Fold (Open) - I was excited.  Because they were coming out with one - and because it would get me back in the OnePlus family.  I had the original - OnePlus One, then 3, then 6, N200, then 9.For me there's no problem with their launcher/operating system - OxygenOS.  But I do flip between OOS and Microsoft Launcher because I like variety.  I did that with my Samsung phones too.  I like change.  What can I say.I like the feel in my hand.  I like that the front screen is wider - and when open the screen is bigger.  I like that there aren't a bunch of preinstalled stuff that you don't want to use - and some of which you can't uninstall.  OxygenOS is a pretty clean operating system - no unnecessary bloat - i haven't had to remove any apps.I am having an issue with making/receiving calls when WiFi is on - my cell provider (cough t-mob cough) just told me ""turn off WiFi"" which is them saying - it's not our problem.  And to be transparent - I had the same issue with with my cell provider branded Samsung Folds - no or spotted calls when WiFi was on - and got the same response from my provider - ""turn off WiFi.""  And yes - that does fix the sympton - not the root cause.I have reached out to OnePlus support - they responded very quickly - asked me for some information that my cell provider never asked.  So we shall see.  It's not a deal breaker for me because I have unlimited calls/text/data - so I can keep WiFi off.  Would be nice to have it on when I'm streaming music and video, etc.Anyhow - to wrap up - great phone - love how fast and clean it is - and love being back with the OnePlus family again.","November 30, 2023"
"OnePlus Open, 16GB RAM+512GB, Dual-SIM, Voyager Black, US Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone, 4805 mAh Battery, 67W Fast Charging, Hasselblad Camera, 120Hz Fluid Display",Jon C.,4.0,"So, I wasn’t supposed to purchase a phone, let alone a foldable because I was a happy Surface Duo user, however, circumstances dictate for me to purchase a new foldable because my Duo slipped out of my pocket and dropped. At first, the screen was still responsive even though there were cracks all over it, but little by little the responsiveness declined. Luckily, OnePlus was released just in time I was looking for a new foldable. You are probably asking, why didn’t I have my Duo repaired? I would if I could, but I am currently living out of the US, and I cannot just send my device for repair. I will when I return state side.Why did I select OnePlus over the like of Samsung Fold and Pixel Fold. For one, I was looking for a phone that emulates the Surface Duo’s ability to multitask. After trying both devices, I decided to go with the OnePlus Open based on multiple reviews online on how it handles multiple apps at the same time. Granted, it is a leap of faith decision since where I am at, the foldable isn’t available at all – thanks Oppo!Now that I have had the phone for a month, I’m happy to say that I enjoy using the device and all its quirks. For one, the widgets are not expandable when you open the device. They are all on the left side of the screen, and you cannot move it in the center of the screen. It is not a deal breaker, but it would just be nice to see whatever widgets that’s on the front screen to be in the middle of the device when you unfold it.Microsoft Teams (school or work) is sometimes quirky with this device. When you tap to answer a notification while using both screens. The app for some reason has multiple sessions on the left side of the screen. You must navigate back close those sessions before you can respond.Luckily, from what I have read, Microsoft is giving love to this device, as it will bake the Link to Windows feature into the OS soon (Oxygen 14) – ala Samsung. I hope that Microsoft will work out some of the issues with MS Teams with the manufacturer as well.Now that the cons are out of the way, here is a list that I like about the device:Battery Optimizer - tells you when an app is draining the battery, and the battery last exceptionally longFast Charging - it is extremely fast when you use its charger!Weight - noticeably light compared to the rest of the foldables I've triedAnd of course, the camera, but that is a different topic!I am glad that I had that leap of faith and purchased this device, and for now, my Surface Duo 2 will take a rest.(I'm giving this device four stars for now, but I will update this review once Oxygen OS 14 is released. Maybe then, I can give it 5 stars.)Update: After receiving the latest Update for the device, the system is still marred with the same dual screen issue for some Apps. While functional, you can tell that it isn't natural for a foldable, as it tries to run the app in full screen. The same goes with Microsoft Teams as I mentioned above.Link to Windows is fully baked, and from what I can tell, it is functioning as it should.Keeping it at 4 stars.","December 30, 2023"

After doing research on the best folding phone I landed on this one.I think its a brilliant phone when it comes to the camera, screen and software features. Oxygen OS is amazing and I hate to admit it, but far superior to iOS in my humble opinion.That being said, customer support for this device is non-existent. My mother-in-law accidentally dropped my phone, and even though it was in a pretty rugged case, the internal screen got damaged. It's been over a month since I started the repair process with One Plus directly, and they told me today that they haven't even inspected it. On top of that, I called several phone repair shops here in Southern California, and they estimate they might have repair parts in a year.Which ultimately leads me to this:The fact that getting a device repaired is such a pain makes it completely impractical. I would rather have inferior hardware and software, but I know that if an accident happens or my device breaks, I can get it repaired or replaced quickly.","September 5, 2024"

The camera, responsiveness and multiple app software experience is much better.However I bought one when it first came out and in about one month the screen got a dead pixel that eventually went across the entire inner screen. My fold 2 & 3 both eventually had issues with the inner screen but they lasted at least a year before any issues.Normally getting a replacement would not be an issue but because this phone doesn't allow you to do a direct replacement I had to wait a whole month while it was rma until I eventually got it.And within two weeks the screen on the new phone went completely black and no longer turns on.So now I think I won't bother with the month long replacement.","May 10, 2024"

After buying and testing it for a week I can say with 100% certainly this is the best foldable. However it does have a couple flaws that take getting used to but I believe the feature and performance more than make up for it. The fingerprint reader is pretty small meaning it will definitely take about 2 trys before unlocking your phone due to it small scan area. 2. No wireless charging for me not a big deal but for some it's definitely a pain point. Lastly the volume buttons are way to high and I have big hands. Most of these are not picks though which is a good sign for the phone. Otherwise the cameras are nothing super special but fine they definitely need a good amount of light to get the perfect shot. The screens are bright and the crease is very very hard to see and you can barely feel it. But what made this phone different for me is the battery. Simply outstanding. All day battery on a foldable with very heavy use is truly remarkable and even if you manage to drain it, it charges at 67W with the included adapter meaning you can plug in your phone to to the bathroom come back and it may have 8 or 10 percent back leave it for 30mins and you're nearly full. Overall if you can stomach the price which is 100 less than the competition the buy this. All other choice pale in comparison.

Really, I did.  But, I don't.  The screen size is good both when closed (like a regular phone) and when open (like a small tablet).  But, the operating software itself is, to put it nicely, very buggy and I personally find the larger screen of limited use.  There just isn't enough software optimized for it to make it valuable.  That said, the stuff that is designed for it is really quite nice.Unfortunately, the camera ""bump"" is more like a mountain and is extremely obtrusive.  Like, really, really huge.  And what in the absolute **** is up with a phone in 2024 that does not have wireless charging built in???  Yes, the high-speed wired charging is great.  But not being able to simply top-up with your car's wireless charger or missing the convenience of just dropping it on a Qi charger when going to bed is absurd.  Absolutely no excuse for omitting it.Overall, a cool idea but not ready for prime time in my opinion.  I'll be going back to a Samsung flagship soon.","February 5, 2024"

The build quality is excellent, the external display is actually usable (unlike the fold), and it is fun! I prefer Apple phones but they are more the same and aren't changing much  Defected this time from the 15 pro max (iPhone flagship phone) and actually enjoying the shift as the phone functions exactly as an online reviewer stated in that it is a great phone for someone wanting a functional foldable in both fold and unfoldable modes that also wants a fun phone that serves a lot of functions and roles at once. The negative reviews on here seem to be random, specific phone errors (that all phone types have) or perhaps they thought a foldable phone could be used like an old Nokia Brick phone and damaged the inner screen (hint: it's foldable glass, you can't be brutal which it)... If you want a foldable and a fun phone, this is probably your best option. If you want a phone that is near flawless as a normal touchscreen experience that hasn't really changed in years, go iPhone. I'm enjoying the shift though and will be finally be staying with an Android for more than a few months!","December 2, 2023"

It's not user-friendly and struggles with simple tasks, even breaking the weather app widget by not displaying information correctly.- Battery life is better than the Galaxy Fold but still can't last a full day.- Charging speed is only fast with the included charger; any other charger results in below-normal speeds.- Lack of wireless charging.While I love the phone's form factor, the numerous flaws and a subpar OS make it too much of a sacrifice to use this phone.

The oneplus software was not getting in the way much with this phone. They embrace googles programs which makes the experience really nice.

The phone is still available for sale just not for me. Think twice before buying a cellphone from Amazon. Very disappointing as it was a suppose to be a gift.,"November 29, 2023"

But it is like the title says “best foldable of 2023” hands down. Wider outside display, excellent cams and it even has stylus support not only on the inside screen but outside, too. You can use a cheap stylus from amazon, if you don’t mind not having all the features. Or you can basically wait for one plus to get their stylus on the market(amazon). So if you are thinking of a foldable i would buy it and try it out, you can return it if you are not satisfied. Thank you OnePlus and amazon.","October 29, 2023"

Update: Had to factory reset due to constant random resetting during WiFi calls and other tasks. Also found brick dead twice. After reset, no issues, yet. I'll give it a few more days. Update 2: Even after the factory reset, and a few hopeful days using everything else I like about the phone, it started to randomly reboot. This is a deal breaker. Edit Dec 25: I updated the software; crossing fingers that there's no more random reboots. Last edit: 1 star.

Below are some pros and cons.CONS:- Camera is mediocre, unless you are taking still photos (which are fantastic)- WiFi speeds are not in the same league of even a prior gen Samsung/Apple flagship devices. I have a S22 Ultra and this, and in the same location, the S22 ultra will show speeds upwards of 870Mbps, whereas in OnePlus Open will not cross 500. Yes, it may not be a deal breaker, but with most homes nowadays having a lot of IoT devices, bandwidth/ speed are all limiters. ALSO: Ensure to turn off ""Private DNS"" which will otherwise cause speeds to be EVEN MORE slower (!!)- Apps sometimes quit and need to be force stop and reopened. May or may not be an Android thing, but seems to happen more on this than my S22 Ultra- Compare the photos from this phone vs the S22 ultra (or S23 or s24) and those are noticeably better/ sharper. All these phones have AI and processing power, so no excuses for the camera being bad. But yes, the software is not up to the mark which could be the difference.PROS:- Screen and display. Size and clarity are fantastic- Still photos from the camera are excellent, with good clarity- Audio quality is really good on both phone / video calls and music, etc- The device is fast (exception of WiFi)MEHs:- Even in places with good towers nearby, the 5G speeds are almost useless (lets' not get started on the whole is 5G worth it discussion)- Phone does get noticeably warmer with using maps for a couple of hours or video playback for couple of hours- Battery life is okay, nothing to write home aboutOVERALL:While it is not a stellar phone for the pricepoint, it is definitely good. And hope it gets better with more OS updates. Will not buy another OnePlus until these improve though.","May 22, 2024"

With incentives with trade-in (OnePlus 8 Pro) and repeat buyer, I got this phone for $350 less than retail. Still a bit steep for its design.I will get right to the point with my issues and hope that updates will address the issues:Apps do not realize that the phone is a folder. I play games, I run programs. Switching from full screen to front screen or vice versa the Apps do NOT RESIZE correctly. It just skews big to small or stretches from small to big. App must be restarted to correctly fit the screen.Game apps do not position correctly. I had a Fold it always sized the view area and positioned the app in a useable manner. This phone does NOT support full screen apps correctly...it is what I called center skewed.Screen brightness algorithm is very arbitrary. Screen gets bright if you turn it up manually. Outside in the bright sun it is visible when you MANUALLY turn up screen brightness. It does NOT automatically set screen brightness even when it is enabled, annoying. In a dark warehouse, on odd occasions the screen turns on with setting at 1/3 brightness...it is way too bright for my inside needs.Battery life is very good, fast charging via cable only is not an issue for me.  I do not need wireless charging.Screen has poor color saturation.  Colors are dark and muted, not bright at all like the older OnePlus 8 Pro.So far, I am tolerating the phone. I would give it a 3.5...but you cannot give it half numbers, so I am rounding up.","December 21, 2023"

After a little more than 2 months, I was on Instagram scrolling,  them I saw two one inch lines on the screen, I thought it was part of the reel I was watching but swiped up and it was still there. I closed the phone and opened it back up and then the two small lines became one big line, then by the end if the day, it looked like the Pic. The front screen still worked and the phone still worked. The part that sucks is they want it back to verify it's not physical damage. So for two weeks, you don't have a phone. I just called today since it been a week and I haven't heard anything and the lady said they no longer have the black one and asked if I want the green one, I said send what ever I need a phone. Basically the deal breaker here is you need a back up phone if anything happens to your phone,  they want your old phone first. Any other phone company or carrier, you have the insurance and you get new phone in the mail and put your old phone in the mail. When I get the new phone, I will sell it for like $1k and get a phone here with my carrier, that way if something does happen, I won't be out of a phone for 2 weeks. Huge process deal-breaker, I could have kept using that phone until the new one came in. Now I am using my sons phone for 2 weeks until I get mine.","May 17, 2024"

You need TWO HANDS shut off this phone:  Power button plus ""volume up"" at the same time.  Also by ""design"" the ""close all"" function does not close all, but leaves the app you last had open, open.  You then have to swipe the app to get rid of it.  (meaning: if you are watching PORN when your girlfriend walks in, neither the Power Button nor the ""close all"" function will save you - you are toast!  And to top it off, the display swiping automatically opens another useless Google ""feature"".  Seriously though, it simply makes the phone clumsy to use.  Interface is EVERYTHING with  a phone.  I got around the power button problem by installing an app which shuts off the phone, and installed a different Launcher to get rid of that second Google ""feature"".  Also, OnePlus customer service is non-existent, and getting a little ""dodgy"".  Then of course, OnePlus is a high tech manufacturer, so one should expect its customer service to be unreachable, dishonest and lousy.  I have owned five (six?)

"OnePlus Open, 16GB RAM+512GB, Dual-SIM, Voyager Black, US Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone, 4805 mAh Battery, 67W Fast Charging, Hasselblad Camera, 120Hz Fluid Display",Amazon Customer,1.0,"I purchased the OnePlus Open directly from their site. I made the dubious decision after reading great reviews online. I noted the detractors warning against quality control, software issues and support issues, but wrote these things off as an acceptable risk. I knew this was a first gen product and was willing to give it a try. I've done much the same for Microsoft, Samsung and Google, having owned both the Surface Duo, Galaxy Fold 3 and 4, and Pixel Fold.I ordered the device, and made the mistake of performing a trade in of my existing Pixel Fold. I was putting A LOT of trust in this working out. Typically when I try out a new device i just sell my old one on Swappa to recoup costs, but I was lazy this time... and I paid for it.The device felt GREAT in hand. The camera was good, and the multitasking was good enough to overlook the rest of the software. For the first week or so it performed perfectly with no issues, so i sent my old Pixel fold in since i only had 15 days before they would charge me the 1050 trade in value.The next day I noticed my phone was constantly hot and the battery was draining rapidly. So much so that plugging it in while it was on would only halt battery drain and not even charge it. For 2 days I was on track to get roughly 6 hours on a charge regardless of screen on time. I couldn't find a way to get to safe mode, or clear the system cache, so I simply did a factory reset. The problem persisted. I performed another factory rest, and this time didn't sign in. I simply accepted defaults and got to the homescreen. The problem persisted.At this point, I realize the problem is either so deep in the software or in the hardware that I can't trust this device and should return it within my 15 days for a full refund. I triggered a return through email and get a response that the process has been started. 2 days later, nothing. So I call in to start the process. Support tells me there are no pending returns but they can start one. They start the return and inform me that I will get a refund, but not the full trade in value of the phone. I'll lose 500 dollars because the phone is only actually worth 500 and the other 550 was a promotional coupon which is void since i'm returning the phone. What's more, I'll only receive the 500 dollars in a OnePlus store credit and not a refund. WTF?! Support also noted that I can't cancel the trade in, per policy, and they were unwilling to work with me any further.I take responsibility for the decisions that landed me in this position. Boy did my luck run out when I decided to purchase OnePlus, and trade my current phone rather than sell it myself.My experience sucked, but I'm giving this phone 1 star because you're rolling the dice on if you'll get a functioning phone as soon as you buy it, and that's unacceptable for a 1500 dollar device, even during the first gen. Check out the OnePlus subreddit. They have a PSA up warning all buyers against this phone. I wish I had listened.","March 27, 2024"
"OnePlus Open, 16GB RAM+512GB, Dual-SIM, Voyager Black, US Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone, 4805 mAh Battery, 67W Fast Charging, Hasselblad Camera, 120Hz Fluid Display",Amazon Customer,5.0,"It's easy to get hung up on aspects like how waterproof a phone is or whether it has wireless charging, but when you get into the day-to-day usages of a smartphone, that's when you'll identify aspects that really matter.For me, working as a standard phone that has great battery life, a great screen and a strong camera are most important. Having all of that in a form factor that also offers a built in tablet takes this phone from a great flagship device to do much more.The possible negatives: no wireless charging, not waterproof and size. This phone charges so fast with the included charger that wireless charging is not needed. I've been down to 50% battery, plug it in and in about 10-15 minutes it's nearly 100% again. Being able to charge up so fast has reduced the need/feeling of having to charge it up all the time or have wireless charging available. For me, I don't need to go swimming with this phone. I've recognized that for all the benefits I get in the day to day are worth being a bit more mindful of my device and how I treat it. OnePlus had dinner a lot to make the form factor off this foldable great, but it still isn't small. Having a back case and a tempered glass screen protector on the outer screen gives me piece of mind without making it bulky.Neutral: Oxygen OS. Many are used to Samsung or Apple for their operating system. I came from the Galaxy S23 Ultra and don't find myself missing anything. I feel like I've gained some customization and productivity.Positives: the camera, the screens, battery life and build quality. The main camera on this phone has impressed me. I was worried I'd have to compromise on this going to a foldable, but instead, I feel like I'm some cases, it even out performs my S23 Ultra. There's a setting for fast motion, which has been a big plus for catching amazing action shots. The outer screen on this phone is great enough to use it all the time, and makes it feel like opening up the phone to the larger screen is just such a pure bonus. I also didn't want to deal with a big crease in the screen, but Oneplus has designed this phone in a way where it's barely noticable. The battery life is great. I can use this phone for web browsing, social media, games and more throughout the day and find myself with plenty of battery life left at the end of the day. Lastly, the build quality on this device is impressive. OnePlus had always provided a premium build with their devices, and the Open is no exception. Everything feels solid, the speakers are amazing, the cameras work great, the fingerprint reader is flawless and the way it opens and closes feels strong and secure.Overall, this device may not be for everyone, but for anyone wanting a foldable, then I'm comfortable endorsing the OnePlus Open. I've had it for over a month, and a few minor gripes I had have already been addressed with a recent software update. Having had flagship devices over the years, this phone definitely is one and for me, is the first foldable that I don't feel like I have to compromise on flagship features and performance in order to have a foldable.","December 29, 2023"

Then I changed to the Google Pixel Fold. The Pixel Fold was ok but felt like it was twice as heavy as the OnePlus Open. My hand would literally get tired if I was surfing the web on my Pixel Fold. Now I have the OnePlus Open and it is just better in every way. The phone is sooo much lighter, it's thinner, has a faster processor and more storage space. The crease from the fold is way less noticeable on the OnePlus Open than any other foldable. Also, I'm not a big camera geek but the zoom feature on the OnePlus Open is amazing. It's like having a pair of binoculars as a camera. I was tempted to get the Samsung fold 5 but front screen (when folded) is way too skinny for me. I like a phone (when folded) to be normal screen dimensions of a regular large screen phone. The front screen is so good that you find yourself surfing the web on the front screen and have to remind yourself that it opens up to a much larger screen. If you're in the market for a foldable, this is the only way to go...until something better comes out.","January 3, 2024"

"OnePlus Open, 16GB RAM+512GB, Dual-SIM, Voyager Black, US Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone, 4805 mAh Battery, 67W Fast Charging, Hasselblad Camera, 120Hz Fluid Display",Amazon Customer,5.0,"This is my first foray into foldables. I considered the Galaxy Z Fold 5 and said ""NO"" due to the gigantic crease and the extremely narrow outside screen. I seriously considered the pixel Fold due to the well sized outside screen, but once again, said ""NO"" due to the gigantic crease on the inside screen. I almost gave up hope of a decent foldable until the Oneplus Open came out literally 2 days after I gave up on the Pixel Fold. Talk about fortuitous circumstances. The Open checks all of the right boxes for me. The outside screen is wide enough and is the same size as other phones that I have, but am not using. The crease is so minimal that it's almost unnoticeable. It comes in one storage configuration of 512 GB and one memory configuration 16 GB of RAM. It is a beast and the performance is killer. I've heard reports that after 2-4 weeks the crease gets a lot deeper/bigger. I've had mine for a full month going on 5 weeks now and the crease has not changed. Some reviewers on here mentioned how there are bugs and biometrics do not work on here. They must have gotten a bad unit or not know how to turn on biometrics for their apps. I have 4 credit card apps on here among other things that use biometrics and the biometrics works for all of my apps, that use them. Like any flagship device, there are little hiccups and quirks in the phone. There's a reason for that. All operating systems, mobile or otherwise are imperfect, which is why there are updates. If they weren't flawed to some degree, they wouldn't need updates. They would only need security updates. One thing I will mention is the magic erasure on the Pixel 8 Pro. It is a killer piece of software in the camera software that allows you to remove things from pictures you have taken. It comes in very handy. I thought that the Pixel 7 Pro, now 8 Pro were the only phones to have it. I was wrong. The Oneplus Open has it as well and it works just as well as the one on the Pixels. The Open also takes great pictures. The battery life is really nice. With My S22 Ultra and Pixel 7 Pro. I was usually at about 30% by the end of the day. With the Open I'm usually at 60% - 70% by the end of the day. O usually get up at around 6:00 AM and pull my Open off of the charger and then put it back on the charger at around midnight or 1:00 AM. I love it. Also, it charges up in about 60 minutes from empty. I know of no wireless charging that can charge that fast. It even has some software that charges slowly and finishes charging around your normal wake up time, based on your alarms. This puts less stress on the battery. Smart charging, or whatever it is called. The multitasking capabilities beats out the Pixel Fold and in some ways the Galaxy Z Fold 5. The Oneplus Open can have 3 apps open at one  time and you can scroll between them easily. It is really intuitive. The Pixel Fold is seriously lacking in that department. The Samsung Z Fold 5 isn't as good, but in other ways just as good in that department.  This is the best foldable you can get in the United States, right now. It also has an 8 Gen 2 processor and not a Tensor like the Pixel Fold. The only cons are the waterproofing, or lack thereof, I don't plan on swimming with it, and the software updates, which are minimal at best. It does come with a charger and cable, take that Samsung, and all the others that are rude enough to not send a charger with their phones. The price point is still a couple hundred dollars lower than the Z Fold 5 and the Pixel Fold, at the same storage amount. I paid $2,000 for mine, but that included $200 ear buds and a $500 Oneplus Tablet that is a midrange tablet, as well as a 100 Watt VOOC Charger, not the one the phone comes with. All totally worth it. If you do the math, it's not a bad deal at all. Last thing, if you are looking for a foldable with minimal crease, a wide enough outer screen, and is extremely well built with minimal software issues, you won't find better than the Oneplus Open.","December 18, 2023"

The defect is not easily detectable and there's really no effort being done by one plus open to either acknowledged the defects nor any conscious effort to repair them.  Currently building a group of other OnePlus Open customers to file a formal class action lawsuit as OnePlus has seriously failed to address the issue nor to honor its warranties.The current tactic with the OnePlus Open is to intentionally delay their response to reported issues with the phone in order to exhaust the 30-day warranty that comes with it.  A 30-day warranty one should note is very shady to begin with and is usually only offered with equipment that is not going to last past 30 days and that is exactly what happens with the OnePlus open except that for me in two separate occasions the phone developed a black line right where the creases which only increases over time My first attempt to return the phone failed due to the RMA number being invalid or having expired either of which prevented me from getting the phone to the proper facility.if you have a broken OnePlus open phone or a defective OnePlus open phone please contact me or leave a comment below and I will if you want add you to the class action lawsuit which they have been served before by the same law firm.  This law firm has successfully won a previous class action lawsuit against him and it looks like this incident is going to be that lawsuit look like peanuts being paid out because this is an intentionally bad faith sale of a defective product coupled with intentional to bad faith actions to honor their own warranty and insurance offering both of which are on both of these phones both of which are not being honored or even given the opportunity to be reviewed.,"January 30, 2024"

OnePlus 11 5G | 16GB RAM+256GB | Dual-SIM | Eternal Green | US Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone | 5000 mAh battery | 80W Fast charging | Hasselblad Camera | 120Hz Fluid Display | 4nm Processor,Sean,5.0,"I've been an Android enthusiast since the first Android phone was available here, the HTC Dream/Google G1, I've run custom firmware, and tweaked the bejesus out of my devices, so I think I know a thing or two.This phone is absolutely top-notch. High spec hardware that works great, in a beautiful, slickly designed package. The Oneplus 11 will hang with any of the current gen Samsungs or Pixel Pro in just about any way. The camera performance may not test quite as highly as a current Galaxy S Ultra or Pixel Pro, but the cameras are very good and very close! Beautiful screen, blazing fast performance, 16gb RAM, and all the 5G and LTE bands you need for any US carrier, so what's not to like?I've found the battery life to be very good, as I still have at least 50% left when I get home from work. And as for charging, WOW, this thing charges ridiculously fast with the included charger - faster than just about anything else out there, and most phones don't even come with a charger anymore. Igo from 40-50% to full in almost no time. I did turn off the Wise charging feature though because I couldn't figure out how to set it up, and its mystery schedule didn't jibe with my super early wake up time.The lack of wireless charging seems unthinkable for an otherwise incredible flagship-level phone in 2023, and I have no idea why they omitted it. This is unforgivable, although I will say that with the battery life and super fast charging I can get by without wireless. This need not be a deal breaker even if you must have it, since wireless adaptors are all over Amazon for like $12.I have found some negative aspects of this phone, albeit minor ones I can live with. For one, the phone is beautifully designed but very slippery in the hand. You're going to protect your investment with a case anyway though, aren't you? I found a nice clear TPU one that shows it off will protecting it a bit and adding enough grip to make me comfortable. And I do wish the screen was flat rather than curved. I see no benefit to the curved edges, which can cause glare at some angles and lighting conditions, and they make screen protectors and cases a little difficult to engineer perfectly.The fingerprint sensor is my only other gripe. It works, but I have yet to find an under-screen sensor, whether ultrasonic or optical, that works as reliably and quickly as I'd like. Moto nails it with their side-mounted sensor on the power button of some recent phones, and I loved what LG did when the had it in the center of the BACK of their phones. My glass screen protector is probably partially to blame, but the sensor wasn't perfect with the factory-applied TPU cover, either. This has prompted me to finally try face unlock, which Oneplus has done a good job with, admittedly.All in all, I love this phone. It is probably the best Android device I've owned, surpassing even the LG V30 and Samsung s10 5G, which were my favorites in their respective heydays. The Oxygen OS interface isn't as intuitive as stock Android, and some people really don't like recent incarnations of it, but I don't have a problem with it. Full disclosure: the first thing I do with any Android device is install Nova launcher and the same basic setup I've been using for several years, so manufacturers' launchers are irrelevant to me, but Oxygen OS is fine with me otherwise and Oneplus bloatware is minimal.6/5 stars, GREAT phone with very competitive pricing for what you get.","July 24, 2023"
OnePlus 11 5G | 16GB RAM+256GB | Dual-SIM | Eternal Green | US Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone | 5000 mAh battery | 80W Fast charging | Hasselblad Camera | 120Hz Fluid Display | 4nm Processor,Ivan,5.0,"Was very worried whether I could get a provider, because I was with Straight Talk with my last phone and I couldn't find information that Straight Talk worked on this OnePlus 11 phone. I went from an A51 Samsung Galaxy phone to the US Factory OnePlus 11.  I took the Sim card out of the Samsung and put it in the OnePlus 11 and I had service right away.I know I couldn't keep the new phone on the old Sim, so I went to get a new Sim Card, but ended up buying a Simple Mobile SIM card which is a sister company to Straight Talk. Had to call into Simple Mobile to set it up though.  It would not just setup. However, when I called customer service and they sent me codes, they asked me questions, such as ""what is your pin"", etc. and I couldn't answer them because I was not setup with Simple Mobile.  I kept saying I am not getting codes from Simple Mobile and I haven't setup security questions with Simple Mobile.  Later during the conversation I noticed I was getting messages from Straight Talk.  I then found out the same people I was speaking with work for both  Straight Talk and Simple Mobile. So, my codes were in another email address I set up for Straight Talk.  The security questions they asked me that I couldn't answer, were actually the Security Questions I setup in Straight Talk.  Was confusing.Want people to know, I just did not want to order a SIM from Amazon or Straight Talk and wait a few days to get it. That is the only reason I didn't set it up with Straight Talk. The IMIE number did work with Straight Talk. I tried it also with Google Fi and Verizon.  Verizon actually recognized the ESIM as well. So, I was surprised. So, my answer to, ""Will this phone work with Straight Talk?"" Yes it will and it also works with Simple Mobile.I bought the Simple Mobile Bring your Own Phone 4G LTE and 5G Sim Card. It was $1.00.  But they charged me another .55 cents for 911 emergency fee for the Sim Card.  When I signed up with Simple Mobile to be my actual provider, I noticed I am charged again .55 cents for 911 emergency fee?The look is different then what is in the pictures.  It is not a dark green.  In fact it is sort of a light blue green.  It is very nice looking and a wonderful surprise. I would say it is more of a marine blue. Laying down with a clear cover on the back of it. It is a light green/gray color.How fast it charges is amazing.  15 to 20 minutes and it is fully charged. Love it!It was very easy to setup.  I used the Google backup method, by backing up my old phone to Google Drive and then uploading from Google Drive to the new phone.  All my apps were setup automatically. I just had to put in my internet credentials and email credentials and I was all set.One thing I noticed was I couldn't shut the phone off. Apparently you press the power button on the right and have to hold the volumn up on the left at the same time to get the power option to shut it off. I didn't like that...so I went into Settings and went to Additional Settings and went to Power Button Menu and then to the Press and hold the power button menu and checked off the Power Menu instead of the Voice Assistant.Now all I have to do is press the right hand button and hold it and I get the Power off menu.  I did this because everytime I went to power down the phone by using the right power button, the Google Voice Assistant popped up.  Couldn't stand it, so I changed that button to just be Power on and off by doing the above.I know I read previous reviews stating this problem, but I don't think anyone said how to change it. So, this is for people like me, who don't want the google assistant coming up when they are trying to shut their phone off.I will try setting it up with my car next, but I really don't expect any problems. The service has been good so far and am not having any problems with text, voice or data.I didn't like the lock screen clock. It was weird as it separated vertically the hour and the minutes.  I was able to change that by going to Settings, then Wallpapers & Style, then menu option: always on Display and then changing the clock.  There are not a lot of options there.  But, maybe I can download something on Google Play.So, far very happy customer.Update:  Works with Android Auto. Set it up in my car with no problem.  Was tricky as I didn't understand what I was doing. Plugged it into my USB port in the car and plugged the other end of cord to the phone.  Went to menu in car and put on BT Pairing and went to my phone and swiped down to get Bluetooth.  It said available devices and gave me some sort of at numbers and letters that had no sense to it one way or another and I pressed that on the phone and then pressed BT pairing on the car menu and I then saw Car Audio and it asked me if I wanted to pair or accept that, so I pressed yes.  Called someone and it came over my car radio which was perfect.  Make sure car is on when you do all of this and it does say to have it in park.  I don't think it mattered in my case.  I have an older 2015 car and it worked fine.  I got calls in and they also went out.  Perfect!  The google mapping worked perfectly on my phone giving me direction by direction.Bought a second US Factory OnePlus 11 5GB for my husband and setup Android Auto and it gives us google mapping on his car dashboard with no problems.","November 15, 2023"

However it lacked the bookmarks of my preferred browser.i like the way it manages the battery usage, notifies me when an app is using too much and sends me to the settings to tweek its permission and usage the phone / system Shuts down apps that have not been used in a few months and removing permissions. I am not sure if it is the new version of android but, it is keeping things  controlled instead of snowballing into a big mess that is hard to resolve later and running the devise into  high inefficiency.as for charging it is  screaming  fast. it has a setting that will take its time also  I believe it is good to avoid  baking the battery every time  you charge. and there are several times i have gone 2 days of use before running the battery low.as for the camera. i love the interface and the optical quality for a cell phone is astounding. even zoomed in the pictures maintain a fair level of quality. as opposed to my past phones that would zoom  but produced images that resembled impressionist paintings.  the portraits of people  and snapshots of random things always please. I cannot wait till the northern lights are visible here in the Alaskan skies.I will however retain my dslr equipment for  the money shots....I caught this on sale for $699 which is the most i have paid for a cell phone  ever.I love the freedom I have from the control of the famous fruit company phone, and the huge cost they sell their new model for... ouchfor me it was a big step up from the Blu phones, which I last bought the  F91 5G is no slouch  the camera couldnt do well in low light, but to its advantage it was fast,  and i have a 512GB Mico SD  on top of the 256 internal.  at $199 (Sale price )  but the camera sucked. so i GEEKED out and use both  cell phones for different uses.Thats all I can say for now.all the best to you and good luck","September 6, 2023"

Oh and also the long security update promise of 5 years compared to some phones running only for 2 years.Some of the things I wish this phone had though are putting the fingerprint reader on the back, and having the volume button not be directly across from power (because down volume tends to have me press the power as well to open the shutdown context), and then there's the bug I experienced with the alarm function. When the alarm rings on my phone and I close the notification, there doesn't seem to be a way to shut it off except by force closing the clock app.Overall, I enjoy the phone I picked and don't regret it but I do hope OnePlus continues improving the software side of things.","March 9, 2024"

I really wanted to purchase the Galaxy S23 Ultra, but out of my price range right now.  This phone has the same CPU and more RAM and higher resolution screen.  I've only had this phone two days and I'm still on the first charge at 72%!!  I've never had a phone charge last that long with normal use.  The screen on this One Plus 11 is gorgeous.  Clear and sharp.  There are tons of settings that help increase battery life too.Very impressed with 5G performance.  I live in small rural town in East TN using T-Mobile service.  All I had to do was insert my T-Mobile SIM card and turn it on. Using Ookla Speedtest app,  I am getting 533mbps download on 5G.  Even my Spectrum cable internet isn't that fast!  The OnePlus also has WIFI 7.  I only have WIFI 6 at the moment at home.  The phone connects to my wifi at full speed.Love the cameras too.  Not the 200MP of the S23 Ultra, but the One Plus 50MP main camera is still impressive and it has 48MP wide angle and 32MP telephoto.  It also automatically switches to macro.  Scanning barcodes is very quick.  My previous Pixel 6 usually had a focus issue when taking pics up close. I'm still experimenting with camera settings and features.  I really wanted something with a 'pro' setting.  I have a professional Sony camera and sometime miss having the control.  Most phone cameras do a OK job with point n shoot.  But sometimes are too blue or green for my taste.  I can edit in my PC, but much easier to do that adjustment before you take the image.  Granted phone cameras still can't compare to a professional camera, but this One Plus 11 with the Hasselblad 3rd gen camera for mobile comes close.Also surprised this phone comes with its own charger.  Battery Health Engine improves health and longevity, while still delivering ultra-fast charging speeds with 80W SUPERVOOC.  Thought that was just marketing hype, but the charging brick does seem to be heavier than most chargers.  If I had to complain, the included cable is fairly short.  I prefer 6.5 to 8ft.  Not sure if the 'red cable' is special, but will see if I can purchase a longer one.  So far very impressed with battery life as I pointed out earlier.Seems like phones are shrinking. Although it is suppose to be 6.7"" screen, this phone seems small to me.  I'm an older guy with small hands and still find this phone 'skinny'.  I know they can't please everyone though. I just like something I grab more securely.  It doesn't come with a case. Fortunately, there are many different cases on Amazon available.  Simple silicon cases to heavier duty military grade.  Hopefully the case I ordered will add some gripping width.So far I love this phone and highly recommend it if you can't afford the other flag ship phones.","December 3, 2023"

After 3T I acquired a 7T that in fact my daughter still uses, for this reason I decided to purchase this Oneplus 11 5G. Since that day my disappointment with the brand has increased to the point of hating it. I first bought the phone and after a few days of using it, the screen broke in my pocket. Since the warranty does not cover this type of damage, I had to pay about 200 dollars for its repair. A few days after receiving it repaired, an OFFICIAL software update damaged the OST and I had to send it back for repair. When I sent the phone it was in perfect condition but it turns out that the back part arrived broken and I had to pay just over 100 dollars for the repair. The phone should never have gone for repair in the first place because of them.  I've already spent more than $300 on repairs (almost half of what the phone cost). I never thought I would receive such mediocre service and an equally mediocre cell phone. In my life I will buy Oneplus again, please stay away from that brand since it does not have the quality it used to.","July 22, 2024"

It's always done when I check its progess. That fast charging system is mindblowing. Not only that, but the battery stays charged way longer than any cell phone I've owned. The battery and cameras are ideal; no need at all to improve those. The rest of the phone is just as good.It's as perfect a cell phone money can buy, in my opinion.","August 8, 2024"
OnePlus 11 5G | 16GB RAM+256GB | Dual-SIM | Eternal Green | US Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone | 5000 mAh battery | 80W Fast charging | Hasselblad Camera | 120Hz Fluid Display | 4nm Processor,Ivan,5.0,"First off, a little background: I come from a previous line of Samsung phones. I have an iPhone for work, and am forced to use it.That said, I was looking to upgrade from my S20FE due to the device pushing 4 years old. I toyed around with the S23ultra and although the camera is pretty sweet, I couldn't justify all that extra money for a feature that isn't a core function of the telephone. What was left in the price range I wanted to stay in, was the Pixel 7 Pro, and this OnePlus 11 5G.  I opted to purchase the OnePlus with the 16gb of ram version, and I cannot complain at all about it. (I use Straight Talk's service btw, and it has better reception than the S20FE had.There are a couple small idiosyncrasies in this phone's UI that just ""feel"" odd, but I think it feels that way because I have become accustomed to Samsung's UI as being standard.Other than the very minor quirks that are normal for Oxygen OS, I have found NOTHING disappointing about this phone. The camera is absolutely fantastic, except the selfie camera takes ""colder"" looking pictures.Easy fix: install the gCam port.Now I use gCam for selfies, and the stock app for everything else.The charging rate of this phone is downright staggering in comparison to any iphone or Samsung or Google product, hands down.Also, it ACTUALLY CONES WITH A CHARGER. None of the flagships from the previous three manufacturers include even a crappy charger, let alone one that pushes EIGHTY WATTS🤯So do yourself a favor and compare this phone to the pricetag of any phone with a Snapdragon 8 gen2 processor, and also factor in the fact that it has 16 GB of ram, and it's no wonder the phone is so crazy fast and smooth. Go look up a 256gb S23ultra, then look for the 16gb ram option. There isn't one. Same chipset albeit an over locked version, but ""only"" 12gb of ram available. Couple that with the $1,100 pricetag, slow charging speed, no charger in the box, and now you'll see why the OnePlus 11 is such a huge value for your money. Did I mention OnePlus is now offering FOUR YEARS of Android updates? This this will be good through Android 17!!Honestly, it was a tough call between this and the Pixel 7 Pro because of the telephoto lens on the 7pro. But, the Tensor chipset is not exactly the most powerful thing on the block and struggles if put up against a serious gaming session. Also saw lots of reports where the rear camera glass was brittle and breaking during normal use, and Google wasn't covering it under warranty.This phone is the clear value champion of 2023.","April 24, 2023"

Unlike their phones as of late sadly.While omeplus does care for its customers. They are.... Very incompetent. And are not doing a good job at listening to the community.As for tech support and repair wise? They do it amazingly.If you wanna get a OnePlus phone go for the Nord 3 it has the same CPU in the OnePlus Pad and that thing never heats up. So the Nord 3 is bound to have much better temperature control.Old review I regret making:Summary:16 gigs ram an apu that seldom heats up (snapdragon 8 gen 2)a great UI and os (oxygen os in my case as this listing is an international/us model) is 800$ and not overpriced.Not one to bother about camera quality as It doesn't matter these days as everything can take decent to amazing screenshots as long as it's 150$ and above.Pros:A phone that seldom heats up and can run anything at max without breaking a sweatA phone company that seems to care about their customers (thank God.)4 years of guaranteed os updates and 5-year sec updates at minimum.16 gig ram 256 storage with a very optimized and energy efficient APU (and current the most powerful phone apu as of May 8th 2023 (snapdragon 8 gen 2) for 800$(samsung asks for 1000$ for the same apu but slightly overlocked thus making more heat with 8 gig ram 128 storage. apple has a apu around the same power but only has 6 gigs of ram and asks 1400$. google asks for 700$ for 12 gig ram 256 storage and their apu that is about half as powerful as motorola their moto edge+ 2023 has 8 gigs of ram same price as this and has stock android.)Great os (oxygen os in this case as it is an international/us model)Game tools to increase quality/performance  (samsung has it as well but oneplus's version has more options.)A LTPO3 Fluid AMOLED display that can easily look more vibrant than a ips LCD if set on pro mode. (I use max cool color temp personally) No opinion:camera systems on everything over 150$ have good cameras these days.Cons:Glass back. Makes the phone hard to grip onto and caseless and it makes it slide everywhere till May 16-25th it's the 6th rn as of this edit. Seriously just put a thin plastic optionally tearable covering in the back. The tpu screen protector that comes on the phone should honestly be put on the back instead for grip.The curved screen is bad as it's almost impossible to get a screen protector on. and it also is easier to break from a fall. Can't have battery saver on when updating When in landscape and inside a game the notifications don't appear as normal and are a small one-line only. And I want the game tools they have so I have to deal with this, unfortunately.Personal cons:On-screen fingerprint sensor, used to the more accurate side-mounted ones. Plus sometimes screen protectors have annoying holes in them for the sensor.6.7 inches instead of 6.8 why you might ask? Well. The past 2 phones I had, a s22 I returned. (Samsung screwed me and didn't want me as a customer.) And a moto edge 5g UW 2021 were both 6.8 and they could have made the battery in the OnePlus 11 5100 milliamp instead of the 5000 if they did make the phone 6.8 inches. But that's just me. Final notes: If your gonna get a flagship Android phone that you want to last at least 2 or more years then get this if you want an OEM Android.As the pros far outweigh the cons. If you want stock Android go for a pixel or the 800$ moto edge+ 2023 or unlock the boot loader on this thing but I don't recommend that.","May 5, 2023"

Find myself in low battery I plug it in and after 20-25 mins it's done.. I have gotten with 40 percent of battery and still happy. Am.a heavy user and just 1 charge and good. With that 40 percent by the time I get home which is 6 hrs later I still have juice..what I dislike is the camera.. it's not bad by any means... But other phones even cheap can automatically focus.. while this phone that was worth 800. Can't🫤🫤speakers are nice and loud... Brightness isn't bright when it comes to very harsh sunlight 90+ in the heat in Florida. Not even medium brightness helps very dim. And full brightness it's ok but not as bright as let's say the iPhone 15. Reason I know a family has it not sure able the model. But it's brighter and actually can see the screen better from the brightness. But another thing I really love is the connection with devices... One car I owe refuses to lower the volume by phone. While this one at times it works and can lower and bump up the music.. finger print is a 6-10. Hyped up ... Maybe I haven't used it correctly. But use a screen protector and doesn't seem to scan. Had a privacy screen very thin. And it isn't your normal screen protector your thinking of. It's like wobbly flimsy. And wasn't able to scan. And it's hard to find screen protector with this phone.. and seriously don't waste your money.. if you want this phone go for the 12 plus. I was 1 month or weeks before the new one came out😭😭😭😂 but do I think its horrible no.. it does what it needs to do for heavy users . Never have I came across any bugs.. or virus. Am very impressed on how I use it and I have proof.. still 100 percent . And one million dollar tip... USE ORIGINAL CHARGING CABLE. No matter what it is. iPhone android.. you welcome. And yes I love the color of this phone. People have asked what it is and like how it looks. Multiple tasking is also great like that alot. And the cable and brick it came with is legit. It is the biggest reason I even wanted the phone. And I plan to have this phone for at least 4-5 yrs before I even touch another phone.,"March 23, 2024"

This is my first flagship phone and I chose the OnePlus 11. One feature that might not effect everyone like it does me is when your completely emersed in an app such as gaming or shopping and you get a call, answering the call doesn't teleport you to the call screen. You stay right where you are and never miss a beat. That's just a little thing I love but it's also full of big things like response time! Connection speed! Charging speed!!! The feel of this phone is just pristine. Everything is quick there's floating windows and the oh so perfect everytime finger print scanner which is under the display. No buttons! It hasn't failed to read my finger once. I saw a review saying the opposite but I've had zero trouble. My son even said it's probably not evening reading your finger just letting you in...so he tried his finger and couldn't get it to open lol. I love the camera it really takes true to life pictures. It also does this thing with the screen when your trying to take a pic of something with writing on it. Like it clears up the writing so you can take a clear legible picture of the writing or document. It also has screen recording that also will record your camera view at the same time if you so desire. It's really great with personalized settings too. The theme and icon personalizations are amazing. There's probably a lot more I'm not keen to yet but that's what I can think of. Happy shopping!******Update*********5 months laterI still can't get enough of this phone. This is how a phone should be! Responding quick, no worrying about space, pull out the camera instantly with 2 clicks from power button, amazing pictures and video(I have only bad experience with photos in past phones so my comparison/opinion might differ from yours) and the 27 min to full charge is just SO FREAKING CONVENIENT! The sound is loud enough you don't struggle to know ""is that MY phone going off?"" It connects to EVERYTHING EFFORTLESSLY! Tap to pay is a breeze no more (is it right here or... this way...) holding my phone like a puzzle piece trying to get the right angle to pay for things anymore! Pay at the pump, get cash at ATM buying groceries just whip out my phone, bam bam bam, DONE! I CAN'T EXPRESS ENOUGH, I LOVE THIS PHONE!PS my finger print scanner is great! I saw other reviews staying other wise but I never have problems. My screen protector is not tempered glass just in case that has anything to do with it. It's just like the one that came in the screen to begin with. YEAH, IT CAME WITH ONE! LOVE IT!","August 28, 2023"

They removed that, totally gone. Now when you slide to the left you get google news, with no solid way of removing it and if you do disable it, there is no left pane. There is a widget shelf of sorts but it only holds 6 things and only useless apps. So now you have to use more screen space for widgets. And the widget sizes are limited so they have to be very big or very small.The phone is plenty fast, but they dumbed it down. Before I could long press an icon, see its widget and install. Now you can't. Before you could long press the widget and reset  it or restart it, now you can't. Before you could use an index to find stuff in long lists, now you can't.The camera, dumb. It has 2 modes - 12mp, 50mp. Nothing in between. So its either a 4mb file or a 20mb file, with no say 20mp in the middle. There are 3 lenses - no zoom. A wide angle, a normal and a 2x, its not a zoom, its just another lens. And when you get too close to something it switches to macro. Which is fine, but macro is a different lens, and so the viewpoint changes with it. Its like when you hold your finger in front of your face and open and close each eye and it jumps around.Its also hard to hold horizontally because they stupidly put the lens right where your finger goes.Beyond that its a good phone, it could really use a camera software update and I really want my widget shelf back. Oh and do get a case, this thing is super hard to hold. The edges are active and you constantly press stuff. Its hard to hold and your hand migrates to the old part of the phone with grip and that's the camera lens. The black phone feels like plastic and doesn't give you grip.It does come with a nicely applied plastic cover but it scratches and gouges easily.","October 22, 2023"

I am an owner of the Samsung S23 Ultra, which is a decidedly wonderful phone, but what I really love about this phone is the little things that Samsung does not do! To be honest I have had OnePlus phones in the past and I was thoroughly satisfied with them. I bought the Samsung S23 Ultra because I got a great deal on the storage upgrade, like the same price for the 512 GB as for the 256 GB, in which trade in from my old S22 I ended up paying only a few hundred dollars.With this phone (OnePlus 11) s's et up was incredibly easy and quick and I have over 120 apps on my phone! It just went so quickly that I had to keep checking to be sure it was actually working. The call quality is unbelievably good. Even when connecting it to my Wi-Fi, it went so quickly that it was scary!Now as for the camera quality. Like most people, I do not buy a smartphone just to take pictures and videos and I am certainly not Frederico Fellini. The picture quality is excellent even in close-ups and in darker situations. I think a lot of people even professional reviewers when it comes to cell phones have gotten just so picky and nitpicky that they miss the major points of whether or not it is just a device, because there's always a ""but""!People are sticking to the point that this phone only has an IP64 rating versus an IP67 or 68 rating. This phone does well in splash situations or rain, versus being able to submerge the phone like most people decide to stick a $1000 cell phone underwater to take pictures of fish anyway! It's a bogus point! Besides there are cases you can buy, waterproof cases, that can handle this if you do decide to go deep sea diving with your phone or are worried about it getting wet and falling out of your pocket in a pool or in the ocean. It's just a nonstarter for an issue.People also complained that it doesn't do wireless charging. With the charger, it comes with this thing and the ability to go from 0 to 100 in literally a matter of minutes who gives a damn about a wireless charger when you can easily put this charger/adapter in your pocket and use it anywhere there is electricity! Again another bogus point!For the price, simply put, this is an outstanding phone and it is clear I should have gotten this one instead of the S23 Ultra because from my viewpoint they are both equally as good.I'm loving it!","May 30, 2023"

The charging profile is some next level stuff.  I started charging it when the battery was @ 25% and some 5 minutes later it's reporting that it's at 45%.  Good stuff there.  Considering that it's a performance product I am still working on configuration to get more battery life out of it between charges.My biggest issue is finding a front screen protector product.  This phone has the curved display and I'm still going through various brands of protective film that will stick to the curved parts.  I know that it has the tempered glass but with the dolby vision I really don't want to have the front screen scratched.  The app management system is pretty intelligent and will shutdown apps that are running in the background to save on battery life.OnePlus Oxygen OS is really good as well.  OnePlus also provides support through 4 system updates (it shipped with android 13) and all security related patches.I went with an unlocked international version because having the flexibility to go to a different cell service provider that gives me options.  It also comes with 2 sim card slots so if I travel outside the USA, all I have to do is purchase a sim card / service and I'm back in business.Considering that all mobile devices I've owned in the past have only been changed out at year 4 or 5 on a annual basis that makes this even more attractive for the performance that it delivers.  I am not going to go over all the specs here, Oneplus has that already.Definitely recommend.","December 16, 2023"

When charging, the S23 took about 1.1/2 hour and was still not 80% using a MacBook charger. The OP11 charge time is around 25 min to 100%!!When taking a random pic of my living room  using both phones, - I thought something might be wrong with the S23 in comparison (not kidding). I'm not a camera/ telephoto freak, so the crazy camera abilities touted on S23 are lost on me.The OP11 UI is attractive and exciting making the S23s seem utilitarian. No heat issues, quality seems impeccable, performance all outstanding on both phone. I have queried OP support on one issue, the ability to turn on/ off Airplane/ Bluetooth modes with the screen locked. They responded within two days as promised. Even if someone were to steal and turn on Airplane mode the phone is useless to them, also ""Find My Device"" will record the phones location the moment Airplane mode is switched off..My only REAL misgivings are the auto brightness (way too dim), and the outdoor brightness (not quite enough - for me).The  S23 w/ 512g storage/ 12g memory $1400, the OnePlus11 w/ 256g/ 16g memory  $649!!Having said all of this, - because of the brightness issue alone (the most important criteria to me, along with battery and charging time), I am going wait until FEB/ MARCH of 2024 when the OP12 is released, as it addresses the brightness issue (from 1350 nitts to over 2000 nitts, the S23 is 1750 nitts and S24 purportedly around 2500 nitts).Certainly the price will go up - for both phones.Obviously these are my findings and opinions.UPDATE: I kept it! - I just couldn't send it back. The S23U is my phone, but at home this is all I use. After lot's of research, MY ONLY MISGIVING with this phone are the ""attempted"" repair horror stories. Parts seem to be impossible to obtain, and on OP site I cannot locate an auth repair center in California.","September 26, 2023"

My needs changed so I picked up a Samsung habit and ATT was happy to feed me unlimited.I'm 65 and retired now so my needs have changed. My Note 10 plus works well but is dated and Samsung no longer provides support. I like to solve problems before they occur so I started researching a new phone a year ago. So many choices most of them good, but expensive out of pocket. Carriers are happy to help you get one so you can take on 30 months of high profit plans.This phone has a lot of good reviews and rightly so. Samsung S23 Ultra is awesome and really way more than I need at $1200.00.This is $800.00 and after a day can't find a flaw in fact it too is awesome.Blazing fast. Battery last. Long time. Recharges very fast. I never used wireless charging before so don't care this doesn't have it.The speakers are more than adequate that too I don't care about so much because I stream via Bluetooth.The camera I haven't used yet but I see it has dual camera mode for those that want to vlog in 8k. That is a big thing with reviewers and maybe me. I got rid of my DSLR because it's huge and went to Canon G7Xll which at 20 megapixels takes great photos. The Samung took great photos. This will take great photos.Audiophiles exist that study the nuance of every note. I'm not that guy. Saturation etc in photos isn't going to bother me much and I guess if it did editing will come in handy. They say the best camera is the one you have with you and this is it.Spend $800.00 for this phone/mini computer and it will get you through 5 years at least unless like a magpie you're attracted to shiny new things. Like me put a sim card in and you're ready to go. I live in Mexico now and use Telcel at $10.00 a month. Or spend $80.00 a month for the next three years for virtually the same thing here. This also has an esim which I haven't worked out yet. Doesn't look like Mint mobile recognizes this model yet.","July 12, 2023"

Performance wise this phone is a workstation. However, it's shortcomings are found with its lack of reliability. One night I didn't charge my phone and the battery went below 10%, so it turned on some power saving features (possibly shutting down communications). Upon fully charging my phone and attempting to use it I realized I didn't have any signal so none of my text messages or calls were coming in, I had to switch devices while sorting this out (it took days). I tried every method I could find online to fix it, but no luck. My last resort was to disconnect the battery, AKA remove the glass back which shatters easily. Disconnecting the battery and reconnecting it work. Fast forward a few months later everything seems fine and this time I find myself watching YouTube and a WhatsApp notification comes in. I reply to the notification through the notification window while simultaneously watching YouTube, something I do all the time, and after replying to that message the phone freezes. I tried holding the power button, but it will not shut off, I try holding the volume up button plus the power button for over 10 seconds, and it doesn't shut off, so I try holding the volume down button plus the power button and it will not shut off. Ultimately I had to remove the glass back again and disconnect the battery. I have purchased a replacement glass back because it is shattered by this point, however, I lost confidence in this phone's reliability and I feel that I'm going to have to remove the battery again at some point, so I am refraining from installing the glass back. As for the specifications the phone is fast the Snapdragon is top notch and 16 gigs of RAM make it feel like you can do anything, these specs would be great for a tablet but the lack of reliability is stopping me from giving it five stars.","February 2, 2024"

I love the easy customization of Android system and seamless synchronization with PC Windows and my Google suite (I am a heavy PC and Google app user).  And my smart home is Google based which works better with Android. But I hate the fact that Android phone/system gets sluggish after a while.  I hate everything about iPhone but I do think iPhone/iOS has better optimization and provides a smoother experience.OnePlus 11 5G is a great Android phone and I have yet to find any main shortcomings. It is slick, fast, powerful and has a lot of features.  It accepts both fingerprint and facial recognition, which is very convenient.  The screen looks amazing. The color is vivid. The camera is top-notch. Since it's Android, it supports all kinds of audio codecs. I am able to listen to music at either LDAC or aptX quality on my bluetooth headphones while iPhone will restrict me to AAC.  I am also a business person who travels often in different parts of the world and needs to switch sim card.  The dual sim card slots make my life a lot easier.  There are several useful features built in the operating system such as split screen, floating screen etc., making working on my phone a lot easier.The fast charging is great. A full charge can last a whole day without any issue. This is amazing considering that I am a heavy phone user. However, I wish it was equipped with wireless charging.  This may be the only shortcoming I found so far.Overall I am very happy with this phone so far.  Great job, OnePlus!  I just hope that OnePlus won't be banned by the US government again one day like what they did to Huawei since OnePlus is also a Chinese company.","September 17, 2023"

Performs well. I like hoe it looks and performs. But I do have an issue. I hate putting cases on phones. I like a sleek, thin phone that slips right in a pocket. But the back panel of this phone is made with a very slick polymer that makes it impossible to hold in on hand.  You are either fighting to keep a grip or accidentally activating something. On the curve edged screen. So the answer is a pop up gripper on the back, right?  Wrong. Those will not adhere to the back of the phone. Nothing sticks to it including Gorilla Tape. I wish I could have this phone with a glass or smooth, glossy back on it. I had to buy a case for this one.","January 8, 2024"

Ma,5.0,I love OnePlus. Have used since the OnePlus 6 and changing devices is so easy. Easy phone clone so set up is seamless and that is a big reason to stick with them. No wireless charging might hurt some but it doesn't bother me. I don't take a lot of pictures but I am happy with basic photos. If you need small details like off color details on white paint it is hard to pick up. Too pictures of a room for rent and it was hard to make out defects you can see with your eyes. Maybe it's a setting but I don't know how to adjust it. Everything else is perfect and it is fast. Games run good and I can have hundreds of tabs open with no issues. I am sure the 12 is amazing but if this is on discount and you need an upgrade pick it up.,"April 5, 2024"

Hands down better than the ultras and pros on the market. Biggest selling point: full charge in 20-25 min. SD 8 gen 2 processor is blazing fast. The camera housing looks great and takes great photos. It probably won't beat pixel or s23 lineup but it takes great pics for its price and everything else it offers. The battery at 5000 mah lasts all day and if you forget to charge it overnight, it can charge while you get ready. 5-10 min and you're getting enough for the day  Samsung, Google, and Apple can't say that. I had a P7 and even though I liked the software and haptics, the slow charging was a deal breaker for me. OxygenOS is pretty great. Has loads of customization and OnePlus doesn't use as much bloatware as Samsung so it's probably the best android skin out there. It has great customization options and has nifty features like a screen off button (not double tap but in the drop-down menu), 3 finger screenshot, scrolling screenshot if you want the whole page, quick launch storage and calculator, etc.The phone is definitely my favorite OnePlus phone so far. That alert slider is handy too although I usually have it on vibrate so I don't use it often! Oh, and face and fingerprint unlock are so fast and accurate, even with a screen protector on. Dual speakers so it gets loud. The volume rocker and power button are on different sides so it's easy to differentiate the buttons unlike Samsung or Google. I included a few photos so you can see what it looks like. The case is Suknap and is the best case I've tried. Lastly, 80w charger in the box. Talk about the value king of 2023. OnePlus, keep it up!I love the OnePlus 11, definitely my daily driver.","April 30, 2023"

And I didn't like ANY of them.They had better cameras for sure. Especially the iPhone was my favorite, but I hated using most of them. The s22 and pixel 7 pro were awful to hold, it felt like I held a brick all day. I use nova launcher and pie control for more efficient navigation and the pixel had issues that made it difficult to use. Oh also, the fingerprint reader was so bad and unreliable. Sony Xperia was a cool experience, but overall I didn't like it, iPhone I kept and use but just as a ""pro camera"" and s22 I returned in a heartbeat.Now, the oneplus I can't stop holding and using. Even before I transferred everything over and had the Sim card in, I used it just to open it and see the beautiful screen and the fluidity of the OS. The camera is OK. I'm a professional photographer so can be picky with pics. The iPhone 14 has a phenomenal camera, oneplus 11 has a camera that can take some great shots, just not all the time. There's been some I've been surprised and impressed and others that were just mediocre. I almost got the 10 pro last year and I'm so glad I waited, none of them Felt right until this one. I love this phone. Beautiful screen, super fast, decent camera, OH RIGHT the charging is also insanely fast! Another great thing. I want to add, there has been some pictures that look REALLY good. Some looked like I took from my dslr, like super good, but it's not all the time, the lighting has to be right(I do wish it had some features thats exclusive to the pixel tho)","February 20, 2023"

I had the original OnePlus One, 2, 6, 6T, 7 Pro McLaren Edition & then I went to other brands eventually ending up with a Pixel 6 Pro, 7 Pro & I was getting the new phone itch again & started looking around. That's when I noticed somehow the glass in one spot over a lens on the back had broken & I never break phones. I had been reading about how much better the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 was over the Google Tensor G2, not only that, but my Pixel 7 Pro had 12GB RAM & 128GB storage. I went with the OnePlus 11 5G 16GB RAM & 256GB storage. It was actually a little cheaper than the Pixel 7 Pro was & honestly I'm shocked at how much of a superior phone it is as well! The screen is absolutely gorgeous QHD+ HDR10+ Dolby Vision! It even supports Ray Tracing in games which is crazy! The audio is unreal! Not only does is have Dolby Atmos, it also has Spatial Audio which is 360 degree sound & if your headphones support it will even auto adjust the sound scape to the orientation of your head! It is extremely fast, surprisingly faster than the Pixel 7 Pro! I have always liked Google phones for the latest updates as they're released, the pure Android experience & since the switch to their own SoC the Tensor G1 & then the G2 the AI features are incredible. Even with all that, I think I'm sticking with OnePlus from now on, because I am beyond impressed!","July 27, 2023"

This was great because I'm not usually the kind of person who's big into the aesthetics. The only knock to that is the cameras take up such a big part of the phone and are pretty exposed. Kinda looks funky to me, but that's kinda how most phones are going. Because they are so exposed, they will definitely need extra protection there, which is difficult right now because the phone is so new and case choices are extremely limited or for preorder. This is also true at the moment for screen protectors. The weight of the phone is very pleasing as well, not too heavy but feels higher quality.The phone is obviously a beast hardware-wise and the cameras are great for a general user, but are absolutely not top of the line (but close). You can also set upto an additional 12gb of unused space for additional virtual RAM if you want even more speed.Another important thing is the phone is super slippery and hard to hold safely, especially with one hand. So again a good case will be definitely required unless you like smacking yourself in the face at night with it while lying down.Also keep in mind, no wireless charging, which isn't important for me, but if it is for you then keep that in mind. The battery otherwise it's nuts and barely moving. It charged from 20% to full before I even finished moving over my stuff from my old phone (one plus 7 lol), which btw was seamless and took about 20 minutes for ~30gb of data via the old cable.The main reason for losing two stars is that the One Plus launcher keeps freezing and locking up even after fully updating the phone and multiple restarts. Maybe I don't know the technology well, but I have to use the default system launcher and even then it's extremely buggy. The One Plus launcher still trys to turn itself on, so even though I have the other launcher set to default it breaks and freezes the whole phone every few minutes.All in all the phone is obviously still new, so we'll see how it develops. But for what you pay you get a killer phone able to compete with the big guys on *most* fronts and still save a couple hundred bucks.Assuming the UI bugs get fixed soon, I'd def give it 4.5-5 stars initially pending more usage.Edit 3/17: ended up returning it and removing a star. Not sure id recommend it anymore. Constantly buggy and getting worse. My battery immediately started draining crazy fast and would barely last one day. My calls started bugging out too and I had to reset my phone way too often just to make and take calls. Again, I want to give it more stars, I probably shouldn't even give it 2 stars but here we are. If you are in a slightly more remote area then I'd definitely stay away from this one. My old OnePlus 7 pro has better reception than this thing...","February 21, 2023"

The 9 was eh, and 10 was a little better then that.  The 11, this 11 is so much more.  First it feels great in the hand wether you get the glossy green back or the textured moon dust black.  The screen is easy to see in daylight, super fast refresh!, and responsive to touch.  The curved edges sometimes pick up a touch but rarely. Look and feel is so on point. Since it isn't being sold through a major carrier Amazon offered a 0% option of 5 monthly payments automatically deducted through my payment of choice.  I love this option for a phone. 1. Paying cash not credit rates.  2. Paid off in less then a year so if something happens or you want to upgrade there is no contract terms to figure out. 3. Worth every penny without raising the costs.Overall this was a great comeback for OnePlus.  A high end performer, stunner, that is easy to purchase without getting tangled in your cell plan.  Syncing from my iPhone 13 was pretty easy too.","October 22, 2023"

Screen is pretty vibrant and bright enough. The camera takes good photos in most situations. Performance is fast and charging is incredibly fast. You wouldn't regret owning this phoneNow I have both this and the s23u and I can tell you the s23U is either a little bit better or much better than the OnePlus 11 in everything except charging.The s23U's screen is much more sharper, better dynamic range and brighter. The colors are more accurate.The camera processing is better. It handles poor lightning conditions better. The images are more detailed and sharper. The self camera is better in every way than i on the OnePlus 11.

The hardware is top notch!  great screen, super fast, super responsive. Long battery life, quick charging, fits in my wrench pocket on my carpenter pants.  I like that they provided a screen protector even though it wants to peel off.  It is fun for me to smash it back down and work the bubbles out.Now for the bad news.The software sucks.  Sucks, sucks, sucks!  I hate it, it frustrates the hell out of me.I should document all of my gipes but I don't want to waste my time.  Trust me, the software sucks.  Here is the one that gets me the most.Some numbnuts put the fingerprint reader right in the middle of the lower half of the screen.  Fine maybe - I don't know.  But they weren't smart enough to write the software such that you can't activate the button under the fingerprint reader once the screen unlocks.  So... you unlock the screen and unless you remove your finger within the 1 zillionth of a millisecond after unlock but before wake up you also press the button under your finger.  So you open up whatever app (I moved all of my apps away from that area) or you pause your music, or start it or whatever because coincidentally the start/stop button for amazon music is RIGHT THERE!  OMG it makes me so mad to unlock the screen and immediately also pause my music.  yeah yeah I know...  Use face unlock.  I do - but frequently that is less convenient.  I know it seems like a 1st world problem, but I'm telling you it is the tip of the software bug iceberg.  If I wasn't into this POS for $600 I'd throw it way.  Seems like I'm stuck with this until Verizon offers a trade in on anything other than OnePlus.Okay, one more since I brought up face unlock...  The button layout is terrible.  To face unlock you need to press the power button.  Well, the volume button is exactly opposite.  so you squeeze power and almost always also squeeze volume up and do you know what you get?  A screen shot of your lock screen.  Super useful.  You could do fingerprint, but that makes me much madder.","January 13, 2024"

I was a diehard Samsung Galaxy fan until this phone showed up at my house in a simple red box with little on it other than the number 11.I always watch reviews, guides and tips and tricks videos before I make a major technology purchase and this phone was no different but even after a few hours of hearing trusted technology advisors telling me this was a true flagship phone, I was still taken aback by the incredible value this phone is at this unheard of price point.Copying my S22 Ultra contents over to the 11 was pretty easy with the OnePlus Clone Phone app and it was fast.I've yet to through an app or game at this phone that it hasn't crushed and the 5G connectivity is a step above anything that I'm used to.The sidebar that I came to love on my Galaxy phones is not only here, it's easier to use and customize than it was on those phones.I can't find anything bad to say about the OnePlus 11 Pro, it's just one of those very rare times when ""Wow!"" accurately conveys the correct sentiment.","June 16, 2023"

Similar to the price of my old phone.Usable amount of RAM. My 2019 phone has 12.Great battery. 5000mAh should be standard.Pinhole notch. Unlike the 14Pro cringe 5head.Fast charging.

Verizon is pushing this hard and it's absurdly fast. Also absurdly bad at penetrating buildings so I don't ever get it on the 14Pro unless I'm bathing in radiation under a tower. But come on, you put the 8gen2 but not mmWave? I'm still getting 350Mbps down on UWB but I don't know how future-proof it is.ColorOS is kinda cringe. Have to relearn the gestures since they aren't 1:1 to Sammy. I just don't get the need to reinvent the wheel with OS skins. Use basic Android, provide the same features as ANY competitor for less money. Profit. Why do you need to skin anything?Overall a great device, and Sammy should be ashamed.

It really feels like a flagship device, but without the ludicrous flagship price tag. It's not a perfect phone, but delivers on the aspects that matter most to me: Performance, screen quality, and battery life + charging speed. The phone doesn't skip a beat with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, and up to a whopping 16GB RAM. Gorgeous screen with 1440p resolution and buttery 120Hz that dynamically scales down to save battery. Speaking of which, the battery experience is wonderful. I'm seeing 1.5-2 days of regular use before needing to charge back up, which takes less than 30 mins!The phone does have some shortcomings however: No wireless charging, IP64 instead of IP68, USB 2.0, decent cameras that are overshadowed by the competition, and finally a very different UI experience compared to OxygenOS of the past. These are all sacrifices that I'm willing to make given the price point of the phone.Conclusion: It's a well rounded flagship level phone that makes smart compromises in order to justify a more reasonable price. For the money it's hard to find a better value in terms of sheer hardware specs than the OnePlus 11. Although not quite the ""flagship killer"" we used to know, this showing is certainly a step in the right direction.","February 22, 2023"

It's glitchy, fussy, and appears to be unstable in my opinion. Things on it get copied and pasted out of nowhere without your intervention. The screen is sometimes unresponsive or gets very jumpy. The finger sensor on the front is so dumb and leaves excessive prints on your screen. If you buy a screen protector, the fingerprint sensor will struggle to read your fingerprint. This phone is slower than expected because of the burned in bloatware. I am not seeing the speed as a Snapdragon Gen 2 should be, and that is because of the bloatware. One of my older phones seem about the same speed as this one. This phone isn't fast. The selection of mobile carriers will disappoint you. I could not get Verizon and the many Verizon sub-carriers to work with it. But AT&T and T-Mobile and their sub-carriers are a go. This phone is overpriced in my opinion.

It is missing many 5G NR bands that were previously included in the OnePlus 9 pro. It also lacks the 4k 120hz HDR video recording capability the OnePlus 9 pro has. For those two reasons I did end up returning it. The main bands I was concerned about are NR258, NR260, and NR261. Those three bands have serious speed in them. The main three carriers in the US and their mvnos utilize those bands for signal in their networks. Because of this, this phone will not give you the best possible signal. I know TMobile is pushing the Samsung Galaxy S series as the S23 series are the only phones guaranteed to work with their 4 channel carrier aggregation at this moment...

One plus is back. There will be people that have there loyalty to a product but my loyalty is to the company that makes a good product. One plus has again created a great phone with OP11. Top specs, great battery life and great build. I have had phone for about 10 days and it performs excellent. Had the Samsung S21 ultra which is a good phone like all Samsung top tear phones but OP is a flagship killer for it's prices, specs, and performance. Some people complain about wireless charging not be available but wit a battery that last like this there no need. 6.7 inch vs 6.8 inch is no contest. Smaller form factor makes it easier to used on hold. Adding back the slider for mute, vibrate, and sound is awesome. You can always nick pick any product but if you are looking for an exceptional smartphone at a great price OP11 is at the top of the android chart.","July 27, 2023"

Too many accessories and benefits lost by not having this on the phone.When I say the battery tech is impressive, it charged it from 46% to 100% in 20-something minutes.Otherwise it seems up to par with flagship devices, so I won’t give it 1-star.

So i decide i'd never buy an iphone ever again. So i was looking at other expensive options and narrowed my choice down to Samsung or this company. I chose this company due to the cheaper price than Samsung Ultra 23.  camera seems fine.  which is one of the reasons i upgraded to an expensive phone.  i also wanted more internal storage, that's another reason i purchased.  what i dont like about the cell phone and all cell phones is that when i put it in my jacket or coat pocket, the phone hurts my insides.  stomach, side, etc.  The cancer and reproductive harm risk is real.  Also when i have it in my hand a long time, i get pain as well.  due to that radiation risk, etc.  I was forced to buy a cell phone because its the way people use social media and connect, and post content, etc.  But I would prefer not to have a cell phone at all due to the cancer and reproductive harm risk, which is very clear with the pain i get when carrying it in my pocket and holding it in my hand.","March 6, 2023"

Problem is it freezes up with OEM email app, OEM texting app, and an installed forum app. Locking up has progressively gotten worse over the last few weeks. For example attempting to do the return through Amazon app I ended up staring at an all white screen for about a minute before I gave up, rebooted and tried again.Also if I'm running Spotify in the background or get a phone call, no apps want to work afterwards.

This phone with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, 16GB RAM simply rocks. Great screen resolution and smooth 120Hz that can dynamically scale down. The cameras are ok, a lot better than the ones my other phones had. Oxygen OS is ok as well, somewhat different from other experiences I've had but it's nice.The phone has some cons that to me are that important: No wireless charging (not really necessary with supervooc charging), IP64 instead of IP68, USB 2.0.

I needed to take a video to show how the monitors were glitching on a train and send them back only problem was the camera on my phone kept freezing during the video for up to 5 seconds. Then after repeated attempts it would freeze and shut off. I downloaded several other camera apps and they all had similar issues so I'm guessing it's the camera itself. I need to take close up pictures for work and this camera struggles to get good close up pictures. Battery life and charging rates are this phones strong points it's nice to plug it in and have a full charge in less than 30 minutes. Overnight charging at the slow rate was problematic I set my alarm for 4 am and got up with 70 percent charge but didn't notice until I was at work with no chargers available and almost ran out of charge since I could never figure out why I turned off that feature.

In other apps where it actually supports 120hz refresh rate, the throttling is very agressive. This leads to a bad scrolling experience especially when compared to similar priced phones from Samsung. Having different scroll speed on different apps is very annoying and it only gets worse with time.Audio:Dolby Atmos only works with Bluetooth. No support on phone speaker and the deal breaker for me - no support on Android auto. So of you care about music quality while driving, look elsewhere.Haptics:Haptics mechanism itself is good overall. For some reason no way to enable haptics for home gesture. It works for back and recent gesture. This is very annoying.Charging:Very fast. Full charge under 30 mins. But you need to carry a OnePlus charger everywhere you go. Phone battery is good, so you can live with it.So the overall theme is that they are trying to make a fast phone, but the experience is NOT smooth.

You might guess that I'm a fan of having a ""pure"" Android experience on my devices, and you'd be right. If you are like me and think that using a Samsung phone with all the ""value-added"" bloat is a torturous experience, then I'm sorry to say that I believe OnePlus is clearly going down that route.The moment I started setting up the phone, I could tell something wasn't right. There was too much flashy nonsense, but I got to the end of the setup and started looking around. Almost nothing is vanilla; you've got OnePlus's special homescreen, their icons, their apps, their theme. They've got ""wonderful"" value-added features that you can, admittedly, turn some of them off in the settings. But once you explore some more, you find a bunch of totally useless bloat.At the same time, while there's some bloat, it's still surprising how they manage to ruin Android such that right from the beginning, you notice pointless battery drain that shouldn't be happening. Not to mention, if you dig a little deeper, you'll find out about the stuff under the hood, OnePlus's special throttling, and you can read about their well-known benchmark manipulation and so on.Take a peek at forums, and you'll see people complaining about constant instability and old bugs never addressed, updates rolling out so slowly that some people only get an update after the subsequent version has already come out. Even for security updates, which frankly should be a big deal, they are still rolled out slower than they should be. The entire point of security updates for Android is that they're important, they're time-sensitive, and they're easy to implement, right?So, if you want this phone because you think you're going to get something like a vanilla or ""pure"" Android experience, please don't bother. In fact, just get a Samsung instead if you're willing to deal with annoying bloat. At least in that case, the hardware is better. OnePlus isn't even cheap anymore, anyway.","November 18, 2023"

I've had a OnePlus 3T, 5T, and 7T, and they were all great phones that worked perfectly. The OnePlus 11 5G gave me problems from the beginning. It failed to recognize any usb connection to share files, and did not work with Android auto (since it wouldn't recognize any usb connection other than charging the phone). After doing some research, I found out how to get into the developer setting and enable the usb recognition, so my Android auto connection began to work, but the every time I turned the car off and on again, I would have to restart the phone and update the usb setting again before the phone would recognize the usb connection. It was too much hassle for something that should just work automatically.  I saw in some forums that this is also the case with their version 10 phone, so it must be an issue with their most recent OS. I'm going to wait for them to address the bugs before I buy another OnePlus anytime soon.","April 2, 2023"

I have had  OnePlus3T, OnePlus6, Oneplus7(for a short period of time this on I broke it), OnePlus8T, and now the onePlus115G (this without considering earbuds and other accessories).It has been a great phone for 7 months. Last night I went to bed as usual, read a few articles and went to sleep, the next morning my phone was off, which thought about right as it probably got discharged (had about 10% charge), so I plugged it in for 30 minutes, when I came back the phone was overheated and still off and unable to turn on.I called support the first agent dropped the call. The second agent Erna (10:29 AM 11/24/2023) transferred me to a supervisor Stefan, who said to be from escalation Support.The bottom line, is to get support I need the IMEI, but the phone does not have an IMEI on the back; I seriously no longer have the original box, so what I was told is that they can't do anything for me because I need the IMEI to start a service request. Amazon invoice and order do not show the IMEI.So I really have an expensive brick in my hands because the manufacturer has no process or means to support me. I have been a customer for 9 years, and never required support from them, a nd now that I really need some help, their response is that I need to understand they can't do anything without the IMEI.So this is the last OnePlus phone I get and I would seriously advise you to get another brand other than OnePlus because they will not blink before throwing you into the water, no real customer service.","November 24, 2023"

Better cameras. New operating systems but it's all over compensating malware garbage. New phone but a million updates which make is slower and less responsive. Like every phone. It's fast right out the box. After the million updates it gets slower and less responsive. Even if you turn on high performance and I'm not using this phone to play games. I'm using it to get work done. So simple stuff really. Apparently it seems impossible to remove the google home screen news widget on the far left side. All things google don't want to work well. Makes me want to get my 4 year old phone back out just to do basic stuff that works right. Going onto Google maps looking for tow trucks. First location wants to bug out and throw all my settings backwards like metric. Then when I try to view reviews, websites, etc looking for tow trucks it wants to crash. Show me nothing. This is running off home wifi. When I go to phone data it won't work at all. When something is time sensitive like looking up a tow truck for my vehicle sitting on the side of the road I don't need problems. Btw I'm not blaming this phone. One plus is legit. I'm blaming Google and Android snapdragon processor. It just updated to the newest version this morning. 13.1 I believe. They are never going to stop making all this new super fast hardware slow with all this new software malware. So it doesn't matter if you get this phone or a S23 cause it's the same instituted malware filled snapdragon processor and Android operating system and they will continue to max out its hardware with resource consuming software that way its never really an upgrade it's just a constant battle to stay with the times and draining your income.","July 29, 2023"

The camera is pretty great as well I've been impressed with the quality of low light shots especially.And yet, despite being ostensibly everything I want in a phone, in less than 3 months I have come to despise this device. I will be replacing it as soon as possible. The OS is nothing short of rage inducing. Constant harassment about battery optimization is the most egregious issue. Even on apps I've explicitly marked do not optimize. Even on so called performance mode where I've been forced to acknowledge that battery life might suffer before turning it on.It makes me want to throw it against the wall. Notifications never come on time. My email updates once a day most of the time. I'll get texts hours late. This is the only phone I've had in the past 5 years that frequently and repetitively closes Spotify while I'm listening.It literally just popped up another notification trying to coerce me into ""optimizing"" an app I've specifically marked never optimize. Because ""optimize"" actually means ""remove 90% of the functionality you installed the app for in the first place"".Do not buy this phone unless you want to be treated as if you have a toddler's understanding of tech.

The macro lense never takes quite crisp enough pictures. The main cameras zoom is grainy and pixelated. The main cameras video doesn't have good stabilization software2) trying to change media output is a pain compared to other phones, leaving you swiping the tray down twice, clicking a menu, clicking media output, and finally able to change it3) you can't change the shortcuts on the lock screen for some reason4) it is hard to disable the Google feed screen which I personally find useless. You have to disable the entire Google app. This was an issue on the N100 as well.5) after the last system update their ""red cable club"" app, is no longer in the app menu and cannot be uninstalled or disabled, and thus it is requesting updates when I will NEVER use it.6) after the same update, the Shelf (a secondary tray essentially) which was useful at first due to the pedometer and ability to add extra widgets like Wundergrounds weather, suddenly you can't use any custom widgets and the remaining options all suck, so it's an entire tray with one useful app... Aka, as good as useless.7) No MicroSD slot for the sole purpose of trying to force you to pay more for the next level sub-model. This is becoming a common practice, but it remains a BS one. It would be like a new TV not coming with any inputs, to try and force you to buy the higher model that has a built in Xbox console. You upgrade and get the Xbox and streaming apps, but you better hope you never want a blu-ray player or PS2. In this case it makes it a complete pain in the ass to transfer videos and photos or to clean them up on a larger screen, as the cable connection on phones has always been clunky compared to swapping a MicroSD.1+ OxygenOS is a love hate thing.

The charger and cable are worth $125 alone. Great screen, solid build quality, fastest charger ever and good quality cameras make for a good package. Switching from IPhone is dead simple with the included usb-c to usb-a adapter included in the box. If you have an iPhone, make sure you turn off “optimize photos” a day or two in advance so all your full resolution photos download to the phone. I was able to transfer all my photos and all of my messages from iMessage to the Google messages app. This was important to me because I have a lot of saved conversations I want to keep.

The main camera is pretty good, but the ultra wide and the Marco... Not good enough. Something that's disappointing is it only have 1 sim card slot, and it doesn't have a free case in the box (btw the Chinese version do have a very good colored soft case depends on what color you are buying) and a screen is a regular 1080p 120hz boe screen without dc dimming or high frequency pwm dimming, so if your eyes are sensitive, maybe it's not the best choice for you.

But I thought it was time to move on anyway.I looked for OP7Tpro screen repairs but they were too expensive, so I decided to take advantage of this OP deal and buy it without doing much research, trusting the brand.I regret that decision now. This phone does not have a flagship camera, the main camera zoom is blurry, the stabilization software is poor, there is no dual sim card slot. And worst of all, NO ALERT SLIDERS! That was the feature that made OP phones stand out from the rest.I know I could have avoided some of these issues if I had read the descriptions before buying, but I never expected OP to lower their standards so much in their recent phones.

When Amazon listed this device at 549, I ran out of excuses not to pick it up...The cameras on the phone are more than adequate and I consider myself a fairly competent photographer.. 4K and 8K video is stunning... Battery charging is insanely fast.. better than anything I've ever seen before obviously.. 15 minutes at an airport kiosk will get you up to speed with the supplied 65 watt charger.. just make sure you use the cable that comes with it.. some skinny little cheese cable from the 99 cent store is not going to cut it..The phone is also just the right size.. much lighter and smaller than my v60.. it's a wolf in sheep's clothing and the price is great!You're definitely going to want to purchase a phone case and screen protector.. remember to redo your fingerprint scan or not even set it up until after you get the screen protector on.. many have complained about the fingerprint reader AFTER they have applied a screen protector.. that's not the phone's fault... Just delete the old fingerprint and rescan it with the screen protector in place! It's not that hard.Update*  I've had the phone for a little over 3 weeks now and am still very impressed with it... I get all of the buzz and criticism about camera performance but I have to say again this phone's cameras are beyond adequate.  Performance remains seemless and smooth, with no lag apparent despite multiple apps / functions running together.  All in all a great phone at a great price.","November 25, 2022"
OnePlus 10 Pro | 5G Android Smartphone | 8GB+128GB | U.S. Unlocked | Triple Camera co-Developed with Hasselblad | Volcanic Black,Luis Escobar,5.0,"I've owned the phone for a few months now. Here is my honest review. Battery is a all day battery, I have no problems answering phone calls and texting all day and even watching TikTok and browsing social media. The camera itself is really nice, however the camera tends to get blurry the farther you zoom in to take photos which I understand it doesn't have a long range camera which is OK. The selfie camera in front of the unit is awesome, not many phones have great selfie cameras and it's actually surprising. Now for people claiming it comes with color OS. It does not. It comes with Oxygen OS 12 (Android 12), Color OS is only non US Models. Now I'm a T-Mobile customer, I know TMobile has MMWave Technology, and this phone does not have it. The one thing that really makes up for that is that it can do 5G Support or 4G LTE Support, now 90% of areas I'm in have the 5g support down here in South West Florida. When I'm in towns or busy business areas, doing speed tests on the T-Mobile network, I've gotten between 40 Mbps download to 700 Mbps in select areas and 30 upload to 80 upload which is more then enough and even faster then Xfinity internet...... That I'm paying for in my house..... Honestly going from 4G Support to 5G support on the T-Mobile network really shocked me in coverage and speeds. This phone does support lots of 5g bands and even 4g bands. Now besides network connectivity, battery and the camera this is one solid phone. I came from a Samsung S10+. Now before buying this phone I got the pleasure to play around with the S22 and the One Plus 10 Pro, depending on the deals going on value per dollar will vary. I ended up going with the One Plus 10 Pro since the price, the battery is comparable to the S22 Ultra and is a solid phone. I will give it 4.5 stars due to the zoom features being alittle lack luster. Everything else is solid on the phone. Please note that the One Plus 10 Pro US Model only has one sim card slot, and only supports 65 Watts. At the time of purchase it said 85 watts which is not true. Only the non US Model at this time has 85 Watts and dual sim capabilities.A newer one plus 10 is coming out featuring more ram and more storage so keep an eye out for that too. It may also have more features.","June 14, 2022"
OnePlus 10 Pro | 5G Android Smartphone | 8GB+128GB | U.S. Unlocked | Triple Camera co-Developed with Hasselblad | Volcanic Black,RC26271,5.0,"I have had an iPhone for about 2 years and I was well ready to get back to Android and not have a ton of bloatware. I chose OnePlus for the reputation, and quick charging, and so far this phone has not let me down too much.Charging us fantastic, and the image and video play back has been great, but the camera leaves a lot to be desired. I don't know what it is, but things just don't look right with this camera and I can't seem to adjust in the way that I want, and I am pretty well versed with a DSLR.There is also no sd slot, which is hear breaking, but I got 256gb; let's hope it's enough down the road.Overall, it's been a great phone with great features and yes, I would buy again, but make sure you upgrade to Android 13, cause 12 was bad. also, oxygenOS leaves a lot of be desired. Hopefully they get things fixed down the road, but for now it's just ""ok"" at best.","February 9, 2023"
OnePlus 10 Pro | 5G Android Smartphone | 8GB+128GB | U.S. Unlocked | Triple Camera co-Developed with Hasselblad | Volcanic Black,RC26271,4.0,"BEFORE I GET INTO THE PROS AND CONS OF THIS PHONE I'LL LAY OUT THE BASICS OF WHAT THIS PHONE PROVIDES RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX WHEN YOU FIRST START USING ITThe phone comes with a 65-w supervuuc charger. It also comes with a screen protector pre-installed but no phone case. It has the SIM card tray key included as well with some nomenclature about the phone as well. I bought the American US version and use AT&t service on it. Other reviews mentioned not being able to use AT&t or 5G but that is all in the past as I have 5G on my AT&t service with this phone and it is very fast and works perfectly. Also some people complain about not being able to use Netflix or some other streaming services but they might have not had the US version as I set up all of my streaming services such as netflix, HBO max, hulu, Amazon prime video etc.Also, the software they use for moving data from your old device to this one was the fastest I've ever moved my storage and data as well as phone settings to another phone ever. They did very well on that.PROS:*CAMERA:  The camera is not bad, pretty good in fact but compared to a Samsung or an iPhone it just barely comes up short. Again it is not bad just not as good as a iPhone or Samsung. No one could ever tell the difference when I send them pictures I've taken with this phone or show them. But they are always curious as to what phone I'm using because it is different.*DESIGN AND BUILD:  Phone has a great design, maybe just because it's different from many other phones? It is very slippery though unfortunately as I wish I didn't have to put a case on it. I do like how the material on the back has a mat granite type of look. And I learned to like the camera bump. The build feels very sturdy and does not feel cheap at all. It has a flagship quality build I would say.*PERFORMANCE:  The phone is very fast though, it operates fairly well with everything I threw at it including the most demanding games you can play on a smartphone. The 120 HZ refresh rate is incredibly smooth and can go from one to 120 HZ based on what you are doing and I have never noticed any hiccups. It always felt zippy and fast.Your RAM increase options with the software are also great. I believe I was able to up my ram just using the software to 19 gigs.*BATTERY:  The battery charges very fast and can hold on to that power pretty well throughout the day and halfway through the next. If you are a heavy user and are constantly playing power demanding phone games you will have to charge it at night most likely. I usually charge it in the morning around 20 to 35% while I brush my teeth and get ready and it's done by the time I'm out of the shower. Pretty much 15 minutes will get you to 80 or 90%, which should definitely last you all day unless you ended up using it very heavy, which also you just need to charge it for a little bit again and you'll have another full day. I was able to Outlast my girlfriend's iPhone 13 Max. She always ends up with a low battery unexpectedly as well as me so it is nice not to have to charge it for an hour and a half to two hours to get a full battery. It takes 25 minutes for a full battery 0% - 100% which is nuts. (Although to get it to charge this fast you do have to enable and disable some settings as far as battery health settings go. They do this for people who are worried about the health of their battery as fast charging could supposedly have a negative impact on the battery's long-term health but I find that is not the case and I've been fast charging phones for a couple years.) Let's face it though, at the end of the day our battery levels are almost always between 20 and 30%, so 15 minutes charge and you are pretty much good to go has been a great perk using this phone. Never worried about having a dead phone or not enough battery before going out. It was about 4:00 p.m. and I didn't charge my phone since the morning from the previous day and when my girlfriend told me we had to meet up some friends for a night out but had to leave pretty much right then, I threw my phone on the charger at 12% for a little over 5 minutes and I had 65%. I used it for GPS, video and photos that night and some tipsy phone calls when we got home and I didn't have to charge it until the next day in the afternoon.*SPEAKERS/ MEDIA CONSUMPTION:  The speakers work on both the top and bottom of the phone and sound great. They will definitely get loud enough and don't ever get raspy or have a tinny sound.*CALL QUALITY/ SERVICE/ HOTSPOT:  The call quality on this phone is extremely good. Both the earpiece when receiving calls as well as making calls worked perfectly as far as sound quality. Anyone who I called said it sounded great all the time. I even called my other phones as I have to numbers and it always sounds incredibly good. Hotspot is also easy to set up and I get service everywhere. This thing can get reception and data as best as your carrier can dish it out. 5G works just fine with my carrier AT&t. I saw some other reviews on here saying these phones will not work with at&t, or the 5G doesn't work but AT&t fixed that and OnePlus is fully operational with AT&t's service.*OS AND SOFTWARE:  Because I am not coming from another one plus phone I can't say it is as good, better or worse than the previous operating systems but I can say that they aren't bad at all. Compared to Samsung though, the customization isn't as great, just a little more limited but nothing nearly as restrained as iPhones iOS. Also Android 13 should be coming out in the next month to a few months on the American versions,  But Android 12 still works perfectly fine.  I haven't set up the face unlock on this as I never use it on any phones, except for the iPhone cuz it forces you to but even then I always end up using a code on the iPhone when face unlock doesn't want to work at night or whatever other lame instance. This has a quick and reliable fingerprint reader which I've always loved on phones and honestly wish they at least kept it as another option rather than taking it away.CONS:*BRIGHTNESS:  The brightness is the main issue I have with this phone. It's not terrible but I also use an iPhone 13, Samsung flip and fold 4 and those get very bright. Again it's not terrible but I always have my brightness up to 100 on all my phones. You can still see it just fine during the daylight so it's really not that big of a deal, brightness is just something I like personally when it comes to phones.To be honest, this phone was incredibly easy to set up, use and work with on a daily basis. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good Android phone and would like something different from what's mostly out there. The main takeaway I got from this phone was having a flagship device and never having to worry about the battery or having to charge the battery.I hope this review helped.","December 6, 2022"
OnePlus 10 Pro | 5G Android Smartphone | 8GB+128GB | U.S. Unlocked | Triple Camera co-Developed with Hasselblad | Volcanic Black,Chris,5.0,"I hate cell phones.  I had a cracked screen for the last 3 years.  It was ugly, unsightly, embarassing, but functional.This phone?  This phone is great.  I feel like I got it for a steal.

OnePlus 10 Pro | 5G Android Smartphone | 8GB+128GB | U.S. Unlocked | Triple Camera co-Developed with Hasselblad | Volcanic Black,Chris,1.0,"I bought this phone through this medium and was thrilled when it arrived, it was fast, powerful, beautiful, it had it all. But then it was showing its shortcomings. Out of nowhere I have software problems where I want to turn on the phone screen, but it is impossible, I pressed and pressed the power button and it does not turn on, after letting it sit for a couple of minutes I noticed that it turns on and off by itself, how reacting to the times I pressed the button. I left it more time to rest and then it came back to normal operation. This has happened to me 3 times already. On the other hand I bought a phone protector from Spigen, it is expensive and specifically designed for this phone, but unlike the product description where they state that the back is made of hard and resistant ceramic, I can confirm that it is a total lie. A few days ago I wanted to remove the phone protector and I discovered that it had 3 cracks on the back, no sense why I have never dropped it on the floor, I take care of my phones with my life, but apparently the phone is not resistant at all, I do not know what happened, I have no idea, but I am extremely disappointed. Unfortunately I discovered all this a little after the end of the 30 days return period, I feel totally ripped off and despite this, I contacted Amazon, as expected they did not help me, but redirected me to contact OnePlus, they told me they would replace it, but that is a lie, OnePlus claims that for purchases within Amazon they are not responsible. Amazon also told me they would help me if OnePlus didn't take care of it, but they didn't, now I have a broken phone that is worth a lot of money. A very bad investment, now I understand why it is always on discount, they are trying to get rid of this phone and the missing stock. DO NOT BUY IT","February 18, 2023"
OnePlus 10 Pro | 5G Android Smartphone | 8GB+128GB | U.S. Unlocked | Triple Camera co-Developed with Hasselblad | Volcanic Black,M. Hernandez,5.0,"I'm beyond confused concerning the negative reviews around this phone. For the price the OnePlus 10 pro is hands down the best phone at this price point. I've had everything from the 12 pro max, the Xiaomi Mi 11 ultra, the s22 ultra all costing well over the price of this phone and this phone is just as good. The oxygen experience is fantastic. A clean, lightning fast OS. The camera quality is incredible. The Hasselblad tuning of the camera adds a unique life to photos. Facial unlock is blazing fast, fingerprint scanner blows Pixel 6 pro out of the water.80 watt charger in the box 0-100% in under 30 minutesCase in the box as well?! Samsung WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!TALK ABOUT SMOOTH?! This phone feels buttery smooth. It's heavy in the hands and feels like it's built to withstand war.It doesn't feel as good in the hand as a note 20 ultra but feels better in the hand then the S22 Ultra.All in all I absolutely love this phone and the user experience.

OnePlus 10 Pro | 5G Android Smartphone | 8GB+128GB | U.S. Unlocked | Triple Camera co-Developed with Hasselblad | Volcanic Black,Tyler,5.0,"The Phone is a marvel of technology. Everything that was promised by One Plus’s website. However there were irregularities with the shipped device. It was not properly packed. It came inside an Amazon bubble bag and not in a shipping Box as I was expecting it to be, since it is such a wonderful device. Box was in poor condition. The phone box itself was not taped or sealed, which means that it was used, And I purchased it as a “New” device. The box had glue all over, from the tape removal before shipping. Maybe that is why the price for the device was much less than the advertised price on the manufacturer’s website.Device was on Android 12 and still no “OTA” to Android 13 from One Plus as promised. Also the phone is not “Play Protect Certified”. For the lack of good presentation (by the seller) and those other observations (by One Plus), I do not recommend this seller.As far as One Plus is concerned, I was sadly dissatisfied and disappointed, after so many promises. Amazon should make sure that sellers and Manufacturers comply seriously with what they sell using Amazon services.","August 8, 2023"
OnePlus 10 Pro | 5G Android Smartphone | 8GB+128GB | U.S. Unlocked | Triple Camera co-Developed with Hasselblad | Volcanic Black,Leif Robert Langford,4.0,"I was going back and forth on this phone for a while, and I can honestly say that I am happy that I got it. As a long time user of Samsung and Pixel phones on the Android side of things, this is honestly a better phone in almost every way possible- aside from that camera.The unit I received was brand new as described, and it was in perfect working condition. I was able to easily add my SIM card to it and transfer my Google Fi number to this phone in just a few minutes. (Note, this phone does not support eSIM, so you will need a physical SIM card to set it up.) The setup was also very easy and simple to do and has the same data and app transfer option as on other android devices.Once set up, it was still on Android 12 by default, but I did have a large series of updates that took about an hour to fully get it up to the latest release of Android 13. The phone had approximately 7 updates in this time frame.Software:Once fully updated, OxygenOS was a breath of fresh air. For the first time in a long time, I felt like I was using a version of Android that was more customizable than ever as well as giving the default Android-like experience a whole new form. OxygenOS was cleaner and more modern than any other Android skin I've seen, with a translucent app and notification drawer, subtle icon animations when expanding the quick settings, and so much more. Even the built-in clock has a red color for the ""1"" digits as a subtle nod to OnePlus itself. While the entire skin feels smoother than any Android experience I have ever had, it is also the most customizable. You can change the icons to a number of different shapes, sizes, styles, and colors and the same goes for the software color themes, home page screen transitions, the always on display, and even the battery icon style itself. It's an endlessly adjustable software to reflect the style you like the most and I really, really like that. When it comes to ringtones it even has a much higher amount of ringtones I've ever seen preloaded on a phone, and the haptics are out of this world as each ringtone has haptics that respond identically to the tune that is playing. It's just that great and I haven't even mentioned the side quick app drawer or the shelf features. Also, despite being a physical switch, the phone also has a three-way slider above the power button that can instantly switch your phone between Ring, Haptic, and Silent modes as well as muting your audio automatically. It's similar to the silent mode switch on an iPhone but better, in my opinion.Performance:When it comes to performance I was very impressed. Despite the fact that I got the 8GB of RAM model, the phone was snappy and blazing fast. Apps launched in no time and apps scrolled with perfect butter-y action with that 120Hz display. My games were lag free in all that I tried and I am just overall very pleased with the performance.Display:In this phone is an LTPO gen 2 OLED panel that is one of the best I've seen aside from a Samsung phone. Not only is it able to automatically adjust its frame rate to conserve battery life, but it does it in a way that you wouldn't otherwise notice. There is no hitching or stuttering or weird glitches from the display shifting its frame rate and it is just a flawless experience. Not only that, the display is incredibly vivid, detailed, and bright and I didn't notice any color shifting like on some lower quality OLED panels. The HDR looks great, and the screen is super immersive. You will not be disappointed when playing games or watching content as it is one of the best displays I have seen. However, I am not the biggest fan of the curved edges as I prefer a flat display but the edges of the display are not too troublesome or as curved as some others.Battery Life:At first I was slightly worried that the battery wasn't going to be good as despite its exceptionally fast charging speeds, my phone was depleting charge extremely fast the first few days that I had it. In the days since, the battery has held up much better with somedays giving me as much as triple the screen on time compared to when I first got it. I assume that this is from the adaptive battery functionality finally optimizing itself based on how I use my phone and what apps I run, but it is something to take note of as you must give the phone a few days to get this kind of battery life. Presently, I am able to use it all day with about 30% charge left around bedtime. Now, the most standout feature about this phone is its charging capabilities. From a near 0 charge, this phone can almost completely get back to 100% in just 30 minutes which is crazy to me as I am used to phones taking anywhere from 1 hour to 2 hours to fully charge. So, if you just need a quick charge, just plug this in for a few minutes and you'll get a couple hours of screen time. It's that fast. If you prefer to charge wirelessly, it will also support insanely fast wireless charge speeds, but you have to make sure your wireless charger is capable of putting out the necessary wattage.Speakers:The speakers on this phone are very good. While they don't get as loud as I would like, they do deliver fuller and more natural sounding audio compared to other phones I have used. Voices sound crisp and clear, and music sounds detailed and rich. The only disappointment I have with the speaker aside from the volume level is that the bass is not very noticeable, but this isn't that much of an issue to me. The speakers deliver what I would describe as a mostly ""flat"" or otherwise balanced sound EQ.Build Quality:This is also without a doubt one of the most comfortable phones I have ever used. Even though I usually put a case on all of my devices, this is probably the only one I would consider using without one. The back of the phone has this unusual but incredibly well done powdered granite-like feel as the frosted matte finish is soft and soothing against the hands. It doesn’t look or feel like glass at all as it feels more like a soft stone, and the best part is this finish doesn’t leave fingerprints of any kind which means you don’t need to constantly wipe it down. It also gives it a slight amount of grip to hold as it isn’t slippery. Despite not being a fan of curved edges, the design of the phone is not too narrow or too wide which allows it to fit almost perfectly in my hands as if it was naturally designed for them. The phone is also very light weight despite all that is packed inside of it, and I just really think the design, feel and weight of the phone is one of the best I have ever used.Camera:We are finally at the weakest part of the entire phone. Despite the Hasselblad partnership, the cameras on this phone just can't quite live up to the photos taken on other Android phones such as the Pixel series or Galaxy Ultra phones. It gets even worse when you compare the selfie cameras as the photos taken by this phone are extremely soft and lack detail. While the rear camera can still take some fairly good photos, it is more of a ""luck of the draw"" as sometimes it will capture a good photo and other times it will not. Videos are even worse. While most android phones have never really been that good when it comes to video, there is something noticeably wrong with the videos I record with this phone. It's like all the saturation got turned up to a 1000 as the colors are way over done compared to real life in addition to all the shadow details being crushed with nothing but pure black. It's still usable to make a quick post, but I would not recommend using it to record videos for content creation. Overall, it is not the worst camera by any means as it is still fairly good, but it just doesn't live up to my expectations.Overall, this is an excellent phone that when on sale, I would say is better than almost anything else aside from the camera. At the current sub-500 cost, the performance, battery life, display quality, and software experience is unrivaled. The only thing that hurts the value in my opinion is the camera, but it excels in almost every other category. I highly recommend it.","September 10, 2023"

The new MSM tool uses a unique key pair for each phone that links to oopos servers for the private key. So you need oopo credentials. While I'm sure someone will find a way eventually I'm not able to provide much in the way of research with my current situation. Their merger with oopo has been a failure there's things that I just can't tolerate with oos like the relatively weak encryption and security standards. Which are admittably Android standard.

The Quick Start Guide only shows where buttons are located... something my 1yo granddaughter knows, not one thing mentioned for features, settings, etc. After deciding to check the seller's listing (as if I read wrong), it does say the screen protector and case are missing and I found the 20pg User Manual as a PDF file also. Now I must go step by step to backtrack customizing and personalizing settings which seems more complicated than when I (as an Android user) setup my grandson's iPhone without need for instructions. This phone has alternative names for features within a feature of simple things that requires you to figure out what's being referenced-especially without the manual. I upgraded from OnePlus 7 Pro so the terms of stupidity used for simple features or settings within features is extremely unnecessary.

Many noticications aren't shown at all, and you have to unlock the phone to see only SOME of them.On the bright side, the screen looks good and the touch works well so far (bought the phone 4-5 months ago).All in all, the bad fingerprint reader is a good enough reason NOT to buy this phone in my opinion.","January 14, 2024"

I was originally trying to decide between it vs a flagship Pixel or iPhone.  I listed out the pros and cons of each.  I was concerned about the Pixel's modem/connectivity issues.  I was concerned about paying a premium to Apple to be part of their proprietary world.  The OnePlus is everything I could ask for.  It is a real powerhouse.  It did take me a bit of effort to customize it to my personal tastes, but now it is exactly the way I prefer.  The battery life and camera, though not quite as good as those of the iPhone Pro Max, are nevertheless outstanding and more than adequate for my needs.","October 19, 2022"

OnePlus 10 Pro | 5G Android Smartphone | 8GB+128GB | U.S. Unlocked | Triple Camera co-Developed with Hasselblad | Volcanic Black,RC26271,1.0,"I purchased the OnePlus 10 Pro 5G (256GB, 12GB RAM, Factory Unlocked - China Version with Google Play, Black) about four months ago. Regrettably, my experience has led to more frustration than satisfaction.Short-Lived Functionality: Remarkably, the phone only worked properly for a mere four months. For a device of its caliber and price range, this is a significantly shorter lifespan than expected.Display Issues: The most severe problem is with the display, which became increasingly unresponsive over time and now fails to turn on at all. This critical issue has rendered the phone unusable.Battery Drain: Additionally, the battery performance was subpar. I noticed that the battery would drain at an alarmingly fast rate, which is a significant inconvenience and not what you expect from a new smartphone.Biometric Failures: Both the fingerprint reader and face recognition features have been disappointingly unreliable. The fingerprint reader ceased functioning correctly within a few months, and the face recognition was inconsistent right from the beginning.Overall Reliability: These issues collectively raise serious doubts about the reliability and quality control of this model. It's a letdown, especially from a brand like OnePlus, which is known for its quality smartphones.Advice to Potential Buyers: Please exercise caution if you're considering this phone. My experience suggests that it might not live up to the expected standards of a flagship model in terms of durability and performance. I recommend looking at multiple reviews and considering other options before making a decision.","November 24, 2023"

Scren is great.  Fingerprint and face unlock is great.  Super fast on 5G.  I'm very happy now that I have gotten it to work.But a couple of warnings:If you are a Sprint customer who thinks you are a T-Mobile customer, you are NOT!  You are still on the Sprint telecommunications network, even though you are able to also use the T-Mobile towers.  This phone, no matter what you do, WILL NOT ACTIVATE on the Sprint network.  Not even in any kind compatibility mode.  Sprint's activation and registration software and systems identifies this phone as a FOREIGN device and there is NO WAY to activate the IMEI number range this phone has been assigned on the Sprint network.  Don't waste your time trying!  I tried 3 different ways.  Not happening!The only way I could get the phone to activate was to open up a T-Mobile account and transfer my number over.  If you are a single phone line Sprint customer and do not have any balance owed on yourphone, this is an easy thing to do.  And you should do it.  The phone activates instantly on the T-Mobile network.But if you have any balance on your Sprint account for any of your active lines, you will need to pay all of those balances off to zero them before you can move over to T-Mobile.  Again, another wonderful side affect of the Sprint and T-Mobile accounting systems not yet being compatible.Again, if you have been a Sprint customer, you are not yet a T-Mobile customer.  Not until you have switched your account.  At this point, this has to be done by you.  And can not be done if you still have outstanding balances (lease, payments) for your phone on Sprint.  T-Mobile is not doing this automatically yet.  The Sprint phone support I talked to said that there may be some work starting offering deals to get Sprint customers converted over the holidays.  So look for that.Lastly, two days after I bought the phone, Amazon lowered the price by $100.  I chatted with the Amazon Customer support team to see if I could get a refund of the difference in prices.  Again, NOT HAPPENING!  It's not in Amazon's customer service policy to refund differences in prices for your purchases when they happen in just a 2 day period.  I could understand a longer duration, like 5 or more days.  But TWO DAYS?  Really?  I have had experience with a large number of brick-and-mortor retailers that would happily refund the difference in purchase price when an items prices are reduced shortly after purchase.  So, be warned that Amazon does not have a customer service policy like this and seems to not have any way to offer a customer pleasing exemption.I guess I could take some comfort in the idea that my non-refunded $100 could go towards more rocket fuel for Jeff Bazos' next trip into space.","July 23, 2021"

Elliott,5.0,"The build quality is solid, and premium feeling in the hand.

Standard mobile games and most applications will not stretch the specs on this one, but emulators definitely will. I have paired this with an amazingly thin case and the Razer Kishi controller for the ultimate emulation and streaming beast on the go.My choice came down to price, as I was originally going to go with the Sony Xperia 1 III. That choice also lost me some options in the process such as the awesome 3.5mm jack and DAC combo, and the micro SD slot (I have multiple ranging from 128GB to 1TB for storage away from my server (away from civilization)). Sony is the only top end option for those points but at nearly double the price that I bought the OnePlus 9 Pro at. 256GB of storage will be a little thin for my uses but I can manage.TL;DR - for the price, this is the best top-end phone of 2021.

The device is sold with Oxygen OS (android 11), but a recent update delivered as a ""standard security update"" completely wipes the device, changing the OS to ColorOS (which is inferior and lacks features that Oxygen has).  The user is given zero warning  about this update, and it is sold as simply moving the android security update to the 03/2022 release.  It is infact a complete OS change.Features you lose:1.  Ability to remove some oneplus' bloatware2.  Ability to rename applications/disable3.  Paid apps fail to launch in the new Android 12 ""color os"" (These are up-to-date apps certified to work with Android 12 that fail in OnePlus's junk ColorOS, which is the cannibalized OS used in their Chinese products (brought in when they were purchased/merged with Oppo)4.  The OS lacks substantial features present in in the version this product is sold with. Headphones, camera, and bluetooth audio all failed with legitimate (and previously working) apps.5.  The OTA (over the air) update that changed Oxygen to ColorOS also deleted several personal files (desktop wallpaper, and files in the root of the phone outside standard directories).6.  Battery life is worse after the update as well.  It was already pretty terrible (see other reviews here).  This device drinks power and will require multiple recharges a day if you use the high resolution display / high refresh rate.This is relevant to Amazon purchasers, because you will be sold a device that appears/functions one way, and then magically overnight, an update will cripple the device.  You can revert the update, but it is not trivial (a factory reset will not save you)Amazon will likely delete this review again, even though I am a verified purchaser.  The critique of this phone is fair and honest. If OnePlus cared about its customers, it would address the egregious trust violations in their system update (and acknowledge the horrible battery life of the device).  Instead, Amazon and OnePlus will likely simply continue to delete my review.","April 7, 2022"
"OnePlus 9 Pro Morning Mist, 5G Unlocked Android Smartphone U.S Version,12GB RAM+256GB Storage,120Hz Fluid Display,Hasselblad Quad Camera,65W Ultra Fast Charge,50W Wireless Charge,with Alexa Built-in",paul,4.0,"I got this after using multiple Samsung and Google phones, all of which had their own issues. After using it for some time, here are my impressions with both good and not so good parts.Good parts:- The build quality is good, the phone feels great in hand and has some weight to it, unlike phones like Google Pixel 5 which feels like a cheap toy. You can also watch video by JerryRigEverything, this phone does not bend easily with very strong frame.- The display quality is good, especially pixel density, which is 525 ppi. I have tried phones with lower pixel density such as Pixel 5, they're ok if your vision is good but if you have nearsightedness and have to use phone close to your face you will easily notice individual pixels on phones with lower pixel density. On OnePlus 9 Pro you will not have this issue.- The OS is better than on Samsung phones. It is close to stock, there is no bloat like on Samsung phones, many apps can be uninstalled except apps like Gallery or Netflix. It is close to Pixel phone OS, except the launcher on OnePlus is better than Google's own launcher because you can do more customizations like remove Google search bar (I don't use it) or remove stock widget from home screen (you can't do this on Pixel phones unless you will use different launcher) or do more customizations in terms of adding different icons or changing colors. OnePlus also uses stock Google dialer and messages apps, they are much better than Samsung's apps because they filter spam much better and Google's dialer has integrated visual voicemail (this feature depends on your provider, it works on Verizon but might not work with some other provider) and Google's messages app has support for RCS messaging which you can enable even if your carrier does not want to. You can also customize features such as adding black bar on top of display to hide front camera, something that Samsung used to allow but then they disabled this feature in One UI 3. The OnePlus launcher also looks better from visual point of view compared to Samsung's One UI - Samsung really overdid ""rounded corners"" on every pop-up message box and every menu in their phones, I really dislike it. OnePlus launcher has much less pronounced ""rounded corners"" in menus and message boxes which look better and hopefully something that OnePlus will never change.- The fingerprint reader works good for me, much more reliable than what I have seen on Samsung phones with their under display fingerprint readers. Just be aware that third-party screen protectors may interfere with it.- The cameras produce good photo quality, especially after latest updates. Initially the photo quality was pretty poor as you can see from all old reviews, but OnePlus has released many updates which increased the photo quality to good levels. It's still not as good as on Pixel phones but very close and with more updates will probably get even better.- The battery life is good after all recent updates. Both the standby and use time with display on are pretty good and better than similar models from Samsung. This will probably get even better with more updates by OnePlus.Not so good parts:- The phone is pretty expensive, especially without good trade-in programs. You can find Galaxy S21+ for cheaper price, especially with great trade-in program that Samsung offers.- The phone still has some software bugs which are not fixed, such as bugs with bluetooth which affects some people or bugs with automatic brightness adjustment. All of those will probably fixed with future updates but the phone should not have been released with those bugs.- The phone has SnapDragon 888 processor, it is known for high power consumption which creates high heat output. It affected many phones including phones from Samsung and also affected this model. The manufacturers are still trying to adjust this processor's power consumption in their phones, Samsung already does it well but OnePlus has not reached their level yet. You may still see overheat warnings on this model if you live in a warm climate and do things like filming 4k video at high fps. I personally hasn't experienced it but you may find other examples of it. This is something you need to be aware of before buying it.","June 4, 2021"

I've been using this for over 2 months and here is my review especially when compared to the OP 6 and 7 pro.Design - nice finish, smooth and a bit slippery but I have it in a case now. It's a lot heavier and bulkier than I expected.Display - excellentSound: Speakers - very loud, crystal clear and impressive quality and surround sound.Sound: Earbuds (wired and wireless) - not as good as the OP6 possibly due to the usb-c and wireless (I use sony wired and wireless headsets).Camera - The Hasselblad is excellent quality for near and far images. Excellent photo and video quality.Gaming: very fast and smooth with no visual lagBattery life: less than I expected as I get the same from my OP6 and 7. I was expecting a lot more hours as I have even less apps installed.Dual sim: disappointing. I ordered the US version as I'm in NY an all previous models were dual sim however this US version does not have dual sim. While I understand this to be more due to regulation and not the fault of OP, I think this should be explicitly stated in the title as I now have to use 2 phones and will be giving up this one for the 10 pro this week.Overall performace: good. Phone is fast but not much faster than the OP6 with less cores, RAM and storage.OS: it's ok but nothing to really stand out. The OS and feel are exactly the same as the older models. No exclusive apps but I guess that lessens the bloatware.Call clarity: very goodOverall Pros - display, sound (only via built-in speakers), amazing camera.Overall Cons - bulky, heavy, no dual-sim and less than impressive audio and volume using wired and wireless headsets.I've purchased the OP 10 Pro and will give an opinion compared to the OP6 and OP 9 Pro. Cheers.","August 22, 2022"

The warp charge is insane and charges my phone so fast, I only get one episode of netflix in before i check on it.Battery life - very respectable. Maybe charge it at the end of the day with heavy use.Gaming mode - pretty nice, made Pokemon go look snazzy and phone games popped, while also minimizing battery use.Pro-tip: get a clear backed phone case, because this phone is actually pretty to look at.Disliked the camera, which was a major selling point for this phone. Scenic photos, it's great! Night mode struggles and close-up photos struggle to stay in focus. It's like the phone wants to focus, but doesn't.

Any exposure to moisture (even short term) will affect this phone.  Also - the length of this handy makes it prone to twisting and in my case affected the sound (went from stereo to mono).  You could tell because the slightest twist along the long axis would make stereo sound come back.The latest thing that happened was that it acted up and started to be unresponsive to touch.  Application suddenly opened, random text started appearing, etc; Since it was unresponsive I couldn't stop it from going haywire.Well... it took less than 2 years to realize that I wasted money. At least the wireless charger is still functioning.Original review:Have you ever fallen in love with something only to see the manufacturer discontinue it.  (If you are a Google user then - yes, you would know:-). I was a huge fan of the Nexus phones from Google and it broke my heart when they discontinued the series in favor oF the pixels.  I've been in search of a replacement ever since having tried Samsung, LG and even a Pixel3xl.  The Pixel was nice in the beginning  but endless updates from Google made the phone so unstable that I started looking around again.This One+ 9 Pro is finally the phone I was looking for. Sleek, great screen, fast and once in a proper case, very comfortable to handle (without case it is too slick for me).I got the wireless warp charger for it (~$35) and boy... it charges the phone from 15% to 100% in 20 minutes.  I've never seen anything like that.  The battery lasts me 2 days and I do use it a lot, albeit, probably not as much as the younger generation. The cameras are awesome.  Great quality pictures and videos (without jerking).The only thing that I wonder about is the update frequency of the OS.  It's been almost 6 months since Android 12 was released and the manufacturer is still only on 11.  I'd like to think that they do more testing than Google to avoid the problems that caused me to loose faith in the Pixel3XL in the first place.My phone is a version LE2125 (unlocked on Verizon).  Transferring my data from the old phone was a breeze via Bluetooth.(Edit: just a few days later, the android 12 update came down)","March 24, 2022"

What I received was a model number LE2127.  The LE2125 is the factory unlocked model while the LE 2125 is a T-Mobile phone that was unlocked.  First of all, the LE2127 has the T-Mobile bloatware and the T-Mobile boot animation but more importantly, they have different 5G bands and capabilities.  This is shown in the attached image.  The LE2125 is on the left and it supports 9 of the 10 5G bands.  The LE2127 is on the right and it only supports 7 of the 10 5G bands.  (The image shows 17 supported bands for the LE2125 and 8 for the LE2127 but I think the difference is due to bands not available in the US, but I'm not sure).  I wanted the OnePlus 9 Pro with the greatest 5G band compatibility, which is the LE2125, but that is not what I received.On the plus side, the phone is in very nice condition for a refurbished phone and seems to be working as intended.  I'll update this if I notice any other issues.","December 28, 2022"

Elliott,2.0,"I am frequently in places where I don't want the phone to ring and the physical slide switch on the side of this phone was what convinced me to buy this particular phone.  However, the switch does not work - any alarm I have set will cause the phone to sound the audible alarm even when the phone is set to ""silent mode"".  When I set the switch to silent, the phone screen confirms that it is on silent mode, but the alarms still sound.Even if I POWER DOWN the phone, the phone will turn on by itself and sound the alarm tone when the time for the alarm occurs.  Obviously there is no way to actually turn this phone off.  If I could remove the battery I would but that's not practical every time I go into a doctor's office.I have been in contact with tech support and they have not been able to correct this major defect.  In fact, both of the times they made suggestions regarding what to do, their instructions for what to change in my settings do not apply to my phone.  They tell me what screen to go into and what setting to change, but that setting does not exist on my phone.So, zero stars for OnePlus tech support.","February 11, 2023"

Check your RAM you should have 12gb that is US version. If you only have 8gb you have a Chinese version which will work with most carriers in US so it can fool a person. The US version should work with all carriers so if your having issue with it working and can't figure out you prob have Chinese. ..ALSO if you use the Alexa app or smart devices connected to Alexa DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE either version.

Just when you get everything laid out nice...Camera and video is very good.In summary, battery life is a deal killer.  The phone itself is overkill to a large degree factoring in the price.

I had the One Plus 7 Pro and I bought it directly from the OnePlus website. No issues with that one. I cannot recommend anybody in the USA to buy this thing from Amazon.,"October 8, 2022"

"OnePlus 8 Pro Onyx Black,​ 5G Unlocked Android Smartphone U.S Version, 12GB RAM+256GB Storage, 120Hz Fluid Display,Quad Camera, Wireless Charge, with Alexa Built-in",Mark,5.0,"I upgraded to the OnePlus 8 from a Pixel 2XL, and I have thoroughly enjoyed this phone so far! I was a little hesitant buying this phone (with some complaining about the camera, and so many other phones releasing this fall), but this phone has surpassed my expectations! I wasn't interested in the OnePlus 8 Pro because of the larger size/weight and more expensive price tag. The OnePlus 8 is close to the size of my Pixel 2XL, which is big enough for me. Personally, I don't really care about wireless charging or water resistance. Also, I read the pro has a more prominent waterfall screen (the screen wraps around the sides of the phone more), which I was not interested in.The screen is big and beautiful! The hole punch camera doesn't bother me at all, and I forget it is there most of the time. The 90hz screen was a huge selling point for me, and is a huge upgrade from a 60hz screen. It really makes the phone feel buttery smooth.Speaking of buttery smooth, this phone will handle anything you throw at it! The combination of the beefy specs (emphasis on the 8gb/12 gb of RAM) and OxygenOS make for an amazing experience. I am not a big mobile gamer, but I did try PUBG to check out the 90 fps mode, which works and gameplay is smooth/fluid.The battery life has been fantastic. It will definitely get though an entire day with heavy usage. The included 30w fast charger will charge up your phone super quick if you are in a rush. The phone also has battery optimization options that will help prevent the battery from degrading overtime.The on-screen fingerprint reader is very fast and I rarely have issues unlocking the phone. I have not tried face recognition, because I just prefer the fingerprint reader.The stereo speakers are pretty great, and I have no issues with the sound quality. I mostly use Bluetooth Bose earbuds with the phone, and haven't had any connection issues at all.The build quality is very premium and feels like a $1000 phone. Hepatic feedback (vibration) is something people overlook in reviews, and it feels great and is subtle. The power and volume buttons also feel nice and clicky. The power button on the Pixel 2 XL felt spongy, and sometimes wouldn't even register me pressing it (it was super annoying). The notification slider (ring/vibrate/silent) is useful and should be on more Android phones. The glass back also makes the phone feel premium, but it is super slippery. It is also a fingerprint magnet (interstellar glow). So maybe slap a case or a D-Brand skin on the back (although the interstellar glow looks beautiful).In my opinion, the camera is not nearly as bad as some people are saying. It still takes high quality photos, and software updates will only make it better. It isn't as easy as the pixel 2XL's camera and camera software, but it has potential! It definitely isn't on par with the OnePlus 8 pro or other $1000 phones, but it gets the job done. I am definitely not a photographer or photography enthusiast, so if you are looking for a phone that takes the best photos, maybe go with the OnePlus 8 pro. Also, the 2MP macro camera on this phone is pretty pointless (which may be my only negative point in this review). I know some people were having issues with the selfie camera (reports of blurry/fuzzy images), but I haven't had any problems with it so far.Overall, this is exactly the phone I wanted. A super fast phone (high specs and 90hz screen) that I didn't pay $1000+ for. I will never be able to go back to a phone with a 60hz screen!","September 3, 2020"
"OnePlus 8 Pro Onyx Black,​ 5G Unlocked Android Smartphone U.S Version, 12GB RAM+256GB Storage, 120Hz Fluid Display,Quad Camera, Wireless Charge, with Alexa Built-in",Dylan Whisnant,5.0,"This is my second Oneplus smartphone as I’m moving from the 6 to 8 and I’ve found a home with OnePlus. It may not have the name recognition in the USA that some of the other well-known brands do (Apple, Samsung, LG, Motorola, etc.) but now that more carriers are starting to adopt the brand in the states (Verizon & T-Mobile) it’s only a matter of time before it’s mentioned in the same breath as the Iphone or a galaxy. It has already topped many of the best phones of 2020 lists and for good reason. This phone is a beast, plain and simple. Whatever you throw at it, it can handle it plus more. Navigation in buttery smooth with a 90hz refresh rate screen. It’s got all the hardware you want under the hood with the latest Snapdragon processor on the market, 12GB of memory and 256GB of storage in the model I went with. It runs Android 10 with OxygenOS 10 UI which has always been good about giving the user great performance without shoving bloatware down your throat (it’s there but not in your face) They went away from the notch on the 6 and moved to a hole punch selfie camera on the 8 which really opens up the screen space.  The rear cameras are high-powered topping out at 48MP and takes superb pictures and videos. The 4300 mAh battery has already lasted me a complete day and some change including a twelve-hour shift at work as an IT professional when I’m constantly using my phone to perform tasks. The warp charger is insanely fast as I can go to empty to a full charge in about 45 minutes. What it lacks, I don’t miss. The headphone jack is no more from the 6 but most all phones have said goodbye to that relic from yesteryear. I don’t want to pay a premium for an IP68 rating (just get a SUPCASE Unicorn Beetle case and thank me later) nor do I care about wireless charging. If those things are important to you, pay the extra $100-200 and upgrade to the OnePlus 8 Pro. While the phone is 5g capable, unless you’re on T-Mobile, you will likely only see 4G LTE if you’re like me (AT&T) since the device is ahead of the carriers in terms of coverage and compatibility. The best Android experience around all at an affordable price point in the top tier of flagship devices. This is the smartphone you want. Don’t hesitate and purchase with supreme confidence.Pros• Smooth 90hz refresh rate• Snapdragon 865• 256GB of Storage and 12GB of memory• GSM Unlocked (AT&T, T-Mobile, etc)• Fast 30w WARP charging• 5G capable• Great picture quality• In screen fingerprint reader• Price is still exceptional compared to other flagship phones with similar specsCons• No IP68 dust/water resistant rating• Storage not expandable• No headphone jack• Lacks wireless charging• 5G currently only compatible on T-Mobile","June 17, 2020"
"OnePlus 8 Pro Onyx Black,​ 5G Unlocked Android Smartphone U.S Version, 12GB RAM+256GB Storage, 120Hz Fluid Display,Quad Camera, Wireless Charge, with Alexa Built-in",Mark,5.0,"I've been a Pixel person for many years now, but didn't have many options for an unlocked phone with near stockish Android and decent battery life.I will start by saying the phone doesn't have Alexa installed and it isn't required. Anyone giving it a poor review for that is misinformed.This phone seemed to be a better fit than a newer Pixel, but I was concerned with camera quality. The photos I've taken look really great and the camera app is very similar to the others I've used. I've taken several hundred pics since owning the phone and they have turned out almost as good (in some cases even better) than the ones taken with my Pixel 2 XL.I've installed all of my apps and been using it heavily and it gets significantly better battery life than my other phones. This was a big complaint and one of my primary reasons to upgrade. The screen on the 8 is really bright in Auto and adjusts well to surrounding light. Leaving the phone to adjust automatically has been fine most of the time and I rarely change it myself.The Warp Charging is absolutely amazing. Plugging it in for a short amount of time charges the battery up enough to use for hours. This wasn't really a huge selling point for me, but it did make me quite happy when I used it.The build quality and looks are impressive too. It just feels like a premium phone. The Interstellar Glow is an interesting color choice and it looks sogood in person. Any clear case will show off it's iridescent shine.Software has been a big win here. The simplicity of stock Android has always been appealing to me and getting away from that has been hard. You don't realize how much you were missing until you start using something like Oxygen OS on a OnePlus phone. You can change the icons on the entire phone with icon packs downloaded from Play Store. You can change the status bar, system icons, the color and shapes. So many things can be customized and it is so smooth.I was worried that I would spend the money to be let down, but this has been a great purchase. I'm happy with it and can't say enough good things about my new phone.","June 8, 2020"

It has smart charge software control, can prolong charging for less heat. Battery life is good.Con: Some cons are subjective as compared to my previous phone (Huawei Mate 20)Fingerprint is on screen, less sensitive than my old phone which had dedicated finger print sensor behind the phone.Battery life seems less than my old phone, this is strange since Oneplus 8 has high endurance rating than the Mate 20. Could also due to Kirin chipset throttling better at power management.Oxygen OS has some quirks, just need to play with the settings e.g. default messaging app has MMS turned off for group texting. It would send individual sms to each recipient by default, or no way to close default music app locked in top notification bar without force stop.Heat dissipation/distribution: During initial setup, notice Oneplus 8 heat felt in one region of the phone. My old phone distribute and dissipate heat better. This is only a concern under intense usage, no heat issue during normal usage.No 3.5mm jack.No memory card slot.Speaker: playing music has tiny distortion from the vibration of the back plate. This effect is little, only affects certain type of music.Overall is good deal for the price.","February 11, 2022"
"OnePlus 8 Pro Onyx Black,​ 5G Unlocked Android Smartphone U.S Version, 12GB RAM+256GB Storage, 120Hz Fluid Display,Quad Camera, Wireless Charge, with Alexa Built-in",Weaze the Wize,5.0,"This phone has been a workhorse.  It was a solid week after I received it before I put a SIM card in it and started carrying it because I needed the time to modify and secure it, and test it to be certain it WAS secure and would not spy on me.The phone, out of the box, cooperated with my efforts to modify it.  It was not filled with bloatware to begin with, but also could be easily rooted and then modded at a deep level...many brands (*koff samsung*) fight you on this.  I have now been carrying it for almost 3 years and it has functioned perfectly.Camera is very good.  Not the best I guess but certainly good enough for me.I run the battery between 75% charge and 35% charge which is good enough to take me through the day (given that my mods keep all the spyware from running) and consequently the battery has shown no signs of deterioration.I was a bit leery of a chinese phone, which the OnePlus certainly is, but I have encountered no trouble controlling it and it does not contain any hidden spyware or backdoors.I'm a software developer and expert in pretty much all aspects of the technologies that you need to understand in order to understand, analyze, monitor, and control these phones, so if there was something untoward going on I would know about it by now.I recommend the OnePlus brand based on my experience with this device.  If nothing has changed with later phones, this brand is an excellent deai.","June 25, 2024"
"OnePlus 8 Pro Onyx Black,​ 5G Unlocked Android Smartphone U.S Version, 12GB RAM+256GB Storage, 120Hz Fluid Display,Quad Camera, Wireless Charge, with Alexa Built-in",Gregory S.,5.0,"I'll just begin by saying this is the best device on the planet. Obviously, it's bro is due very soon. However, it will remain at the top of any list this year and beyond. I do not purchase devices based on cameras or camera performance. So, my review pertains to its strength based on its purpose, and performance, as a phone. I understand that may not be a popular position, and it doesn't mean that I won't mention camera functionality. Here's my short. Its display is brilliant. Colors are excellently saturated, and it produces a three dimensional picture. Sometimes, I think it's more entertaining watching videos, and movies, on my devices. I can't say that it's a result of its 120-hertz refresh rate. Honestly, many 60-hertz displays can easily challenge the 8 Pro. I believe that the One Plus engineers are invaluable in this industry. It does have a new motion processor that is fun to use. This is different from the refresh rate. I appreciate it, and I'm not aware of any other phone that exists with that technology. I may be wrong. A few apps support this processing, such as Netflix, Prime and YouTube. It definitely sets itself apart from other devices on the market. Dolby Atmos audio speaker performance is great. I wish that manufacturers would revert back to front firing speakers. Thinking about those Pixel 2XL days. However, stereo separation is great from it's ear and downfiring speakers. Phone performance is great. I have no issues with calls or its 5G performance. I have to say that their Oxygen OS software is a step above stock Droid. Its Snapdragon chip is very good. Gaming is also good with very little video or audio lag. I Iike it's gaming processing. What I mean is it shuts down many other functions while it processes your choice of games. At times, it may get warm when gaming or watching videos. As with any other device, you can take proper steps to allow to cool, or not.Camera and video performance are good to excellent for those of you that appreciate camera capabilities. In my opinion, there aren't many devices on the market that are bad camera performers. Unless, you're a cameraphile, the average consumer will be just fine. If you've never owned a One Plus device, you will be pleasantly surprised with their performance. It's been fun. I highly recommend this device.","March 17, 2021"

Not only that but their customer support and clearly from the post on the forums their actual warranty service is horrid.For those still reading my boring rant here are my issues that I've encountered:1. Wifi Dropout issue. A quick search will show this is widespread. Android 11 fixed the dropout in some of my areas of my house. That said it made it worse in the areas that it didn't fix.2. Rattling vibration motor that is somehow fixed with a restart. This seems less common but is truly odd. The haptic motor that you feel every time you type will randomly get really really bad and feel super odd about once every couple of days and last until restart. Super odd3. Notifications that show up hours after they have been delivered. Never encountered on any other of my other androids4. SMS/MMS Group chats only work about sometimes. I've heard about this issue on other androids but have never experienced it personally. This phone simply refuses to deliver group chat text messages randomly.5. Display issues as others have mentioned at certain brightness levels6. (Subjective) Android 11s skin is not that great. It's clearly a rip off of Samsung. That was one of the reasons I left Samsung after the Note 10+. I just found their skin too cartoonish and their colors off. I personally find similar with this new skin.7. Battery life is horrid after android 118. Misc. small issues that don't warrant a section but are still annoying.Thanks for reading. I hope you got some form of enjoyment or info out of this.

It charges fast with my old OnePlus 30w Brick, the camera is great, storage is fantastic, wireless charging is awesome and I dont have to worry about wearing out the usb C port as fast. The menus, user interface, and overall build of the phone seem to be very solid so far.I havent experienced any of the green tint issues that were happening with this phone for other users last year and hoping that doesnt pop up at some point.My two gripes at the moment are cell signal and bluetooth. I work in a building with a metal roof pretty far from a cell tower but with my OnePLus 6T I never had less than 4 bars, calls were clear, and I never missed a call, text, etc.Since switching to the OnePlus 8 Pro my cell signal is significantly worse. No one can hear me while I'm inside the building anymore, sometimes I even wont receive calls until the last ring and by then the caller hangs up. I am using the same sim card as I was before on the same network as before. My APN is set correctly so it's definitely a phone issue.Bluetooth: While music will play through the car, earbuds, speakers no problem and at a decently loud volume, bluetooth calls however are terribly quiet. I never had any of these issues with my OnePlus 6T but in my vehicle I have to turn my phone and vehicles volumes to max to even barely hear the person on the other end, same with my bluetooth ear piece. Again music plays fine, audio calls do not. I have not found any changeable settings that allow me to correct his and it still is an issue at the moment.

"OnePlus 8 Pro Onyx Black,​ 5G Unlocked Android Smartphone U.S Version, 12GB RAM+256GB Storage, 120Hz Fluid Display,Quad Camera, Wireless Charge, with Alexa Built-in",Mark,4.0,"This is my first Oneplus phone, I opted for the non-pro version because of the slightly smaller screen, and the fact that the hardware specs I care about were identical on both (90hz is more than enough for me, and going from 60hz to 90hz is much more important than 90hz to 120hz). It's definitely fast and powerful, and in terms of running apps smoothy, is as good as any flagship Samsung or iPhone right now.The main con for me is that there's no external storage options, which is the one thing I miss the most from the S10e I replaced this with. The 256GB version certainly comes with enough storage, but I definitely miss the convenience of being able to pop the card out from one phone and put it in the other and keep all my music and pictures on it without having to sync to anything.My other main issue has to do with the OS. There's a volume slider on the side, which is fine, but you can't actually put the phone on vibrate or silent in the software itself, which really sucks since most of the cases for this phone so far require you to dig your finger in there and basically claw at your phone to silence it.My other gripes are more with the industry as a whole right now which this phone copied, so they are problems with pretty much any good phone right now. Curved screens might look cool but they are actually a spectacular pain to use, especially if you are using apps that require touches at the very edges of the screen, not to mention putting screen protectors on them is also a huge pain. Also I'm a guy with big hands and I can barely use this thing one handed, most apps don't even support the ridiculously long 6.5 inch screen anyway, so it's not like things even look better on it. This might be mitigated if the OS offered a good one handed mode options, but you are stuck with whatever is on the play store if you want to attempt that with this OS.I like the phone enough that I'll definitely consider Oneplus phones in another couple of years when I might upgrade again though (I like it overall better than Samsung that I have my own gripes with), I just hope OP offers a version with a smaller, flat screen, and adds external storage options, and it would be almost a completely perfect phone.","May 10, 2020"

Until I found out that the 5MP color filter camera lens is just a placebo. There is a feature that we all pay for as part of this $900 (plus) price tag that we are not getting.One feature, and the only feature that uses this lens is the Photochrom feature. I have come to find that after some public complaints about this photo feature they have disabled it and now the camera lens is just sitting there having no purpose and we are paying for this hardware in the cost of the phone.I certainly will be searching for others that are complaining about this and join in with them in whatever solutions they have come up with. But it is in my best interest to not pay for things I do not receive.I'm sure this feature has an added cost of possibly hundreds of dollars and if we are being denied the use of it we should be compensated by OnePlus for having removed it. They should refund us for the feature and they should reduce the ongoing cost of the phone accordingly.In fact they are still advertising the feature even though it doesn't exist on their web page. In the specifications for this phone it states a 5MP color filter camera lens. It doesn't state a 5MP unused camera lens. It is supposed to be present specifically for the Photochrom photo filter feature that is no longer present.There are other quirks that I can mention about this phone but compared to being charged for things I cannot use is bad enough.Amazon has been very good about everything though. They have been very helpful. The first one I received had an issue where there was no response to touch on the screen and they promptly replaced it for me. Great job Amazon. Thanks.","June 21, 2020"
"OnePlus 8 Pro Onyx Black,​ 5G Unlocked Android Smartphone U.S Version, 12GB RAM+256GB Storage, 120Hz Fluid Display,Quad Camera, Wireless Charge, with Alexa Built-in",Bma4506,4.0,"Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone. Your mileage may vary in that opinion, but I figured I should update this review","May 12, 2020"
"OnePlus 8 Pro Onyx Black,​ 5G Unlocked Android Smartphone U.S Version, 12GB RAM+256GB Storage, 120Hz Fluid Display,Quad Camera, Wireless Charge, with Alexa Built-in",Lyndon,5.0,I originally got this phone in June and I wanted to use it or over a month to generate honest opinions. First off Alexa is not pre-installed you have to manually install it. Secondly the Amazon OnePlus 8 does not come with a clear case included in the box. Now that I got those out of the way this phone is amazing it's really fast has an amazing screen though some people say they have green tint issues I have not experienced that on my unit. The software or oxygen OS is very fast and very reminiscent of stock Android though there are some pre-installed apps such as Netflix and Facebook installer but you are able to uninstall Facebook. The screen is beautiful and pretty big and that 90 Hz makes a huge difference from 60 Hz. I showed this to my friends and family and they were blown away with how fast it was. The camera on this phone gets a bad rap from people for some unknown reason because I've used this and it's the best camera of ever used on a phone apart from the 2mp macro camera that is only useful for gimmicky purposes. I actually had a better experience with the main camera zoomed in two times than the macro camera. Battery life on this phone with my usage is amazing I watch a lot of YouTube and scroll through social media every once in awhile and play simple games and I get a day and a half to two days of battery life. Even if the battery life wasn't amazing the warp charge 30t charges my phone from 0% to 70% in 30 minutes. The downsides of this phone are losing out on some flagship creature comforts such as wireless charging an official IP rating and a telephoto camera. Honestly this phone in a $699 package is a great value it includes all of the flagship features you need and cuts the stuff you don't. I bragged about this phone constantly and convinced my family members to switch from their iPhones to this phone.,"August 27, 2020"

The One Plus version of Android is a superior experience compared to Samsung. It is less convoluted and more streamlined in various ways. You simply have to experience it first hand as it is hard to convey in words. Every aspect of this phone can be summed up as ""fast"". The feel of the phone in your hand is a very dense, premium feel that neither an iPhone or Galaxy phone can come close to matching with very intuitive button placement. The One Plus 8 Pro makes every other phone feel cheap in comparison. The screen will attract attention from everyone as nothing else on the market can run a screen at 1440p resolution with a 120mhz refresh rate enabled - not even $1,400 dollar phones. The colors have to be seen to be believed. This is a next generation screen that everyone has to catch up to next year. The camera photos are every bit as beautiful as the high end Galaxies and Apple phones. You will not feel cheated in this area. Plus, it performs up close Macro shots that show a level of detail on objects unlike anything to date. One Plus delivers Android updates months ahead of the competition. There simply aren't any weak areas. This isn't a phone with downsides. I can't believe this phone exceeded my expectations in all areas but it did. I have no problem giving it this level of praise. This is beyond a solid device - it raises the bar. My friends who own S20 Ultra phones and Pro Max Apple phones are impressed and do not hesitate to say so. This phone would sell itself if there were demo units in physical retail stores. Nothing else can challenge it. Do not over think this and buy this phone for yourself and your loved ones. You will feel like a whole new world has opened up to you. I can't go back to any other phone manufacturer after experiencing such a smooth, intelligently designed product!","August 24, 2020"
"OnePlus 8 Pro Onyx Black,​ 5G Unlocked Android Smartphone U.S Version, 12GB RAM+256GB Storage, 120Hz Fluid Display,Quad Camera, Wireless Charge, with Alexa Built-in",Robb,2.0,"The overall phone itself is a good phone, especially for the price. That said, it has some glaring issues that shoot it in the foot, and I can't recommend it to basically anyone, especially not at $900.Pros:- Amazing battery life. Probably the best of any of the ""standard"" flagships.- Beautiful screen. The colors are great (outside of some small issues I'll mention below), it's crisp, and the 120hz is really nice.- Standard flagship specs, with a top end SoC, more RAM than a phone should ever really need, and a ton of storage.- Cheap for a flagship. Even though it's $900, it undercuts most of the competition. It's more expensive than older models, but it's got good specs on paper.- Good front camera position. The back one is a bit weird with how long it is, but the front punchout camera on the front is positioned very nicely. Unlike some of Samsung's models that have it right smack in the middle, OnePlus chose to put it to the side, and I personally think that's a great design decision.Cons:- The screen does have a bit of the tinting issues you might notice (frequently mentioned in reviews), but it's easy to adjust to and only really affects lower brightness settings.- Curved screen. I've never liked these a whole lot, and the One Plus is super sharply curved. Less a con and more a preference, but I leave it here because I disliked it.- The deal breaker: the glass. I'm inclined to believe I may have gotten a bad model, but I did a quick search and there's been at least a handful of other people who have had the issue. The phone uses Gorilla Glass 5 on the front, the same that most phones have for years. Every time GG ups a number, it's usually a little less scratch resistant but more shatter proof. However, this is the same as my previous phone, the Pixel 3XL. That phone is over two years old and has no scratches on it. I haven't been the nicest with it either; it's been slid along rough wood, dropped in dirt, stepped on at least once by accident, clawed by pets. And there is 0 scratching. I removed the screen protector on the OnePlus because I'm pretty careful; most of those were occasional accidents and I figured it would be fine, because I don't like the screen protector texture. Within a week of having the OnePlus 8, I started seeing scratching along the curve of the screen. Within 3 weeks, it had half a dozen small but pretty deep scratches and one very big one. I had the same case that I had on the Pixel (Spiggen's Tough Armor), and the glass on the Pixel had definitely seen it's share of use and ""scratching"" in terms of contact. It's the same glass, supposedly, and yet one was getting trashed in a fraction of the time. I can't say if it was a flawed model or what, but things that aren't harder than glass shoudlnt scratch it, and the Pixel had seen a *lot* more abuse than the OnePlus which I was babying. I hadn't dropped it at all, I only set it facedown maybe three times total, it was always alone in my pocket when it was there. I'm tempted to believe it was defective but I don't know. Either way, I've returned the phone but I thought I should share my experience.","October 15, 2020"
"OnePlus 8 Pro Onyx Black,​ 5G Unlocked Android Smartphone U.S Version, 12GB RAM+256GB Storage, 120Hz Fluid Display,Quad Camera, Wireless Charge, with Alexa Built-in",Hayden,5.0,"Wow, pros: Everything.  Super fast, long battery life, great pure android experience (no bloat wear), sound is fantastic, screen is fantastic.  I'm not a huge picture taker, but it all looks great to me in zoom or low light - things that other phones usually don't get right at all.  Love the vivid colors options and the finger print reader is best I've used.  It captures the whole finger print, so you can touch it off axis with no problems.  I compared to a 8t+ (my sons) and I did notice a difference in battery life and speed from the DDR5 vs. DDR4 memory.  Other than that both phones are about identical in RAM/ROM, etc.  Also, it does inductance charging which I love.  I keep a charge stand on my bedside table and desk.  Battery life is exceptional.  You really can charge it up and use it off and on throughout the day to call, email, stream, and surf the web on a single charge.  It is water resistant rated vs. just actually being water resistant but not rated, which I like and trust more.  Wifi hookup is very fast and 5G is insane.  Easily 500+mbs on T-Mobile all over town.  I have had it fall back to 4G LTE in some places like steel framed buildings.Cons:  Honesty, none so far.  I do like the standard back/home/open apps task bar vs gestures (default) but found it in settings ad switched it and that fixed that.  Gestures work as advertised but I just can't get used to them, especially the back gesture.Overall, I cant rave enough about this phone.  Especially if you get it used or renewed and save big bucks.Highly recommend.","February 28, 2021"
"OnePlus 8 Pro Onyx Black,​ 5G Unlocked Android Smartphone U.S Version, 12GB RAM+256GB Storage, 120Hz Fluid Display,Quad Camera, Wireless Charge, with Alexa Built-in",Hayden,3.0,"I upgraded from a OnePlus 7 pro. I gotta say this phone is so lovely to use. It's hundreds less than s20+ and yet it is much better in my opinion. Cleaner ui close to stock Android with neat customizations. The display color accuracy is superb, I love how I can enable qhd and 120hz all while getting a good battery life with brightness at 75%. I use the phone daily throughout the day to web browse, watch YouTube, text, stream from Netflix Hulu etc, music with bluetooth, wifi mostly on all day and it's solid.Next the build is very excellent and that's how it should be for 1000 dollars.The cameras, the main sensor is super crisp, the wide angle is also quite sharp, and same goes for telephoto, the macro photography is actually super insane in this phone. It focuses so quickly across all cameras, the colors are super vivid and bright with nice contrast and I love how I can get insanely close to a subject and it still focuses without issues at all. Now I never really used much of the 30x zoom but it seems good and it can be useful to see things from far away. The selfie camera is good but I don't really care for the face smoothing. The overall camera quality is so good like for sure flagship level.The face unlock, fingerprint scanner are super quick and reliable. Works all the time. All the amazing features listed are so sick and work all the time! This phone is a beast. It's a phone that just works so I don't feel like I need to say much more.Now the only issue with this phone is the display. After just a day of use I started seeing image retention and burn in and it gradually got more noticeable as the weeks went on. At very low brightness there is a black bar/line that runs across from home punch camera but I don't really mind that because it's only visible from 0- like 30% ish brightness. It's the image retention that worries me for long term use. I personally have tried two units one from Amazon and OnePlus directly and both had the same issues. I didn't want to take the risk so I returned. I wouldn't recommend this phone with that display issue but if your unit is good then that's awesome.","August 31, 2020"

Super fast. I don't even need to speed up Animations in the Developer Options. Excellent battery. Great dual speakers. I do miss the headphone jack but I had a dongle (USB C → 3.5 headphone jack). It's my first time using Oxygen OS and although it's not as refined as One UI 2.0 (Samsung's skin), maybe that's why it's so snappy. The microphone is also not as great as my S10e but does the job. The camera is fine.About 5G capabilities. With AT&T, 5G works on my iPhone 12 mini bought UNLOCKED but WILL NOT WORK ON OP8 with AT&T.OnePlus is great. Nice and light. I don't favor curved screens (I realized and have enjoyed S10e, Note 20, 12 Mini) since hands are not large. Also why I prefer 12 mini or Note 20 (where Samsung One UI allows for resizing apps simply by pulling from top corner, whereas vanilla android OS, not my flavor, realized).But OnePlus ""skin"" called Oxygen OS is wonderful! If you're a true android fan and enjoy warp charge, slider (like on iPhone) for sound off/onno headphone jack, no wireless charge, quickest Android OS updates, Oxygen OS features like gestures on screen-off, then this is the phone for you.Volume keys on the left side and then the slider and power button on the right side.[On the off-chance you're wondering- iPhone 12, volume and silent toggle on the left, and power button on the right.And for the Note 20 5G, annoyingly, nothing on left side and volume and power on the right side. ]","July 5, 2020"

Feels way better to use though.Cons:Slow updates! SO SLOW wow!!!My screen definitely has the green tint issues on greys in very specific lighting conditions, and the Android 11 update did not help it by adding that bad shade of grey that used to be only in the youtube app, to half the OS! Big OOF! It's not bad, and I barely ever notice it, but when I do and it happens, it's all I can notice!No micro SD card or Headphone jack which really sucks.Overally I'm real happy with my purchase, though now it's be best to just wait for the new OP 9 Pro","February 13, 2021"
"OnePlus 8 Pro Onyx Black,​ 5G Unlocked Android Smartphone U.S Version, 12GB RAM+256GB Storage, 120Hz Fluid Display,Quad Camera, Wireless Charge, with Alexa Built-in",Dylan Whisnant,5.0,"I came from a galaxy s7 to oneplus 8.  What a world of difference.  I know I was using a 4 year old phone, but wow, this thing is so much faster.  Literally everything I do happens in a fraction of the time my old dinosaur s7 took.  The 90hz display is awesome, and smooth as butter.  Thank you oneplus for not dumping a dozen useless trash apps into the phone like other companies do...cough..samsung...cough.  Not buying from the carrier saved me another dozen useless apps..cough..tmobile...cough.  The UI is great, coming from garbage touchwiz.  I feel like I finally have a good phone.  It has a minor issue that oneplus could improve upon.  I miss having an always on display.  The oneplus 8 has kind of a half-azzed version of that.  The display will light up for notifications, but only the instant you get them, then the screen returns to darkness.  That is nearly useless since I'm not staring at my phone constantly.  There's also no indicator light to let you know you've gotten notifications.  So basically when you get a notification of any kind, the phone's half on display flashes for about 5 seconds, then goes dark.  You can't tell if you got a notification or not until you either tap the display or pick the phone up(if you have those settings configured).  This really should have been an always on display, and probably still could be if oneplus just changes when it's active.  The battery lasts a long time, more than a day for me.  I'd gladly trade a few % of that to have the always on display.  It charges very fast with warp charge.  I've had no problems with any of the phone's hardware or software.  Overall, great fast phone.","July 1, 2020"

Do I really need to say the 120Hz is absolutely stunning?!-Speakers are LOUD, honestly did not expect the level they produce, they are by no means audiophile but they do a good job.-Responsiveness to touch is next level, I've used Apple's and Samsung's flagships, and I really enjoy the  smoothness of transitions between applications, faster than the competitors I have tried.-Oxygen OS is by far one of my favorites of the phone, it's lightweight and not bogged down by anything.-Games run very smooth!-Battery life is pretty amazing, 4500mah last a LONG timeCons-Some people may be turned off that by default Netflix comes installed on the phone(Though the HDR on it is AMAZING LOOKING)-Transitioning from an Apple or Samsung may leave some software features to desire, possibly UI issues you do not like.  However there is a great deal of customization with this phone so it has never been an issue with me.ALEXA-Alexa DOES NOT COME INSTALLED BY DEFAULT, PLEASE STOP DOWN VOTING FOR A PHONE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE.-That being said if you want alexa, it's in the app store, if not you're set!Conclusion-This phone was controversial in a that it was a flagship, from a company that has historically against flagships.

And to put salt on the wound, I finally got the package today, only to reveal a standard 8 in Interstellar Glow. Not sure who screwed up here, but I'm just letting anyone interested know that getting theses phones in your hands is a process right now.Will update once I finally get the correct device.Update:Received the correct phone within the same week. Amazon guarantees that you will receive the correct item within 3-5 business days of receiving the returned item, which seems to happen even if it's out of stock. They must have some in reserve just in case. Say what you will about Amazon, but their customer service is top notch.If you're deciding between ordering off of OnePlus's website vs Amazon, definitely go Amazon for their service and accountability. Stock still seems to be an issue, so if you're willing to wait a month or so for that to steady, I'm sure you will encounter a much smoother experience than I did.The phone itself absolutely flies, and the ultramarine is straight up gorgeous. Quite an upgrade from my chugging Galaxy S8. However, no phone is worth the $400+ price premium gougers are charging when out of stock; the wait will be worth it.Overall, I'd rate everything a 3.5, but Amazon doesn't do half stars.","May 11, 2020"

I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already.","June 21, 2020"

Specs are the best out there and OnePlus consistently releases updates no less than monthly to make the experience better. Oh and Alexa does not come preinstalled on the phone. And no I don't have any green tint issues.Pros:- Phone is fast. No lag.- Screen is beautiful ❤️- Oxygen OS is nice. Some say new OS11 looks too much like Samsung One UI and doesn't have stock Android feel anymore. I like OS11.- Good battery life- 5G, VoLTE, WiFi Calling works well (on Google Fi)- Good speaker- Phone exterior is beautiful. The 🔵 is unique.Cons:- Camera is hit or miss. Some pictures are crystal clear. Others are blurry. Not sure if it's device or user error. My Pixel 3XL (previous phone) takes better photos.- Using phone outdoors during summer in 100+ degree weather caused overheating notifications and usage was limited. I don't recall having this issue with other devices. This was problematic for me because it was 100+ degrees almost every day in the summer. So if you live in a hot area and find yourself outdoors for a long period of time, be aware.Overall, I am happy with the phone. Hopefully future updates continue to improve the camera.","December 11, 2020"

I also got this at a price that was nearly $300 off the regular price which made it easy to select this.  I've read the 9 and 10 models aren't as good as the 8 and I was not going to pay full price for a newer phone.

We have a remote property and my previous phone could not capture the internet and could not even make calls but the One Plus 8 Pro overcame this obstacle. The service out there is not perfect but I can make calls, download files, etc. Sometime there is lag. No problems in urban areas except that on occasion there is some lag in the scroll feature but this is not a huge annoyance to me, maybe for others, (after all, it is a thousand dollar device)! Color is great and I am still checking out the camera as I am only into week two with this phone. Lucky for me, I am not a fan of fingerprint readers but I gave it a try and encountered multiple failures, so I gave up on that. After giving up, I opted for a screen protector called ""glass helmet"" and I highly recommend this for a phone like the One Plus that has a curved edge. The protector is applied as a liquid and covers the phone perfectly, for a measly 20 bucks. I read tons of reviews and research before choosing the One Plus 8 Pro and I still think it is one of the very best of what is out there at this moment in marketing time.","July 30, 2020"

This phone is certified by AT&T in US so it worked out of the box when I inserted my SIM card (it sets the APN automatically). It uses VoLTE but not VoWiFi (I think AT&T doesn't support it). It gets 5G in Dallas, Texas but the connection is sporadic. For AT&T 5G, it uses the n5 band but none of the mmWave bands (n260 and n261), which are for very high speeds. My Xiaomi 11 phone that uses the same AT&T 5G band connects to 5G in more areas in Dallas. Compared to OnePlus 8 Pro, it has less storage, no wireless charging, and no 120Hz display, which are not important to me. Surprisingly, the fingerprint reader, which is on screen, works very well. It took 1 hour to charge the battery from 1% to 100% using the 30W charger. It has a great display (curved at the edges which I thought was nice), fast response, light, not bloated with apps.

I took the phone to Verizon to have them activate it etc. It was not near as smooth a process as I had hoped it would be. I've had the phone about a month now and my only real complaints in the beginning was the process of getting it activated and the built in alexa funtionality and the built in Alexa functionality was VERY important to me and the ONLY reason I bought an unlocked phone rather than getting one directly from my cell provider. However, here recently I've also been having issues where the on screen keyboard does not go away when its suppose to.Built in Alexa functionality:  It rarely triggers via the keyword the first time I say it. It usually takes 2-3 times. When it does trigger I get the message ""cannot connect to network"" a lot when at home and the phone is usually only 6 feet or so from my router and i have the Netgear Nighthawk AX8 AX6000 router and do not notice any network issues with any of my other devices.I don't know if the Alexa issues are phone related or Amazon related and I've never had an Alexa built in phone before to compare my experience too.

To me it isn't worth the extra money for more storage. To someone else it might be with the money for that upgrade. This is my 4th OnePlus device. Definitely the best. Right off I'm impressed with the 5G signal I get from the T-Mobile network. With just a bar or 2 signal strength it's like full strength 4G. No problem at all sending or receiving pictures with that weak signal.The other thing to mention is how much fun the camera is to play with (if you have time). I've taken a few hours one day to go through different features: slow-mo, time lapse, color filter, panarama, 48 megapixel, and 12 megapixel. If you don't have time to play with settings in camera it will still simply take a great shot.The bigger battery is nice. A normal day for me at work would be that I listen to music on Bluetooth headphones for about 6 hours, normal check or send a few messages, gander through news headlines at lunch and still have over 60% battery at the end of day.The software from OnePlus is really good because it allows you to set different things for your own taste.

I had a OnePlus 6T and I had zero complains on it. But I was enticed in trying the true stock Android experience and after 1 year of use, I switched to Pixel 4XL. God what a mistake that was. After 3 warranty replacements, I couldn't wait for trading in that phone to buy OnePlus 8T. Traded in with Amazon and then I had to decide between OnePlus 8 Pro and OnePlus 8T. One has the flat screen as advantage. Other has the excellent camera. I chose the Camera over flat screen.Other than surviving the edge, I'm 100% happy with this phone. Hopefully, I want to updated to OnePlus 9 Pro if it doesn't have an edge. After all, I'm an every year buyer.PS: Do not buy this phone if you cannot see a phone in-person which has curved edges.

Wish I could make 48MP the default, unimpressed with the 12MP mode.Screen is beautiful, bright, and smooth. Wish they were flat edges instead of curved.

If I reconnect, it would sometime still drop off automatically. I tried this with another modem, same issue. The last thing I want to say is the fingerprint scanner. I understand that it requires a strong bright light for this to work under the screen. However, it is very disturbing at night or using this phone in a car at night. It would make you blind for a second. I mean if this phone is priced at $599 or $499, I would be okay with this phone. The iPhone 11 256GB starts at $849.Pros: Charing is fast. (I guess iPhone with QC2.0 could achieve similar but slower charing speed)Cons: Everything above.","August 4, 2020"

I had the 7 Pro- nothing wrong with it yet with T-Mobile's inferior 4G network I couldn't reliably connect in a kitty of places.After seeing their extensive 5G network (and loving my $60 monthly for two lines) I wanted to see how I could improve my T-Mobile experience.What a difference (especially after getting a new sim card)! The coverage is outstanding and this phone rocks! The speeds are ridiculously fast and this phone checks all the boxes:- Wireless charging- 120 MHz scrolling- High water resistance rating- Superior battery life- Wireless charge other devices- Great sounding speakers- Larger battery- Warp charger included (and still Warp charges with my 2019 OnePlus Warp car charger)- Ability to clone certain apps (Want to have two Facebook accounts on your phone? Done!)- Excellent photos- Unlocked and always timely Android updates from OnePlusThere is so much more- all at a price which is hundreds less than flagship Samsung and iPhone phones.I've been a fan since buying my OnePlus 3T...

This is on 120hz fhd as well.Camera is great. Love the super macro function and the night time camera. Coming from a OP3T, so any upgrade is a welcome one. My roommate had a S10+ and this phone seems to pummel the image quality.Charges from 50-100 in about 20~ minutes. Beautiful finish on the phone, keep in mind comes with two screen protectors, they didn't seem too sturdy so I'm planning on getting some tempered ones when they're available. The screen in itself is absolutely gorgeous.Downsides so far, screen edges are kind of difficult to navigate and the in display fingerprint reader feels like a step down from my 3T, definitely not as snappy, maybe I need to reconfigure my fingerprint, but there are times it can't read my print.I will update upon further use!","May 15, 2020"

This phone is clearly faster, but the best part is the smooth scrolling. Screen looks good, and I tend to trust displaymate. The finger print reader is instant so far. I noticed the sound of this phone has better base than s9 plus, voice of YouTuber sounded better on speaker. As a Samsung lover, I've been wondering what features I may miss. So far just occasionally checking on Samsung what time I fell asleep. For a moment, I recall thinking, Atmos, I doubt one plus covered that base. But they did.The gs9 + is lighter, and a bit shorter, and I can tell it feels better when limited to one hand. The galaxy s20+, my other consideration, is even lighter than the s9 plus. I think this is the main disadvantage to me, but so far I'm excited to give a new oem a chance. I think one plus checked so many boxes it was a compelling choice.

My last phone was a Pixel 2, which I had no real complaints about except it was getting old. Oneplus 8 Pro is definitely noticeable bigger than the Pixel 2 and the screen is also brighter and better. The in-display fingerprint scanner is pretty cool just have to make sure you put a screen protector on that doesn't mess it up. The phone is very fast and by far has the best battery life of any phone that I have used so far. Can almost get through 2 days with my regular use, also charging is very fast with the 30 watt charging. The only thing I don't like is the aggressive waterfall screen that goes down the sides, you will definitely have some unwanted screen touches, happens to me all the time while watching videos. But all in all, this is a great phone that does everything well and is a little cheaper than the flagships of Samsung and Apple.

It didn't have a lot of bloat wear and had a lot of features for its price point. When someone stole my phone the only thing that was keeping my spirits up was the excuse that I was buying the One Plus 8 Pro.And One Plus made sure to make me regret that.I got the device in Nov 2020. The new infrared camera filter that was called the x-ray filter, that had been deactivated in an upgrade over the summer. While they said they restored this to American models, mine never came back.Then I decided to switch to Google Fi service and found that the One Plus 6 and 7 are both comparable with Fi, but no longer is the 8 Pro or the 8T.i called customer support and was on the phone with a a person for an hour as she also was surprised at what I was telling her because she was not aware of this update also screwing up that as well either. Then there was the day when I was in the middle of downtown LA which is 80 miles from where I live and I was having constant issues with the device. This totally could have been a carrier issue although since my car broke down and I have an injured foot currently, it was not a pleasant experience. I had to have a stranger call my friend to come get me since payphones don't exist any more.Thankfully I realized that I had until the end of January to return it. Google Fi gave me a decent deal on the S20 Ultra Samsung and I chucked my carrier and sent back the phone. Maybe the 9 will wow everyone.

In comparison, my Note 9 and 10+ lasted about 15 - 20 hours with similar use. The camera system is great, especially the Macro feature.

Others have summarized the good points so I am going to focus on the bad:1.  Despite false advertising, this phone is not dual SIM in the USA at least.  An update has been promised since April ""next update"" but every update it is the same, no dual SIM.2.  The curved edge is critical to control this phone - scrolling, back and forward, etc.  Very cool and it works great except that it is impossible to hold the phone securely without activating the edge controls.  This means you have to hold the phone in the palm of your hand without touching the sides - not an easy trick and it makes it easy to drop the phone.3.  Because of the edge control issue, cases are poorly made for this phone.  I have tried three including the official OnePlus case, and all have the same issue - the edge protector ridge interferes with the swiping needed for edge control functions.4.  We have a documented issue where messages SMS that messages that are actually sent show up as unsent.  This problem reappears from time to time and OnePlus tech supports only answer is to totally reset the phone from firmware boot ROM (losing all apps and app data).  I just ignore the "" message not sent"" errors now but that is unacceptable in a flagship.4. Battery life is really so so.  I got a lot more life on my Moto z4.  Maybe the issue is the impressive 120hz display which looks amazing.  But battery life is just too short... In heavy use it doesn't last more than 6-7 hours.  Again, not bad for a mid-range but a flagship must do better.","August 11, 2020"

While it certainly has some great new capabilities (especially the camera and 5G) I just don't love it like I did the old one. The wireless connection is a little finicky.

Also, I'm a little worried about the screen. There are a couple of tiny nicks on the rounded edge, you can't see them unless the light is just right and I didn't notice them sliding my fingers up and down until my fingernail snagged one once.

Fortunately the face unlock is fast but I don't know who the idiot was at OnePLus who decided to put that crappy in Display fingerprinter reader combined with an enrollment time out. It took me 20 tries to get one fingerprint registered. Ridiculous. Also OnePlus has little to no support in the US. You can email them but usually their replies make no sense and your ticket will get passed from person to person, all of whom say the same thing NOTHING.

Came with a charger, simple case, and screen protector. Its unlocked, works on verizon but you have to contact them either by call or web chat to fully activate the phone, because out of the box it can only make/receive calls and send text but not recive them, so thats why you have to contact verizon.

I can say without reservation that this phone has thoroughly impressed me. The screen resolution and refresh rate make all the apps smooth and easy to read.

It is like u take the black punch hole camera and move it to the upper right hand corner and when it is moved out of the screen 1/4 of it is left and it is there permanent. Pretty big bummer and of course OnePlus said they can repair it but I have to send my phone on and I won't have it for 2-3 weeks ... Really ? They would replace it even when it is still brand new ... OnePlus has been Meh from the beginning since the phone came out ... They never had enough phones and there website didn't work right when trying to sell it at certain dates ....tons of complaints. So what do I do, I have to keep it I guess ... At least I am a prime member and the Amazon concierge have me some money on return back. Not happy with OnePlus.Also the camera is not really up to par ... When taking pictures on light it has very bad reflections in it ... Not that good after using a pixel device for a while ...Update: even the latest camera update hasn't done anything .... every shots from my wife's new note 20 and this 8 Pro and Geeez are the shots from the note 20 Ultra better ... Downloaded the new UI 11 and I may as well have a note 20. Very unhappy with this phone ... At this point to not going to recommend it anymore ... OnePlus, I am super disappointed!

It appears you can end up in a situation like myself where you are unable to receive text messages. I have been working w/ Verizon since Saturday to try and resolve to no avail. Outside of that, this should be the flagship phone for Android. Much better specs than we're seeing for the pixel 5 currently.Update: Having used the phone for the last month or so, it's still super buggy. I have issues w/ not being able to hear people who call me (intermittently), but I can hear them just fine if I call them, both on wifi(messenger) and over regular phone calls. Location services seems to not be right. I'll try and share my location, but it never updates, the ability to turn location always on is missing for a lot of apps. Issues sending MMS/Images over SMS. Some of this may be related to verizon, and I will know when my new sim card arrives, but I think a lot of it is due to custom OS that the OnePlus uses and apps not working properly with it.

I bought it at $500 2 months ago and now you can find it under $400, which is a steal for this level of performance and refinement. Coming from a OnePlus 6 with the fingerprint reader intelligently placed on the back, where my index fingers land every time, I find the screen-based reader awkward, but the face unlock is better than both and works great for me. Highly recommend this model, more than the 7Pro with its motorized selfie camera (simpler is better and more reliable) and the wisdom of staying a couple of generations behind the bleeding (expensive, risky) edge in this fast-moving industry.","September 17, 2020"

"OnePlus 7T Dual-SIM 128GB/8GB RAM (GSM, CDMA) Factory Unlocked 4G/LTE Android Smartphone - International Version (Glacier Blue)",Kelly Newell,4.0,"This product could not be added to the Verizon network. The stateside 7T is a different model number than the international model (which this is) and because of that Verizon would not add my device to the network. Troubleshooting this was a Kafka-esque experience, so if you are considering attempting it do read on and decide if you can live with some kind of work-around for text messaging.The phone is great. The only thing I didn't like is that the vibrate motor is very weak even on high power. It is, however, very smooth and quick to start and stop for tactile feedback. The phone is quick to load and switch between apps, google play app store works with it, screen was bright and very smooth with the 90hz refresh rate. The battery would last me about a day and a half, I would use it to punch in at work, chat with clients for maybe 30 min total, check a message board or website for maybe an hour total, and that's it. I'm not a heavy phone user. I wanted something responsive, with an LED screen (never want to go back to LCD) and good battery life and a good camera for social media crap, at a price that wouldn't drain my wallet. Most manufacturers only offer that level of competence on their flagships and at ~$1000 so I was happy to find this phone. I was extremely pleased with the device and wish I could keep it.It has been a month since I mailed it back and I still haven't received a refund. Not sure what the deal is with that, but I'm waiting on the refund so that I can hopefully get a US model. Amazon has always been prompt in the past so I don't know what the hold up is...Putting this phone on Verizon goes like this: Vzw defaults to sending a device texts through CDMA unless it is flagged as a CDMA-less device. This device needs that flag because it has no CDMA antenna. You can't set that flag unless the device is officially added to the network. They won't add it to the network because the model number is different from the US released model, which is the only one that is 'verified' to workThis took a month of back and forth through the tech support chat app. Vzw would close my tickets without notifying me or giving any kind of resolution brief. No way to track the issue in order to bring the next tech up to speed. I had to track it all myself and then argue my case and present the findings of the previous tier 2 techs just to get past the tier 1 techs and have an add-device request form submitted to some shadow division of the company. I'd be told I would be notified how it went, then it would get closed and I wouldn't get notified, and I'd have to start all over again. Loads of fun. At least tech support staff was patient with me and as helpful as I could hope for given the communication and documentation challenges.Why not just call tech support? Because Verizon's phone-in tech support requires you to receive text messages, which is the problem in the first place. I set up an in-person appointment but when I arrived I was informed that they no longer do tech support in person due to the Covid plague.Otherwise, the phone works great; makes and receive's calls, downloads and uploads data. The Vzw techs insist that the phone lacks software that allows it to be compatible with their network, but everything on the phone works with the network aside from that text/CDMA flag issue, which leads me to believe the tier 1 techs are working with very limited information. I could be wrong, who knows.","August 24, 2020"

They took over a month and it got to the point where I was emailing them every couple of days.

It basically appears to be a T-Mobile carrier, but it worked fine when I put my Ting sim card in, no issues.  It was confusing to set-up because I was so nervous that I received a locked phone by mistake.  The seller should include instructions on how to set-up for other carriers besides T-Mobile.  The phone itself has worked well so far.  Quick apps and charging, decent photos.  The color of the phone doesn't look like the photos.

With this phone I can't!  I have to have airplane mode off.I often don't get notified of a voicemail until I restart my phone.  Same thing for some text messages, I don't get them unless I restart the phone, or in some cases, just leave my apartment, which disconnects me from my WiFi and has me just on the Fi service data.Out of the box, the phone had several duplicate apps, including: Contacts, Phone, and a few others I can't remember.  If you know how to, you can use ADB to uninstall some apps, but you have to know the full name in order to do so, and I can't figure that out for some.  Also, the lone settings app I have access to seems to fit the same OnePlus theme, which makes me think I'm not able to use the stock android settings app.Lastly, the curved screen design is terrible!  I don't understand how people can put up with this.  I'm often accidentally tapping on the sides of an app when all I'm trying to do is hold the phone.  You really need one of those ring or popsocket cases in order to hold the phone without touching the sides.  Also, the curved bezel around the corners means some important info in certain apps is obscured.  I also noticed that the keyboard, while in landscape mode, has a gap below it (probably due to the curved screen), and in some apps, tapping the gap causes the keyboard to disappear.  This is very frustrating when trying to press the space bar that is *supposed* to be at the bottom of the screen but isn't.OVERALLDue to how powerful this phone is, I would definitely consider another OnePlus phone.  However, not if it has all of the same issues this one has.","July 27, 2022"

I tried speaking to the support crew - the first one wanted me to delete my cache and data not warning me that I will lose all the data on my phone.

"OnePlus 8 5G (128GB, 8GB) 6.55"", 5G / 4G Volte T-Mobile Unlocked (Interstellar Glow)",Quinn Mood,5.0,I am absolutely in amazement to this phone and the quality and the features it has along with the color and the price everything I'm so happy that I actually went through with purchasing this cell phone through this company. I was very hesitant after reading the reviews if you're like me you read reviews and you search and you compare before you purchase anything on Amazon but in this case I went ahead and decided to purchase even with the hesitation and I figured I could return if anything were to not workout.So delivery and shipping were fast although they did leave this package in the cold and since I live in Alaska that was not a very smart decision as far as mailing wise so I would suggest the seller to put a signature on cell phones so that they actually have to drop off the merchandise at the door with a signature they never did that in my case I don't know if that was supposed to be like that because it did save delivery signature on it but they never did that in this case so my phone could potentially could have been damaged by being in negative 10° weather since I live in Alaska and it's the middle of December 2021.However needless to say I knew that it was coming so I waited for the mail and I was able to get it out of the mailbox within an hour of it being delivered so my phone works just fine when I received this phone it was at 13% charged so I just went ahead and I charged the remainder of it while it was off and then when I was at 100% with the charger that came with it then I turned it on for the first time.One of my concerns were that it was not going to be unlocked truly even though a lot of sites or websites or pages stay that they are unlocked cell phones in most cases they are not luckily in this case going through this company with this OnePlus T-Mobile cell it was unlocked because as soon as I answered my SIM card the settings automatically reset and was compatible with my cell phone company that I go through for my telephone service. I believe I go through AT&t but it's GCI so general communications Incorporated so if anybody is wondering it will be compatible and it will work do not lose the silver little key that it comes with because that is how you take your sim card in and out of the phone you put that little key and you press it into the hole and it will eject onto the side of the phone and that is where you place your sim card into.Now the OnePlus 8 have a glass plated backing on it to where it appears to be a pink and yellow color or ombre color to it but it person and in reality when you receive the phone and open it yourself and look at it it's like it's glass it's more of a reflective than it is a solid color or an ombre color.I love it but it was not as it what I thought it would be but I love it even more so I cannot describe the appearance of this phone now I've always used Android cell phones I have never used or purchased a iPhone myself so coming from a Samsung phone or an LG phone or a Nokia phone this is very impressive. The OnePlus 8 has 128 GB I believe it has wireless charging capabilities it has an amazing 90 liquid hurts display screen on this type of cell phone and the capturing image on the photos are immaculate quality. I love that this style and this updated Windows Android 11 operating system has the perfect fingerprint authentication lock screen so that no one can access your phone without having your actual fingerprint pressed onto the phone it works instantaneously there's other phones that I've had before that were never as accurate as getting the correct imprint of my finger but this phone is amazing at this technology nowadays.I've had this phone for up to almost a week and it last me all day long on the charge now this was I believe a refurbished phone it was not a brand new phone at that so lasting all day long with the way I use my phone 24/7 throughout the day is pretty good for me I used to have to charge my phone constantly through the day throughout the day with this I do not I just charged this at night when I'm sleeping and in the morning it's at 100% and by the end of the night when I go to sleep it's at about 20% still. My recommendation is to not purchase a brand new phone go ahead and get the refurbished version if you if you can afford the new phone go for it it's all you but if you're trying to save a little bit go for the refurbished phone that's unlocked I believe this goes works and is compatible with CDMA and GSM technology and also has 5G and lower on this style phone. So everything was validated I'm going to see an update this review as time goes on before my 30 days if anything is to happen I still can return it I have about 3 weeks left on my return policy or I believe it was 90 days policy it might have been I need a check on that but if it's a 30-day window or whether it's a 90-day window on refurbished cell phones I still have that time frame to be able to replace this spell if anything was to happen or the battery does not charge correctly or if I notice anything that's not correct or the amount of money that I purchased this with I should be able to return or get my money fulfilled if it's not my satisfaction or if it's not up to my standards that is what I love about Amazon and I'm very happy with the seller go for it buy one you'll be happy you won't be upset or disappointed I hope this review helps somebody make a decision for a new cell phone with the one plus any version is good with the one plus I'm sure this is my first OnePlus cell phone and I will never buy another Samsung again it is not worth enough to purchase another Samsung for such an over evaluated price compared to the OnePlus which is drastically half the price in reduction to the cell phones this is my opinion and my suggestion stands. Thank you for looking at my review and good luck!,"December 19, 2021"

Quality of packaging & phone build is better than most I've seen and overall surpassed my huawei experience which I didn't know if would be the case.. Mine came in original box with the Oneplus charger & pprwork/Sim tool/case etc.. The box itself was a little roughed and phone did restart while activating tmobile Sim but everything works perfect and no scratch/indication of ever being used, I haven't even bothered unlocking it yet not sure if I will.. Worth noting that if you want the phone unlocked the instructions come in the box to open an app already installed & enter a ""oneplus approved"" unlock code.Overall very dope experience and appreciate the people getting these awesome phones out at these prices","June 11, 2020"
OnePlus 6T A6013 128GB Storage + 8GB Memory T-Mobile and GSM + Verizon Unlocked 6.41 inch AMOLED Display Android 9 - Mirror Black US Version,Gary Auerbach,5.0,"When I went to buy the phone I had my reservations because of all of the buyer beware comments. But when I got the phone and put my sim in. Any reservations I had went away. It fired right up and stared working like it was supposed to. After further inspection I noticed that the phone said it was an a6013 model and looked it up to no avail. So I called OnePlus and spoke with them about the model number. They told my that the only major difference with the a6010 and a6013 was that the a6013 was the dual SIM China unlocked model and that even if I did receive that phone instead it would have still functioned fine here in the US. The sim slots and startup screen are the only differences between the phone.The only down side about buying the one that I did. Is it didn't come with a charger or cable and if you want to use dash charging or any kind of fast charging on the oneplus 6t you will need a charger that works with their proprietary charging system.  But it did come with a pre-installed screen protectorThat all being said, It is a great phone for what I paid and I'd buy it again in a heart beat.","August 12, 2020"
OnePlus 6T A6013 128GB Storage + 8GB Memory T-Mobile and GSM + Verizon Unlocked 6.41 inch AMOLED Display Android 9 - Mirror Black US Version,Josh H,4.0,"Thoughts: first thing I noticed out of the box was the screen wasn't as big as I expected. It's marketed at 6.4 inches. The LGs I'm used to are far larger to my expectations. However, not a big deal for the OnePlus 6T.Setup was easy as usual with my Google account. FYI, for anyone on Verizon. This works nicely with Verizon. Hesitated buying this phone because of CDMA issues. Internet, messeging and video work perfectly. The only thing that doesn't work right off the bat was, I couldn't receive SMS messages. Not make phone calls with Verizon. Haven't fixed that for a week now. I used a third party phone app called, TextNow. Calls work fine on there. But, left out of SMS texts & calls. Other than that, all works fine (internet-wise).As color goes, nice colors. Saturated. AMOLED. I noticed it has perfect darks. Unlike LCD smartphones. Blacks are superb and rich. No backlit blacks.Audio on OP6T is average. Compared to my Pixel XL. OP6T lacks decent audio. It's fine for it's use. Just really muffled audio. Not good highs. Poor base. Mids are ok. Almost sounds like mono. The downfiring speaker is ok. Loud enough for general use. Nothing special.OP6T comes with a USB-C to 3.5mm Jack for your headphones. It's a converter, it is not stocked.There's a notch for the camera that can be changed in case you don't like the notch thing. I personally don't mind the notch.My OP6T came as the T-Mobile variant. In which I converted to global version. So that makes things better. Still works great.OP6T markets as 128GB but, once formatted it's about 105GB (for both T-Mobile & global variant). I'm on Android 10. With latest OxygenOS, 10.3.5. Very fast phone. Haven't noticed any slow downs. Great buy.Good: 128gb lots of space , flagship killer, CDMA/ GSM capable. Verizon limited. Solid built. Fast phone. 3,700 battery last me a day. Will have updates till 2021 and with Android 11 future update.Bad: Verizon limited, SMS and call problems. Audio is pretty lame, slow fingerprint reader, T-Mobile variant (can be removed just Google it. Voids warranty) and no MicroSD card slot for stage expansion. You'll need an OTG device for backing up your files and or online storage like Google drive. Otherwise there is always there option to hook OP6T to your PC.Camera: No opinion. Don't care at all for the camera. I use it for general use, only.","July 31, 2020"
OnePlus 6T A6013 128GB Storage + 8GB Memory T-Mobile and GSM + Verizon Unlocked 6.41 inch AMOLED Display Android 9 - Mirror Black US Version,Josh H,5.0,"This is the best phone that I’ve ever had.  Everything works as expected and it’s very fast.  I don’t know why people complain about the finger printer reader on the screen.  This one works as well as the rear mounted fingerprint reader only my last couple of phones.  I was little unsure about buying a phone without a headphone jack.  So, I used the money I saved on the phone and bought some wireless earbuds and I will never go back to wired headphones.  It’s so much easier to leave my phone on a table and walk around the house doing things without having to deal with the wires.  Now I use my headphones way more than I used to.  Do yourself a favor and get some wireless headphones with this phone.","January 27, 2019"

I purchased my device Feb 22, 2019 and received it the next day. When it arrived it was out of its plastic wrapping and the phone box was damaged. This didn’t really bother me because I was excited about the phone. I continued to set the phone up and unpack everything and noticed everything was in Chinese. This didn’t really bother me either because despite me getting a different model from what is being described and advertised from the seller, the phone itself is AMAZING. The OnePlus 6T is worth buying if you’re looking for a low budget high end phone and I did extensive research before buying to make sure I got the correct model seeing as it distributed from a Chinese manufacturer. The model that is being described is the A6013 but my model I got was the A6010. The 13 is the global model and the 10 is the China/India model. I decided to try and see if I could live with the model I got and my LTE data doesn’t work in most areas. This was a real slap in the face and will be returning the device and buying straight from the OnePlus website. I would recommend anyone wanting this phone to do the same.","February 26, 2019"
OnePlus 6T A6013 128GB Storage + 8GB Memory T-Mobile and GSM + Verizon Unlocked 6.41 inch AMOLED Display Android 9 - Mirror Black US Version,Jesse R,3.0,"One of the best features of OnePlus phones is a fairly vanilla Android ROM (firmware) with *relatively* low amounts of bloatware and spyware pre-installed.  OnePlus phones can all be flashed with better, privacy-centered ""ungoogled"" AOSP firmware by a very simple and instant user-unlock method, which makes them some of the best devices around for security, privavy and open-source-minded users.Apparently not so with the T-Mobile branded versions...T-Mobile packs a load of bloatware, spyware apps and spyware ""system services"" into their firmware image.  T-Mobile spies on you and sells your information that they gather this way, there is no way to opt out or prevent this from happening without removing the spyware from the ROM itself**, so T-Mobile has a monetary incentive to take the ability away from you to remove that garbage from the phone:  They lock the bootloader with an encryption key which you have to request and wait weeks for (if they give it to you at all)People familiar with phone modding will be familiar with this anti-consumer rights / anti-ownership process.  A 14 day wait period to unlock is not as egregious as manufacturers who lock you out of it permanently (or wait much longer).  But its completely unacceptable, especially for manufacturers which have a reputation for allowing you to use your device however you wish.Remeber: If you can't fully use, control or repair your device because someone is preventing you from doing so, you don't own your device.Corporation who sell you things you aren't allowed to own are stealing from you.For those curious: - The bootsplash is the pink T-Mobile screen - There's about a dozen spyware apps.  Be sure to nuke the radio hooks, esp if you want to use a Mint APN - OEM/bootloader unlock procedure is available through oneplus's website.  Wait is supposedly 7-14 days. - You can still rootlessly (sorta) remove the T-Mobile bloatware/spyware PER-USER in the interim period through the usual method with ADB, with the caveat that any OTA update can/will reinstall them all over again.","March 6, 2022"
OnePlus 6T A6013 128GB Storage + 8GB Memory T-Mobile and GSM + Verizon Unlocked 6.41 inch AMOLED Display Android 9 - Mirror Black US Version,Jesse R,4.0,"The description says that it is a factory unlocked phone while in reality it is an unlocked TMobile device. The phone is a model A6013 and can be used on the Verizon network with a little tweaking. I am currently on tracphone plan using a Verizon SIM card.When I first tried to send a text or connect to the network it wouldn't work. I did a little research on line and found that the device has to be set to use Vo-LTE. This can be easily enabled by dialing *#*#4636#*#* selecting ""phone information"" and changing the preferred network type to ""LTE/UMTS auto (PRL)"". Once I did that everything started working normally.The phone came in a white box and was wrapped in buble wrap. It was in fair condition for being a used phone. It had 2 unnoticeable scratches and a small pit that is barely noticeable when the screen is off. The back has some small pitting around the edges of the lense like it had been in a case.Overall I am happy with the phone in general. It kinda ticks me that it is a TMobile unlocked phone and shows the pink splash screen at startup but not enough to send it back. Another thing to note is that the back of the phone is incredibly slippery and easily dropped. Other than that I am happy with the phone. Possibly in the future I will reflash the software to the factory unlocked so that I can debrand the phone.","November 9, 2019"
OnePlus 6T A6013 128GB Storage + 8GB Memory T-Mobile and GSM + Verizon Unlocked 6.41 inch AMOLED Display Android 9 - Mirror Black US Version,CPL,4.0,"Incredible phone, better than $1000 iPhones and Samsungs. Blazing speeds for games. Camera isn't super awesome but I don't care cause I don't take pictures. They sent the Chinese/Indian model and not the US. This is true of both of the phones I bought. The box says A6013 but the phones are both A6010. Not a big deal so far here in Michigan or Ohio, but some areas may use different frequencies causing you to lose service but I'm not overly concerned personally. The difference between the A6013 and the A6010 is like 2 or 3 frequencies, I can't remember just Google it of you feel it will be a problem. That's the only reason why I gave the phone 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the mislabeling/false advertising. The battery is incredible often lasting 2 days or more if you don't use it all day. I can usually get 36+ hours and 7-8 hours of screentime before charging.","July 13, 2019"

More than I expected for the price. However it's listed as an a6013, but what they don't tell you is that this is a T-Mobile variant that has been unlocked and had global firmware installed. It will come with Android 9 and will be fully functional but will not receive any OTA updates. If you get curious about not getting any updates when it says Android 10 is available for the a 6013, you will receive instructions to install oxygen updater to get you updated. Once you update to Android 10 you will no longer be play protect certified and you cannot download certain apps like Netflix or Disney Plus, other things will stop working like Google pay. If you go through and arduous process to downgrade back to Android 9 those things will function again however there is no workaround to getting these functions on Android 10. I've been searching high and low for over a year now. Other than that the phone still quick and snappy where the Samsung my mother got is bogged down and frustratingly slow.","August 9, 2021"
OnePlus 6T A6013 128GB Storage + 8GB Memory T-Mobile and GSM + Verizon Unlocked 6.41 inch AMOLED Display Android 9 - Mirror Black US Version,Daniel Davis,3.0,"The box was sealed with the manufacturer's sticker so it was a good start to know that I got a new phone. It's unlocked, but you need to unlock it manually from one of the T-Mobile apps installed. Checked version of phone before I did it to make sure it was the A6013 model, since I planned to use it on Republic Wireless and that's the only version they support. After getting it working on Republic Wireless, I started to clean up the phone and delete apps. I deleted all the T-Mobile apps, except for the main T-Mobile app that cannot be uninstalled. You also cannot change the permissions for Call logs, Location, Phone, and SMS. Those are always on. So, they are pretty much can track your usage via this app even though it is an unlocked phone. It is collecting data since the storage and cache for this app are always increasing in size. I force stop the app and delete the storage and cache  whenever I remember, but I know that's not really a fix; just a band-aid. I really like the phone and don't want to give it up, so this is what I will live with. Phone is as amazing as everyone says, even in mid-2020, but the unethical practices of T-Mobile tracking you knocks it down two stars. 3 stars overall.","July 9, 2020"

It's probably the only Chinese manufacturer that supports all the T-mobile bands as opposed to international versions that don't. Oneplus is typically on top of the benchmarks for the same year flagships. Currently, Oneplus 8 uses snapdragon 865 and so Oneplus 6 uses the 845. The price-performance of the 6 is still better than flagship phones of the same year. The performance is way better than current budget phones. It's a lot prettier than the Pixels.

All prior models where amazing and I have almost no bad things to say about them but this model is full of problems. Facebook, YouTube, google, Google maps, messenger, Bluetooth, music, calls, have all froze or completely stopped working. This sometimes happens multiple times a day. I've tried to reset and reinstall everything. I have to restart my phone anytime one of them has an issue if I want it to work. It's been like this for the 3 months that I have owned it. The finger print sensor only works 1/3 times, most of the time it'll read your thumb as a fail more than once on an attempt and force you to use a pin anyways, making the in screen reader fairly useless since after timing it, I realised it takes nearly 3 full seconds to get a good read. Im not sure if all one plus 6t devices all behave like this but I'm 100% my device is completely defective which is concerning because mine was listed as being new, with these issues on a new model, I can't imagine how poorly the used and renewed models perform.","August 18, 2020"

"OnePlus 7T HD1907, 4G LTE, US Version, 128GB, Frosted Silver - GSM Unlocked for T-Mobile",Jay Chambliss,5.0,"I purchased this phone in November of 2020 to use on AT&T's network.  As soon as I received the phone and popped in the sim card, it worked like a charm.  Beautiful screen, fast refresh rate, great cameras in which I find the macro mode very useful. It updated to Android 11 and it makes my Iphone 11, which I also own, feel like a budget phone.  This phone is smoother and faster in every way.  The one hiccup I had is that at some point around February or March of 2021, when I would switch my Sim from my Iphone to this phone, AT&T would suspend my service and tell me that my phone was not compatible.  I would have to call AT&T and explain that I was just using the phone yesterday and, ""of course it's compatible"".  They would argue with me, but restore my service and the phone would be back to working with 4g LTE. I never understood why they kept suspending my service as my phone never showed any signs of not working with AT&T until they suspended it.  If you keep your Sim in one phone, I don't think this would be an issue, but since I was switching back and forth, they were cutting me off for some mysterious reason.  Fortunately, the last time I switched, it went smooth.  Perhaps the bug is fixed with AT&T.  I can't say so for certain, but his phone is definitely still worth it in 2021. I can't imagine any activities you might do on a phone that this phone cant handle.  Battery life is amazing.  If you're a moderate user like me, you might get two days on a charge.  It's an all around beast of a phone.","July 15, 2021"
"OnePlus 7T HD1907, 4G LTE, US Version, 128GB, Frosted Silver - GSM Unlocked for T-Mobile",Amazon Customer,5.0,"My old samsung was officially too old to run my banking apps and kept running out of space and crashing so I needed a new phone. Nothing fancy, just new enough to run everything without issues.I shopped around a LOT (I dont think phones should cost over 300$ but it's virtually impossible to find a solidly good phone that isnt) and I found this.I dropped my ATT nano SIM in during setup and it was instantly on the network, no issues (YAY!) and then I set to work setting everything else up.I gotta say I was SUPER impressed by how little bloatware there is on this phone. So that was a huge plus. I have also found dozens of small features I've missed out on with my 10 year old samsung (like the ability to action within the notification!).But there were also some cool features my friends with their iphone and pixel didnt have. Like the physical switch to choose silent/vibrate/ring without messing with the screen, and separate dedicate media volume buttons on the other side of the phone. And man does this phone get loud! A little distortion at the highest end but lowering to avoid the distortion is still loud.I've been able to add all my apps and settings and such in and the phone is still fast and responsive.Additionally, the display settings have some serious kick. I'm talking OLED TV type kick so that was a big surprise. The cameras appear to be really good as well.All in all I am incredibly happy with this purchase especially since I lucked out on a lightning deal so it was only $300 for me which was the perfect price for this much phone!","January 20, 2021"
"OnePlus 7T HD1907, 4G LTE, US Version, 128GB, Frosted Silver - GSM Unlocked for T-Mobile",Jay Chambliss,5.0,"This phone is great... insane value for the money and easily worth double what I paid.  Any number of reviews and youtube videos can tell you that. I'm here to share something different: Cricket is perhaps the worst of the ""bargain"" mobile service providers. Phone gets 5 stars, but this review is a cautionary tale for anyone on Cricket.The OnePlus 7t works fine on the Cricket network until they arbitrarily disable your service for using an unlocked phone rather than one purchased through their stores.  But they lie about this and will tell you that the reason is that they are dropping 3g support, which is BS because 1) this is a flagship phone, not a 3g antique and 2) their own site says they support 3g until Feb 2022.  I have been happily using this phone on their network since 1/11/21 until today. I was driving in an ice storm and the roads were terrible, cars in the ditch everywhere. I tried to call my girlfriend to tell her and her kids not to come to my superbowl party because the roads weren't safe, but my call went through to Cricket customer service who (after a loooong wait) first claimed I hadn't paid my bill, then changed the story to ""you need to buy a new phone from a cricket store"".  I convinced her to reactivate my phone as it was kind of a life and death situation, but she kept telling me to upgrade my device at a cricket store or cricket dot com.My phone worked for one hour before it got deactivated again.If you are on Cricket, buy this phone and switch carriers. I cannot say enough bad about Cricket at this point. Avoid them like the plague. This might sound dramatic, but being a cricket user could have potentially led to injury or worse of my loved ones. Cricket is cheap for a reason.","February 8, 2021"

"OnePlus 7T HD1907, 4G LTE, US Version, 128GB, Frosted Silver - GSM Unlocked for T-Mobile",Jessica,5.0,"Got this for my dad and overall, he's loving it so far. Great screen, camera, fast, etc. Don't need to pay big for Apple or Samsung, when you can get this for a fraction of the price.And like some others have mentioned, with regards to Verizon, this phone does work perfectly. The only issue we had was with receiving texts, for which we contacted Verizon to activate CDMA-less. They took the IMEI number and within 24 hours, we were able to receive texts perfect. (I know other reviews mentioned GSM-less or something, overall not sure of the difference, but CDMA-less was what I found online for the texting issue and it worked). Definitely get this if you're with Verizon and considering it.Other than receiving texts, everything from data/internet, sending texts all worked fine on the first try with a Verizon sim.","December 5, 2020"

"OnePlus 7T HD1907, 4G LTE, US Version, 128GB, Frosted Silver - GSM Unlocked for T-Mobile",Tarun Jada,1.0,"got this one to replace Huawei Mate 9, and connecting to T mobile network.Never got issue with T mobile signal on other phones in the past few years, both android and Iphone.However, this one drop the connection like crazy, at least two or three times a day. Sometimes in the middle of phone call.Never re-connect automatically, unless manually reboot.A terrible product. What is good of a phone if it cannot call.And the customer service is terrible.To me, the problem is straight forward. All other 3 phones from the 4 line plan work well in the same location, the old phone never failed me in several years. And all the nightmare started with this new phone.However, the customer representative asked me to contact T mobile to resolve the problem.I refused to call t mobile, waiting 30 mins and to asking some a question I do not know.Then they started to  giving me long instruction to debug the phone. holding this key for 15 sec, then holding two keys then release one key ............... Is it crazy to ask customer to do it?Then it comes to common sense question.  They claim that manual re-boot could re-connect the 4G, this phone is consider working well.  Ennnnnnn.  you cannot say a new car is well function when it could loss power in the high way at any time.How long should it take to return a dis-function product?  It takes more than one hour, much longer than expected.","January 25, 2021"

They are not signed, so you need to disable device driver signing to do so.Search for ""Disable driver signature enforcement"" , and follow the steps to boot windows into unchecked signature mode.Plug in your OnePlus 7t, and if USB debugging is enabled, turn it off so the virtual drive loads containing the OnePlus 7t drivers setup. Proceed with installation. You will get a red dialog warning about the unsigned driver.

You must contact Verizon tier two tech support and explain that you have a factory unlocked Oneplus 7T and would like to register the IMEI  number with their system and activate GSMA-less provisioning on your phone number who's sim card you will be using. It will take one-three days to get the IMEI in the ir system but afterwards simply put your old sim card in your new phone and it should work like a charm.

Once I added the 7T to the mix it became quickly apparent based on the ram, processor and screen that it really was a no brainer which device was the best bang for the buck.  The added benefit of type c charging, in screen finger print reader, and it being on sale for around $400.00 made it such a good deal that I bought another for my daughter for Christmas!

I should've known better than to buy a phone with no warranty... What does it tell you about a company's confidence in their product if they don't offer a warranty?Anyway...I bought this phone because it had been rated relatively high on multiple websites that rank phones, and this was a solid pick in the value category. Regardless of that however, shortly after the Amazon return window closed and for no obvious reason, this phone began to randomly stop sending and receiving text/MMS messages for days at a time, and then occasionally the mic would also randomly stop working while making calls! The problems would always go away after a time, but if a phone doesn't have the ability to call/text when you need it, it's unacceptable...I had thought that OnePlus was a good company, but it turns out that I'm only one of many that have been having similar issues with their phones of late...

Shooting in night mode is very bright, and shooting video in 4K with the built-in hand stabilizer makes it look like a pro. It didn't come with a music playback app, but I installed the free Pulsar from the google play store.

OnePlus Nord 2 5G Euro 4G Volte GSM Global 128GB + 8GB 50MP Triple Camera NFC Dual Sim International Version (w/Fast Car Charger Bundle) (Blue Haze),aislinginjp,2.0,"I wanted to like this phone. Too bad.Background: I needed to replace my dual SIM Moto G8. Very few made-for-US unlocked phones have dual SIM capacity, and my second SIM is European, so I usually get phones for the EU or South Asian markets. I also wanted 5g, if possible, and a slightly better camera than I had with the Moto. Overall, I was happy with the Moto-- it was a no-frills workhorse--but they had not updated their dual sim line with anything I wanted. I checked reviews, and decided on the OnePlus Nord. So, this is a phone targeted to South Asia being used in the USA. I've never had a major problem with that before.***Two big problems started from the first day out of the box: it does not hold a charge well, and loses internet connection constantly.I don't play games on my phone, and I rarely watch more than 15 minutes of video a day. I do have a lot of apps, but try to limit what's running in the background. Nevertheless, my phone drains from 100% at 8AM to below 40% by nightfall. I often have to recharge it during the day. This started as soon as I got it, and has only become worse over the 6 weeks it has been in use. The past few phones I had took a couple of years for the battery to become this bad.However, the loss of connectivity is the bigger problem for me. I am on TMobile which is a GSM network so that's not the issue. And TMobile 5G & 4G coverage in Boston, where I live & work, is excellent. I have not had a problem with phones losing data connectivity since the early 2000s, but something about this phone takes me straight back to those days. My job requires me to scan documents on my phone and text or email them often, and to track certain types of news. The internet will work for 5 minutes then will drop without me taking a single step in any direction. It drops when I'm outside, when I'm inside, when I'm standing still, when I'm walking, when it's sunny, when it's raining. My internet connection is so unreliable that I now have to carry my IPad as a backup for work. This is annoying.A third problem is that a few times a week the phone spontaneously shuts down. I don't mean that I accidentally hit the wrong button and it turns off-- I mean, out of nowhere, it just decides to power down. Sometimes it reboots, sometimes it doesn't. It was sitting on my coffee table completely untouched last night and it happened again. Take it as an indication of how trying the other problems are that I don't even consider this one of my top issues.I checked the NordPlus support forums for all of these problems, but have found no useful advice. I'm definitely not the only customer having these issues, and that is especially true for the internet connectivity problem-- complaints from all over the world for dropped internet connections.The reason I'm giving it two stars is that the camera is very good for this price point, as is the sound quality for calls and for podcasts. I have not had any trouble running all my apps, beyond the obvious problems with them becoming non-workable without an internet connection. The physical profile is nice.None of this makes up for the problems. Other phones from OnePlus get good reviews. Maybe this model is an anomaly.  This is my first OnePlus phone, and probably my last.","March 22, 2022"

"OnePlus 3T 6GB-RAM 64GB-ROM A3000 Factory Unlocked Phone - 5.5"" Screen US Version - Soft Gold",Jimm,5.0,"Update: I own both a OP3 and OP3T... and it has been two years since they were released. Both phones have  received OTA updates to Android 8.1 and will receive Android 9 Pie in a few weeks. That is far better support from any Android manufacture and easily better than what Samsung provides to phones that cost more than twice as much! If you can buy a OnePlus phone, do so! You will not be disappointed! When the OP7 comes out, it will have been three years since the OP3 was released. I'll be picking up the OP7 and unlocking it by touching anywhere on the front of the phone.... instead of the back where a sensor does not belong Apple and Samsung!Absolutely amazing phone for the price. It turns on faster and does so much more than an iPhone and costs half of what Apple gets. Other reviewers have listed all of the many great features of this phone. But I want to add a feature that I recently discovered, that is not touted, at all, by this company. I don't know what to call this feature; it is so much more than splash proof, but maybe not completely waterproof. But it is a welcome, if unexpected, feature that I can describe. You can give it a name. My wife and I had been paddling miles and miles of several different springs in central Florida. We spend a lot of time on boats and are comfortable on boats. But we also usually put valuables in dry bags or take other precautions to protect gear like phones and cameras. Our last day, we took an impromptu, short little paddle down a spring; first time the paddle had been open since hurricane Irma. We had been paddling all over Florida, for miles and miles without incident, but sure enough, with our phones in our pockets, we tipped when current pulled the canoe under some freshly cut tree branches (sharp!) My wife's OnePlus was in the water for a couple of minutes. My OnePlus was in the water for 10 minutes or more. We immediately shook the water out of them as best we could. Her phone continued to work normally, but we turned it off until it was dry. Each time we checked it, it just worked!  My OnePlus, however, would not turn off and the display was doing weird stuff that reminded me chemically induced visuals from the 70's. As soon as we could, we wrapped them both in high quality, fluffy towels to dry. I thought my phone would run itself down, as I couldn't turn it off and I was sure it would fry itself in the process. But during the drying process, after a few minutes, it put itself into sleep mode. I could wake it and the screen would come on, as normal, but I couldn't turn it off. After a few hours, I could turn it off with the power switch and it seemed almost normal, even the fingerprint sensor worked. But the ringer side switch wasn't working all of the time. Off to the airport! At the airport, my wife's phone continued to work normally, as did mine: wifi, cell data, camera, and we boarded with the electronic tickets we normally have on our phones. Nice. During the flight home, the side ringer switch started working normally. The only thing not working, now, was one capacitive button (go back button).  I could live with that. I plugged in the Dash charger and lo and behold it was charging, normally. Didn't even get warm. Used my phone as hard as I could during the flight and with data at a layover. Headphones, OTG, file transfers... Everything worked except the one capacitive button. We thanked our lucky stars and got home. The next day, my capactive button started working again. So, 24 hours after going swimming, one for several minutes, both phones were working normally and have continued to do so, since. Thank you OnePlus!","February 28, 2018"
"OnePlus 3T 6GB-RAM 64GB-ROM A3000 Factory Unlocked Phone - 5.5"" Screen US Version - Soft Gold",Sam,5.0,"The last phone I had was a OnePlus One, and this newer model definitely seems to be less glitchy (but the OnePlus One still works very nicely).The camera is very good, and the front facing camera has also been improved. The screen is also brighter, so I keep the brightness setting very low. You can also set clicks and the lower buttons to do different things which is nice.One thing I dislike is that when holding it, I sometimes accidentally press the very sides of the screen with the hand that is holding it. I'm hoping a phone case will fix this problem.All the listings I've seen on Amazon are more expensive than on the OnePlus site, so unless you have a lot of Amazon gift card money, you might want to go there.","April 21, 2017"
"OnePlus 3T 6GB-RAM 64GB-ROM A3000 Factory Unlocked Phone - 5.5"" Screen US Version - Soft Gold",Jimm,4.0,"Seller:I bought this phone from NGP STORE USA and everything went really smooth. I was worried of not receiving the USA version (A3000), since many people who bought this phone ended up with the Chinese one (A3013), this seller did a great job regarding that point. The only thing that I can criticize is the price, you can get this phone for $439 directly from the oneplus site (I paid $529).Hardware:- This phone has the same chipset, CPU and GPU that the Google Pixels phones use but paired it with 6GB of ram (the pixels have 4GB). It uses a 3400 mAh battery combined with the a Full HD AMOLED screen gives you great battery life.- The 16MP back camera is really good and I love the flexibility that gives you in manual mode, the laser focus works quite well and the OIS is something that every phone camera should have. I was surprised about the flash, although it is not dual tone it handles fairly good the low light pictures. Bottom line, this camera is excellent but don't expect something outstanding as the Samsung S7 Edge camera.- The front camera has 16MP but is not even close to the rear one (no OIS, no flash, bigger pixel size and more).- The screen is ""only"" FullHD but being AMOLED adds something here. Great view angles, great colors and outstanding contrast.- The audio is excellent! Matching big competitors as the HTC 10.- Other details, the fingerprint sensor is made of ceramic and works incredibly good. The back camera glass is made of sapphire which is super scratch resistance. The metal body gives the phone a premium look and the alert slider on the left side is something that every smartphone should have. No SD card slot, but the dual SIM works like a charm (you can choose which SIM to use for calling, SMS and data). It has a USB type C connector which is nice for the future but right now most cables are just micro USB. The Dash charge is amazing but you need to use the provided cable and charge adapter.Software:The phone came with OxygenOS 4.0.3 which is based in Android Nougat 7.0 and I was able to update it to OxygenOS 4.1 (based on android 7.1.1) using the app Opera VPN and choosing Canada as the location.If you are like me and prefer a more stock android experience you will love OxygenOS, it's light, customizable and secure (encryption is enabled by default).Finally, this device has great third-party developer support, this is a great plus because sooner or later it will lose official support but the third party developers will keep the software updated (think in CyanogenMod A.K.A. LineageOS).Conclusion: This devices is great for money, it's has a top notch hardware and a lightweight software, combining those 2 things you will have 0 lag experience something you won't find in heavily changed android skins (like LG or Samsung).","March 25, 2017"
"OnePlus 3T 6GB-RAM 64GB-ROM A3000 Factory Unlocked Phone - 5.5"" Screen US Version - Soft Gold",Kathleen,1.0,"I've never once had a refurbish purchase go as badly as this one. Bought the Oneplus 3T and had a great time with it, minus the fact that the screen had very severe burn in. I was willing to look past the burn in for what I thought was a super slick deal I was getting on a refurb. Then, 4 days after purchase, I locked my screen and it never turned back on. You can boot recovery all you want but the display is 100% screwed. As someone who used to repair and refurbish devices, specializing in phones, this kind of refurbish quality is absolute hot garbage. The fact that you can call yourselves a company at all surprises me. Don't ever buy a product from MLG Group. I'm almost certain they pay for good reviews at this point. Any of the bad reviews that I saw would mention the same issues I have, and some of them have returned their phones for a refund, and had never gotten it. I will not be returning the phone, and I will be replacing the parts myself, as to not get completely screwed over by them since they'd keep the phone and probably dodge the refund.DO NOT BUY FROM THE SELLER MLG GROUP.edit: possibly gonna be buried at this point, but I figured it was worth mentioning that I managed to refurb this phone myself at the cost of the extra parts and my own time. The phone continued to last me until I got my next refurb at the end of the 3T support cycle. It would constantly get hot, way hotter than any other 3T's I could compare it to. I assume this could have been something wrong with the refurb I received. My thought on this still stands though, seller sucks for selling phones that don't work, or hardly work until they entirely break. The positive reviews they had I assume were from bot accounts since that plagues Amazon reviews now. Look around for the varied responses, and trust your gut. If everyone says ""product arrived and works"" with 5 stars on it, with no mention of what the product actually was, or any sort of personal anecdotes, don't bother buying it. It's probably junkware trash they're trying to push on you for a quick buck.","July 16, 2019"
"OnePlus 3T 6GB-RAM 64GB-ROM A3000 Factory Unlocked Phone - 5.5"" Screen US Version - Soft Gold",Rodrigo A.,5.0,I used to have a Droid Turbo. I got it when they first came out when I was with Verizon and I took it with me when I left and went to Cricket. That was about 2.5 to 3 years ago. This past November after almost 4 years of use the phone started acting up. Rebooting on it's on. Saying that the battery was low but then when i place it on charger it shows it has like 68% juice. It ran slow and would do all kinds of crazy things. So I started looking at other phones. I looked at the Samsung series of phones Hwiwai's and other Motorola's. I did a search for phones on Amazon and came across the OnePlus series. I started doing my research and found that they had alot of the same features that the Samsungs and all the other High end phones but at half the cost. So I dug deeper. I found some videos on YouTube that compared phones and the only reason that the OnePlus 3t lost out to the Samsung 7 and 8s was camera quality and the other phones are waterproof. I am happy with the price i paid 349.00 as oolpposed to 699+. This phone is awesome. My son wants a Google Pixel. Im thinking of giving him this one and getting the OnePlus 5t for myself,"March 6, 2018"

I had no issues with it up until recently. It's extremely fast, great camera, charges in 30 mins, extremely customizable. just all around great. This is coming from someone who previously owned an iPhone and Samsung Galaxy s6. My provider is TMobile. There was a recent switch in there tower and as of 2 weeks ago I only recent a maximum of 2g service. No data coverage whatsoever. I am using my phone strictly with WiFi. When I called TMobile they said there was nothing they could do. Then I called OnePlus and was told that this is a Chinese model and that it lost functionality at the discretion of TMobile.

"OnePlus 3T 6GB-RAM 64GB-ROM A3000 Factory Unlocked Phone - 5.5"" Screen US Version - Soft Gold",Sam,3.0,"I had previously been an apple person. I enjoyed my iPhones when I had them, but as my last one started to wear down I decided it was time for an upgrade and had heard good things about OnePlus. When it arived, I was very excited to make the switch to android, and although I've had some issues with it, I still like what android has to offer over apple products. It was fast and sleek (and honestly still is), but I started running into issues with charging. My wife and I have a charger by our bed for both of our phones with two 1 and 2.4 amp usb ports. Both of us had previously had issues with our phones batteries dying prematurely due to using higher amperage chargers. Even though the dash charge box says it goes up to 4 amps, I did not want to risk losing my battery and kept my phone in one of the 1 amp slots (also when charging it over night there's no need to charge it faster). One moring, I woke up to my charging cable being disconnected from my phone. When I picked up my phone, I realized that there was still a peice of the charger left in my charging port. I looked on the internet to see if this had happened to anyone else, and apparently it is a midly common issue. I contacted OnePlus to see if my phone could be reiared under warranty. The customer service rep was super nice, and asked for my order number from their website. I told him that I had bought the phone off amazon and did not have an order number from them, but the ad said the phone came with a 1 year warranty. He apologized and said he could not repair the phone under warranty, but it could be repaired if I paid for it, but could not give me any sort of quote and sait it could take a minimum of about 3 weeks for me to get my phone back. At this point, I had already tried to charge the phone with a different cable and it worked just fine as long as you were careful putting it in. I told him that I would work it out myself. So I looked up how much the part would be and how hard it would be to repair. It was all pretty cheap and looked easy enough, but the part had to come from over seas and would take weeks to ship. I told myself it would be fine and left my phone as it was, and was just very careful when I plugged it in. As more time went on, it started acting up again, and I called a local phone repair shop. They told me that they could not get the part to repair the phone. I tell myself again that it will be fine and move on with my life babying my phone every time it comes near a charger. Finally the other day it breaks. My phone will no longer charge and I have to repair it myself. I love the phone. Even after being a few years old, it still works super well, but im very frustrated the in under a year I've had to repair it with no help from the manufacturer. If anyone is still looking at getting this phone, be warned. It's been awesome, but there are things that can go wrong very quickly.","November 14, 2018"

The long list of pros include the premium build quality/ durability, great overall performance from SD 821 and 6 GB RAM, Oxygen OS with theming options, fast fingerprint sensor, extremely fast DASH charging, headphone jack and good but not great camera.  Only cons I can think of are the placement of the speaker on the bottom and the 1080p display which isn't anything special but helps conserve battery.

"OnePlus 3T 6GB-RAM 64GB-ROM A3000 Factory Unlocked Phone - 5.5"" Screen US Version - Soft Gold",Sam,5.0,"OnePlus have been making a name for themselves over the last few years but this is the first mobile from them I've actually had in my hands.The OnePlus 3T is a lovely looking mobile, it has a premium look and feel to it with a nice 5.5"" screen, fingerprint scanner and decent cameras this can easily go toe-to-toe with the big boys.On the right side of the mobile is the SIM tray (which can hold 2 SIM cards) as well as a power/lock button.  If pressed twice the power button quickly starts the camera.  You can also quick start the camera by drawing an 'O' on the screen, so whichever method you pick you're only ever a few seconds away from capturing the moment.On the bottom is a standard headphone socket, USB Type C charging point and the speaker.On the left is the volume rocker and, in another first for me, an Apple inspired switch to quickly change sound levels to save having to unlock the handset to pop it on silent.Unfortunately there is no micro-SD card slot so I'd recommend going for the 128GB version rather than the 64GB version to ensure you've lots of space available.To make use of the type C charging point you get a Dash Charger in the box.  This claims to rapidly charge up the 3T and in use it lives up to this, instead of the phone taking hours to fully charge you only need to pop it on for 30 minutes to get it ready for the day.  If, before heading out for the evening, you want to give it a quick 10 minute top up you'll see in the review video that gives it around 15% extra charge after just 10 minutes.The 5.5"" screen looks great and is brilliant for games, videos, general browsing, as colours look vibrant and it's very responsive.  Games play really well but the speaker placement means you'll very likely cover it over when playing any games where you hold the phone in landscape mode.The cameras are good, you get decent front and rear facing cameras and the ability to quickly open the camera up is a real bonus.  There are the usual photo and video modes available along with slow motion and time lapse.  The auto focus seemed to be a bit jumpy at times, especially noticeable on some of the slow motion and time lapse captures I've done.The fingerprint scanner is really rapid, you won't even realise you're using it once it's setup, the phone unlocks very quickly.  You'll also set a backup password in case there is a scanner issue and for whenever the phone is powered off/restarted.There are lots of little software enhancements, as previously mentioned you can draw an 'O' to unlock the camera, but there are a number of additional gestural shortcuts such as toggling flashlight, controlling music and taking screenshots.The OnePlus 3T is by no means a budget mobile, but when you consider the price of top end phones it offers incredible value for money.  It has a premium look and feel along with a fantastic set of specs that give you everything you need from a top end mobile.Yes there are little niggles around the auto focus and the speaker placement during gaming, but overall the quality of the mobile, the speed of the charging and the power on offer make this a brilliant all round package.","December 30, 2016"

"OnePlus 3T 6GB-RAM 64GB-ROM A3000 Factory Unlocked Phone - 5.5"" Screen US Version - Soft Gold",Mark J Draper,5.0,"As daily drivers, I've previously used iPhone 3G through 6S, Samsung S5, various Nokia Windows phones, and most recently, the Google Nexus 6P which I always returned to since its original release... NOT ANYMORE! I love my Oneplus 3T! (purchased directly through the Oneplus Site)The Nexus 6P, Google's own flagship smartphone from 2015, ran 3GB of RAM and a revised Snapdragon 810 SOC. It had a beautiful 1440p Amoled screen and deep front-facing stereo speakers allowed by moving the home button to the rear. It ran stock Android and received updates early and often for a great price (I paid around $549 for a 64GB model)  I was initially afraid of switching to the OnePlus line because although I'd used iPhones exclusively for over six years, I'd grown to love less ""thumb work."" I was also afraid to lose the updates, high-density screen and amazing dual speakers. Would the quad core 821 even be a noticeable bump over the octo core 810? Let me tell you, the 3T has been an amazing upgrade for me.SCREEN: Despite the display being a 1080p panel, it's gorgeous-- if you're unsure, go to a brick and mortar store and check out the  Samsung Galaxy A5-- it  has a similar 1080p 5'5"" AMOLED. I can't really tell unless I hold it directly next to my 6P. Many people don't consider how a lot of web content is still non-HD; it only gets more pixelated on a sharper display. Most important to me is that I can't see individual pixels like I can on the iPhone, so the screen gets a thumbs up!SOUND: The speakers aren't dual-front-facing like my Nexus 6P, but this guy is clear and loud! My headphones still sound great and work well which is important for me-- no silly hardware issues. I thought I'd be demoted to a ""tin can"" speaker after being spoiled by the rare boombox-like 6P, but I'm not disappointed!BODY/POWER: It's got a slightly smaller screen than the Nexus 6P (5.5 instead of 5.7), but the bezels are also a lot smaller, making for a phone that's easy to handle in one hand. I don't even notice that the screen is smaller, and I'm glad my phone fits in my pocket again (did I mention it's lighter weight?). The 16MP selfie camera has all of my Snapchat friends super jealous (despite low-light hiccups common in the industry) . Not a problem for me, but my friends have mentioned accidentally pressing the power button when squeezing the volume because they're on opposite sides of the device. The home button is capacitive so it's easy to press. Via software you can alter the button arrangement (to be like Samsung), add in shortcuts (ie. hold to multi-task, double-tap to show widgets, etc.), or even enable an on-screen digital nav bar if you're into that. In a similar way, you can change the color profiles of the AMOLED panel, and even the color them of the system settings. It's got all the benefits of Android 7 Nougat, and the overclocked 821 paired with 6GB of RAM keeps all-day multitasking smoother than any Android phone I've used which means, like the Apple iPhone, it outperforms the competition in saving you time opening and maintaining apps. I can't wait to see what the next OnePlus device brings!At under $500, the Oneplus 3T is the true Nexus Phone of 2016.ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT?I gave the device five stars despite having a software issue when I received my brand new unit (update corruption). Technical Support helped me, and within 12 hours I was up and running, so that's great! Thanks support!Compared to all the 2016 competition, nothing comes close to the OnePlus 3T in value for money in the U.S. -- it looks, feels, and performs just as well as phones that cost twice as much, and no other phone has this much RAM and can charge this fast. I'd love to have a waterproof device, but I can't justify buying an $800 phone for that feature. Maybe next generation?SHOULD YOU BUY ONE?Be sure it works on your carrier. Tmo and AT&T customers are fine. If you already have a Snapdragon 820 or equivalent SOC phone, I'd pass on the OnePlus 3T. If you've got an 810/older you're not only going to see a speed jump in apps and gaming, but the 6GB of RAM may be more than triple your current! It's got a headphone jack, which the similarly specced HTC U Ultra does not have. I can charge my phone to full in about an hour, and I can't stop gushing over the 16MP selfie shooter <3","March 14, 2017"
"OnePlus 3T 6GB-RAM 64GB-ROM A3000 Factory Unlocked Phone - 5.5"" Screen US Version - Soft Gold",Mark J Draper,3.0,"I was expecting to receive a super duper phone, the truth is that it is not much better than the Honor  X 5 that it replaced .The cameras are not much better, the battery life is marginally worse than  Honor X 5.It is faster though and has a marginally better screen. The fingerprint sensor is in an awkward position, on the X 5 it was on the back  and much easier to use.I use English, Spanish and Portuguese keyboards, it is painfully slow to switch between keyboards on the 3T , was a lot faster on the X5.I have  had no problems with freezing  or the  3T phone getting bogged down with memory sucking apps but I am careful not to use to many anyway.The phone is OK, a disappointment but OK.

"OnePlus 3T 6GB-RAM 64GB-ROM A3000 Factory Unlocked Phone - 5.5"" Screen US Version - Soft Gold",Raul,5.0,"I've always been a carrier specific phone guy. Never had any use for, or trust in factory unlocked phones....until now. While the OP3T is a mid-range device (according to some), my personal opinion is, it's without a doubt, the best phone I've ever used, and I've used a bunch of them. Like probably 80% of the population, I don't use a smartphone to it's full potential. I use social media, surf the web, read emails, check the weather, and take a few photos from time to time. I'm not a gamer, and I have no need for a phone that is capable of controlling the international space station. For a guy (or gal) who wants a good solid, and well performing smartphone that won't cause you to have to take out a second mortgage on your house in order to buy it, you can't go wrong with this device. The display is gorgeous, and unless you have microscopes for eyes, you won't be able to tell the difference between the 1080 display, and the 1440 display on a Samsung. The device is very user friendly, with easy to navigate settings. I originally ordered the Huawei Mate 9, and yes, it IS a beast of a phone, but with it, there are settings within settings, within settings, and even sub settings. I monkeyed with that phone for days trying to figure it out, and ultimately sent it back, then ordered this OP3T. I couldn't be happier. It does what I need it to do, and does it flawlessly. If you want a particular phone to enhance your status, or think you need a $1500 phone that shows the world that you have more money than you have sense, then this probably isn't the phone for you. Nothing fancy about it. It's not diamond encrusted, it doesn't double as a drone, it doesn't have all kinds of flashing lights on it, but it DOES make phone calls, it DOES send and receive text messages, it DOES have access to all the popular social media sites, and it DOES have internet access, which all work quite nicely, I might add, with absolutely no lag. In the grand scheme of things, what more do you need?!","February 4, 2017"

No lag or stutters. 1080p is sharp enough and I'm not missing the extra pixels my previous phone (S6 Active) had. Getting almost 7 hours of screen on time. Fingerprint scanner is fast and reliable.

One Plus 5 A5000 Factory Unlocked Dual Sim Dual Camera - US Vesion - Midnight Black (8GB+128GB),Turner,5.0,"I've been using OnePlus phones for years now and I love them. I found out about them back when the OnePlue 2 was coming out, I had just destroyed my new Galaxy (the first one with a curved screen, can't remember the number). An IT guy I knew told me about them and how cheap they were. I wasn't trying to pay Verizon $1000 for a new Galaxy, and the OnePlus 2 was around $300 new. The catch was you needed an invite to buy one. My IT friend worked that out for me and I got the phone, and loved it. I used it for 3 years without issue and still have it sitting in a drawer in my bedroom in case tragedy strikes and I need a phone in a pinch.This phone (actually the 5t, not the 5) is absolutely great. I originally didn't like the fingerprint scanner being moved the back of the phone, but I got used to it pretty quickly. I love that these phone come with basic android and that's it, no bloatware you can't remove. You can then customize them and build them out however you like. I was really impressed with the battery, I can go all day without having to charge. It also comes with the Dash Charger, it will charge the phone completely in around an hour. I'm a big fan of the all-metal body as well, the construction feels very solid.OnePlus phones are generally comparable to Samsung phones in terms of capability and power, but at 1/2 the price. One thing to consider is these phones will only work on a GSM network, so AT&T or T-Mobile are your only options for major carriers in the US. But you can get a cheap month-to-month plan because you brought your own phone, which is pretty nice.5 Stars: great product for amazing price.**Reviewer is a notorious OnePlus fanboy","August 3, 2018"
One Plus 5 A5000 Factory Unlocked Dual Sim Dual Camera - US Vesion - Midnight Black (8GB+128GB),Billtech66,5.0,"I bought this phone because I am sick and tired of the recent trend of smartphone designs such as the notch, or removing the headphones port. This phone is still quite powerful even at almost 2 years old now, has absolutely brilliant battery (100% SOT estimated at 11 hours, mixed usage estimated at 35 hours), and most importantly, still doesn't have a notch, and still has a headphone port. It's sad that so many phone manufacturers feel the need to follow these trends of thinner phones with no bezel to the detriment of both removing useful features and also making ugly design choices like the notch.One negative I would say is the phone is too thin and slippery. You will need a case. But that's nothing compared to how awesome the phone is, even in 2019!","March 23, 2019"

Nothing wrong with the settings.There is no tech support, only hard to contact and only by email someone that is trained to mislead, and divert you, waste your time so it's too late to return.I have another phone with the same carrier, a Sony z2 that has the same programs, same set up but works just fine when away from wifi.This OnePlus 5 HAS NEVER USED ANY data. zero data used. Because it's not capable of doing so.Can't contact anyone at OnePlus, and options for tech support is very limited for troubleshooting yourself.prior review:Best battery life of all 9 other phones I've owned.Fast processor, nice shape and size, bright and vivid screen.Best camera for scanning barcodes ever!Dual cameras, one a 20Mg telephoto, the other 16Mg wide angle like all phone cameras.but three problems:1. flash only highlights near and brighter objects.2. Cannot receive pictures through SMS, called MMS. Fails to work, but keeps trying, popping up a warning that not able to, making an irritating sound. No way to see or find out who or where or when it came from. Repeated warnings seemingly randomly throughout the day and night.3. Unable to access internet through mobile phone carrier (I tried two: AT&T and Consumercellular). So, always shows OFFLINE when away from any wifi. Due to missing basic options in SETTINGS.On my OnePlus 5 phone I can find no way to turn on data saver, only can access and turn Mobile data on or off, which makes no difference. I get OFFLINE when wifi is turned off, or when I'm away from any wifi access, basically anywhere, since around here (California) all wifi needs a password.Tech support at OnePlus is not helpful, skirting questions, only offering ""reset the phone to original factory settings before any applications were installed"". However, this has happened on this OnePlus 5 since new, so I see no point in resetting to the same as when I got it when it was happening then as well. There's been no updates to the OS. or system since I got it.I found a possible fix online, which had the same problem but on a different android phone. He says: "" The Data Usage setting for the ‘xx' app was set to restricted.  I removed the restriction and it fixed the problem.""So, I went to  Settings/Apps/data usage/unrestricted data usage (turned on, was off) on DOZENS of applications. (allows unrestricted data access when Data Saver is on)) HOWEVER, still goes into OFFLINE when wifi is turned off... I have no answer, anyone have one?chatting with oneplus tech support, They fail to answer questions, ignoring specific questions, just giving vague path to solutions, and none of them work due to not enough details, and missing options on the phone:F_Bill_WvCSDec 1, 10:45 CST""A hard reset restores the device to the state it was in when it left the factory.“ and it has been doing it since I got it.

I'm wondering if there's anything you can do about them? Perhaps a software update?1. I can't receive any SMS or text message that contains a picture. In fact I don't get any message that contains a picture but get a warning that keeps happening reporting that was not able to receive it. And no idea where it came from or who sent it, or when it was sent. I had to disable notifications.2. There is a problem with the Flash: when taking a picture particularly a close up where there is high contrast. The Flash will highlight the white parts or lighter parts of the picture and the darker parts are even darker. The camera flash increases the contrast too much.Thank you.{THEY RESPONDED WITH: DO A HARD RESET.}","December 6, 2017"

Device is still stuck on Android 7.1 when it's supposed to be at 8.1, getting beta for 9.0.  Camera is lackluster in dim lighting even when I turn on the flash.Conclusion- this is my first day of using the phone, so perhaps I'll get an update on the next couple of days, which will hopefully help with the battery life and camera performance.","December 5, 2018"

One Plus 5 A5000 Factory Unlocked Dual Sim Dual Camera - US Vesion - Midnight Black (8GB+128GB),Billtech66,2.0,"I got my first OP5 directly from the OnePlus website expecting a Nexus/Pixel style experience based on hype and very bad information provided by tech sites like XDA that seem to be more interested in selling (certain) phones than in providing readers with accurate and useful information.The headphone jack on my OP5 was completely unusable after just 3 months--even the slightest phone movement would result in noise.  A month later the rest of my OP5 stopped working as well.  So after 4 months, my brand new OP5 was already little more than a very expensive paperweight.OnePlus customer service is so bad it's almost surreal.  For three days I couldn't get anybody at OnePlus to even acknowledge that their phone had a manufacturer's warranty.  Different customer service people just kept insisting that the 15 day return period had passed so there was nothing they could do for me.  There was an RMA option on the OnePlus website but it never seemed to be working.  On the fourth day, someone finally admitted that there was, in fact, a warranty and I began the OnePlus RMA process.  This resulted in being without the OP5 for 6 weeks.  The authorized warranty repair center in Texas stated that the motherboard, headphone jack, and USB port were all defective on my phone but rather than sending me a new phone they replaced everything.  Unfortunately, when I finally got the phone back I quickly discovered that the repair center hadn't reconnected the screen properly and there were now flickering vertical green lines running through the display.OnePlus customer service had no interest in repairing my phone after I got it back in an unusable state from their repair center so I filed an insurance claim and paid $150 deductible just so I would actually have a working phone.  I was sent a brand new replacement OP5 the next day.  The headphone jack on the replacement OP5 was defective out of the box--any standard headphone plug would immediately fall out of the jack.In 20+ years of owning various phones, the OP5 is the only one I have ever owned that had a defective motherboard, USB port or headphone jack.  I ended up with two brand new OP5 phones with defective headphone jacks after never previously owning any phone in any price range with that problem.OnePlus cut a lot of corners to get flagship specs into a lower cost phone and the end result is a phone that doesn't feel like a flagship or for that matter a $600 phone.  The OP5 feels like cheap Chinese junk.  The hardware specs are definitely impressive but a $150 Samsung J3 has far superior build quality.Then there's Oxygen which is frequently mischaracterized as being very close to stock Android.  It is true that Oxygen doesn't have a heavy-handed skin like Samsung and Xiaomi phones but Oxygen is only superficially similar to stock Android.  Oxygen is filled with so much code that doesn't meet basic Android standards that there are frequent problems with third-party apps (any app not written specifically for Oxygen).  One month an Oxygen update broke third-party camera apps.  This month an Oxygen update reportedly broke custom launchers.  A popular app can stop working properly after a Play Store update or an Oxygen update.  Oxygen requires never-ending bug fixes since it doesn't conform to Android coding standards.  The OnePlus version of Oreo, for instance, contains a lot of Nougat code that shouldn't be there.  When an app from the Play Store thinks you are running Oreo but your phone is actually running a Frankenstein blend of Oreo and Nougat that is inevitably going to lead to problems which is the reason Oxygen receives bug fixes every month.The OP5 was only on the market for 4 months and making a unified ROM with the 5T appears to be impossible so many developers abandoned the OP5 after Nougat.  Much of the development that's left is artificially sustained by OnePlus.  Developers who want a free OP6 maintain development for the OP5.  But if you follow Telegram, Google+, and tech sites you find that most of the developers still supporting the OP5 don't actually use it.  Even the XDA writer who claimed the OP5 was one of his favorite phones ever stopped using his after the 5T and Pixel 2XL came out.  Unfortunately, most of his readers don't have the same luxury.  And even though that XDA writer praised Oxygen as being like stock Android only better (seriously?) when he dusts off his OP5 it's actually running LOS, not Oxygen.  I wonder why that might be?If you plan to use TWRP and stay encrypted consider yourself warned--OnePlus regularly screws up the decryption keys.  TWRP will be working fine then one day it can't decrypt your data.  You can't simply boot back into the system like on other phones because of the way OnePlus implements encryption.  Your only option is to format the data on your phone which wipes everything and then start over from scratch.  OnePlus has screwed up decryption for TWRP users 3 or 4 times since the fall.Another potentially useful tidbit for flashers that tech writers never seem to mention--Oxygen is so heavily modded that a kernel made for Oxygen will not boot up any other type of Android ROM.  That means custom kernel developers need to make two separate kernels--one for OOS based ROMs and another for Android-based ROMs.  Most DEVs don't want the hassle so there are only a few kernels that can be flashed with non-OOS ROMs and only one where the DEV will actually provide support.Then there's spyware.  Last year a programmer found that Oxygen included a secret data collecting program that users were never told about or allowed to opt out of.  It wasn't harvesting the kind of data that Google, Apple, and Microsoft collects.  OnePlus collected enough data to clone your phone.  When caught OnePlus promised to remove the spyware.  They waited until the next monthly update and instead of removing it changed the name of the spyware program so phone owners wouldn't know what to disable.  When caught again OnePlus finally removed the spyware.Then a program was found on OnePlus phones that allowed anyone with physical access to a OnePlus phone to hack it.  OnePlus claimed it was just a Qualcuum diagnostic program that had been left by accident.  There actually was such a program but Qualcuum said the one found on OnePlus phones wasn't theirs.Then an open beta build for the OP3 was found to have a clipboard app that secretly transmitted data to servers in China.  OnePlus claimed it was an accident, denied that it was spyware anyway and instead characterized the data harvesting as a ""feature"" intended for Chinese customers even though OnePlus sells virtually no phones in China.  There's no point because OnePlus phone designs are copied from Oppo which is a huge phone brand in China.The OP5 is definitely a fast phone.  It's not as smooth as a Pixel but not that far off--as long as you are running Oxygen.  Custom ROMs don't run as quickly or smoothly as Oxygen because they are still stuck using OnePlus firmware with its non-standard coding.  Battery life is generally excellent but a background service can start acting up (especially after an Oxygen update) that causes excessive battery drain.  The only remedy is a complete factory reset of the phone and clean install of apps (not from a Google cloud backup).  I had to factory reset my OP5 more times in 5 months than my Nexus 6P and Pixel XL combined over a period of two and a half years.  The OP5 also charges quickly but uses a proprietary technology called Dash Charge that only works with the official OnePlus cable and charger.  Call quality and Bluetooth audio are both inferior to my outdated Nexus 6P.Because of its poor software, the OP5 takes surprisingly lousy pictures despite having impressive camera hardware.  Many OP5 owners were using the ported Google Pixel camera app instead of the stock camera app.  Since the Oreo update, however, the OP5 needs to be rooted to use the Pixel Camera app because bypassing the non-standard OnePlus camera HALs is currently necessary.I would never consider buying another OnePlus phone.  Unless your primary focus is on hardware specs you can definitely find something better.","March 21, 2018"

One Plus 5 A5000 Factory Unlocked Dual Sim Dual Camera - US Vesion - Midnight Black (8GB+128GB),Mr. Ed,4.0,"I am an android geek and an enthusiast for many years. I have rooted phones, written xposed modules and am deeply familiar with android phones. I have moved on, though. All i now want is a good stable, responsive phone. Coming from LG G3, i narrowed my choices to Axon 7, Honor 8 and OnePlus 5 (based on true value). I don't believe there are many other choices.I read numerous reviews on each of these phones, however, i want to decide for myself. Bought all 3 phones and used it as daily driver for a week. I am not gonna bore you with all with processors/technical specs/etc. Phone Arena has those info.Here's my summarized version on usability of the phones.Axon 7Pro:+ Best value for the money among all three phones.+ ZTE is very generous; they don't skimp on anything; Phone comes with everything; including a case, extra set of screen protector.+ Phone is snappy; not many junk Apps; can even disable most of the junk;+ ZTE Custom UI is decent (not great); but customizable+ Dual Sim; but one of slot is either SD card or 2nd sim+ Excellent speaker; although i rarely use it. I always use headphones, so this feature really didn't tip the scale.+ Wifi Calling and VOLTE are available.Con:- Slow fingerprint reader for unlocking the phone. In my opinion, this is a serious flaw since you will be constantly unlocking the phone. Even though you might overlook this flaw initially, it will get to you after some time.- Cellular bands are not wide. Works well with GSM carriers in USA (like TMobile, AT&T etc). Does not work with CDMA. However, if you want to take your phone over seas (asian countries) not all LTE bands are compatible- Among the three, this is the heaviest phone. Also, phone is slightly big to use it in 1 hand.Honor8 (FRD L04):Pro:+ Best looking phone. Phone feels very slippery. I was afraid i might drop the phone.+ Very fast and good finger print reader. Best of all, you can customize few commands in the reader.+ Good customizable UI. Best part is, you can dim the screen for reading, will be easy on your eyes.Con:- This is NOT a dual sim phone. This phone may have a slot to put the second sim. The phone sold in usa does not have dual sim support in OS.- The cellular bands are not wide. Works well with GSM Networks in USA (like TMobile, AT&T, etc). Not with CDMA. However, if you want to take your phone over seas (asian countries), not all LTE bands are compatible- Junk apps- no WiFi calling available.OnePlus 5:Pro:+ Phone is lighter than Axon7+ Broadest Cellular band. Works well with all GSM Carrier in USA; And, if you plan to take it to asian countries, it works well with all GSM carriers there as well.+ Dual Sim; Also, you can dim the screen for reading, will be easy on your eyes+ BEST of all; insanely fast fingerprint reader; The fastest phone, by far. Has the largest RAM, 6GB; fastest processor.+ Closest to the native android experience. Not many bloatwares+ Wifi Calling available; so is VOLTE.Con:- Phone is the same size as Axon7; big for one hand; but much lighter than Axon 7- No SD Card slot- Most expensive of all 3- Compared to ZTE (see Axon 7 above) OnePlus is very cheap. Phone comes with wall charger and a cable, that it. No ear phones, nothing.- Not many UI customization available;- WORST Customer Service. This takes the cake, when it comes to bad customer service.In summary, it all came down to finger print reader. The delay in reading and unlocking the phone will slowly get on your nerves. If you do not care about dual sim (or broadest cellular band), Honor 8 is a good choice. However, if you want dual sim and the fastestfinger print reader, you may have to choose OnePlus 5. I know i will hate OnePlus customer service. I may buy square trade warranty just to avoid talking to OnePlus.","July 2, 2017"
One Plus 5 A5000 Factory Unlocked Dual Sim Dual Camera - US Vesion - Midnight Black (8GB+128GB),Gabriel,5.0,"I would very highly recommend the Oneplus 5 to anyone! I have been and Android user since 2008 until the iPhone 7 plus launched. I switched to the iP7+ in September 2016 mainly because of the camera. I haven't been able to do anything with my phone outside of the standard call, texts, and browsing since because iOS is a garbage OS that can't even properly manage files, the single most basic operation of an operating system.I purchased the Oneplus 5 in hopes that I wouldn't be losing much in the way of hardware quality coming from the iPhone as the one thing Apple does right is the premium build of the iPhone. I checked out the Galaxy S8+ but it feels like a cheap toy compared to the iPhone 7 plus.After a couple of days all I can say about the Oneplus 5 is... WOW. The build quality is at least on par with the iPhone, aside from water proofing. Thanks to Android and of course the Snapdragon 835 + 6GB RAM (I have the 6GB/64GB model) the Oneplus is waaaay faster than my iPhone 7 plus. The screen is much more vivid than the iPhone and can be adjusted to your color preferences. The notification slider is much more useful than the iPhone's simple on/off toggle. The fingerprint reader on the Oneplus 5 is a lot more accurate than the iPhone and so fast that you think theres no way it read your print, but you try another finger and it doesn't come on lol, so it must have.The thing that most amazes me is that I can take much better pictures with the Oneplus 5 than the iPhone 7 plus.. I did not expect that! In both low light and outdoors with the rear and front cameras, my Oneplus 5 is better than my iPhone 7 plus hands down. The portrait mode on the Oneplus also works much better than on the iPhone as it allows for a wider range of distance between you and your subject.Oxygen OS, the default Android version that is preinstalled is wonderful. I anticipated flashing LineageOS or helping port AOSPA to this device but I have to say that I will continue using Oxygen OS becuase it is fast, bloat free and thoughtfully designed.Also, I have not noticed any of the jelly scrolling that other users have pointed out.I don't know where it goes from here, how does a device get any better?","July 27, 2017"

One Plus 5 A5000 Factory Unlocked Dual Sim Dual Camera - US Vesion - Midnight Black (8GB+128GB),Turner,5.0,"The best phone I've ever used. Apps and games open and load instantly. I've used iPhones and Samsung Galaxys and this phone blows it out of the park for half the price. 8 gb of ram is ridiculous, and 128gb of memory is more than you'll ever need.","March 7, 2018"

OnePlus 5 A5000 6GB RAM / 64GB Slate Gray Factory Unlocked USA Version,Andrew,5.0,I did a ton of research when I needed a new phone. I always get unlocked phones to use on any GSM carrier. I am currently using Cricket wireless and I get LTE everywhere. I was coming from an LG G5 RS988 which was a great phone but not with a cracked screen. I needed something with an awesome chipset and a great screen. Not too big though. This for the bill. The front mounted fingerprint scanner and hardware back and recent buttons are what really attracted me to this device. No need to lift the phone to unlock it and more screen real estate without soft nav buttons. This phone is still being updated with security patches from OnePlus and the open beta supports project treble. There's a ton of software development for this phone as well if you want a custom ROM or kernel. I'm running the most current OxygenOs release with a custom kernel and the battery life is amazing! The cameras take great pictures and the watermark is an awesome feature. I am completely satisfied with this purchase!,"July 9, 2018"
OnePlus 5 A5000 6GB RAM / 64GB Slate Gray Factory Unlocked USA Version,Kindle Customer,3.0,"GPS is wildly inaccurate and slow and the texts sometimes just don't send. In addition, sometimes the skin switches from Google to Oneplus without any input from me.Performance is good. Takes good quality pictures. Love the design and how light it feels. Good screen.","October 30, 2018"
OnePlus 5 A5000 6GB RAM / 64GB Slate Gray Factory Unlocked USA Version,Andrew,5.0,"For the price, the features are pretty great. The camera is fantastic, battery life is great with careful monitoring and use, and I love the option to have a button on the side bar to switch between loud, silent and do not disturb modes. Smooth functioning and great memory. In the US, this works well with T mobile 4g LTE , although I recommend leaving VoLTE options on to get extra boost in places with bad signal.","August 6, 2018"
OnePlus 5 A5000 6GB RAM / 64GB Slate Gray Factory Unlocked USA Version,Kindle Customer,2.0,"Note I have not used the fingerprint reader or face recognition features to unlock phone. So those are left at 0 stars.I received my Oneplus 5 on the 16th of March. Upon opening it it came with the dash charger plugin, dash charger USB-C cord, sim pin, and a few sponsored ads for low cost cellular data plans. I charged it up from 0% to 100 before using it, and the phone worked fine until the 2nd charge and reboot. After that it suffered from the infamous system freeze ups and reboots and persisted from stock ROM all the way to the official 9.0.4 OTA update, as well as custom AOSP ROMs after unlocking and rooting the phone. The manufacturer site says it is one of the best budget phones for playing games but I cannot even use it to browse the web since it freezes up, screen turns black, which forces me to force reboot it by holding the power button. I waited a month to review to see if it was just the buggy OxygenOS updates Oneplus pushes but it seems it is both that and a dud of a phone as nothing fixes the constant crashing and rebooting. Before I unlocked the bootloader and rooted this phone I went through all the steps Oneplus recommended to fix the issues. Such as flashing the recent official OTA and then clearing all the cache partitions and rebooting but nothing worked. So after that process failed I tried to see if using AOSP custom ROMs would alleviate the problem but it hasn't.Going to the Oneplus forums it appears there are many customers who have the same problem but no real answers on how to fix it from Oneplus themselves, just recommendations to go into the stock recovery, clear the system cache, flash the official OTA update and reboot. I was going to return this phone but it is past its warranty so I guess I am just going to use it until I can order a new phone from a different brand.","April 19, 2019"
OnePlus 5 A5000 6GB RAM / 64GB Slate Gray Factory Unlocked USA Version,Bee,4.0,This phone easily rivals many top brands. There is no doubt about it.I should have ordered the One Plus 6 now that I have experienced the quality of the the 5. I could lay out the individual amenities but no. More storage would be nice but I like the price as is. Try it.,"September 7, 2018"

OnePlus 5 A5000 6GB RAM / 64GB Slate Gray Factory Unlocked USA Version,Tommie Sanders,5.0,"I'm honestly so sad I recently broke this phone. I had always used older generations iPhones or other androids and they always got the job done, but sometimes there would be a lot of lagging. The one plus has been the smoothest phone that I've had and I was a big fan of the quickness of the face recognition and the video in video option so I can see two applications at once. The biggest downside was finding a case that didn't mess with the touch screen because the screen is covered. On top of this, their website doesn't offer a case for this phone anymore so I ended up not finding one that works and eventually dropped my phone and broke it. Overall, good product though that's reliable.","September 4, 2020"
