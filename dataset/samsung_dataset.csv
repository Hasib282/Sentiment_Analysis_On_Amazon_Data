"SAMSUNG Galaxy A15 5G A Series Cell Phone, 128GB Unlocked Android Smartphone, AMOLED Display, Expandable Storage, Knox Security, Super Fast Charging, US Version, 2024, Blue Black",Amazon Customer,5.0,This phone is amazing I got one for my 13 year old and one for my eleven year old and I'm about to buy one for myself! Thus phone is amazingly cheap but it still works well. It has a great camera and a light weight. It is very secure and has a great scratch resistant screen. The picture on the screen was also always clear and easy to see.,"September 1, 2024"
"SAMSUNG Galaxy A15 5G A Series Cell Phone, 128GB Unlocked Android Smartphone, AMOLED Display, Expandable Storage, Knox Security, Super Fast Charging, US Version, 2024, Blue Black",Lisa Cashner,5.0,"This is a very nice phone. Samsung did a really good job on this one.The build quality is solid. The plastic case is a matte iridescent deep blackish blue and does a good job at not showing fingerprints. The AMOLED screen has good colors and perfect deep blacks. The high capacity battery (5,000mAh) lasts 7-10 days with light usage before needing to recharge. The software is typical Samsung high-quality and the Samsung-built email app is still the best amongst Android phones. The fingerprint reader on the side unlocks the phone instantaneously. The charging port is USB-C. Speed-wise, the phone is plenty fast and doesn't lag. It has 5G cell phone connectivity but you can turn it off and use 4G to save on battery life. Networking also supports 2G (i.e. GSM) that can be turned on or off. Built-in storage is a whopping 128GB. Expansion-wise, the SIM tray accepts 2 SIM cards (i.e. this is indeed a dual-SIM phone), or 1 SIM card + 1 Micro-SD card. There is a headphone jack at the bottom, next to the charging port. The phone is quite big, i.e. the screen is huge, and it's rather heavy but so are most phones nowadays. It barely fits in my pants pockets.This is marketed as an entry-level phone, but honestly, it has such much memory, long battery life, fingerprint unlock, 3 good cameras, dual-SIM, Micro-SD expansion, headphone jack, USB C, great software support, future-proof updates, and is quite fast, so you may wonder why you'd ever need to buy anything more expensive.Overall, great modern phone at a reasonable price ($200) that should work well for most people and last a long time.","April 26, 2024"
"SAMSUNG Galaxy A15 5G A Series Cell Phone, 128GB Unlocked Android Smartphone, AMOLED Display, Expandable Storage, Knox Security, Super Fast Charging, US Version, 2024, Blue Black",Amazon Customer,4.0,"I bought this for my son and so fat in two weeks he loves it. Battery life is longer than advertised. He charges it every 3 days or so. Loves watching crisp videos and playing video games. Fingerprint sensor works every-time so far. Sound is louder than my iphone 14 pro. Love the option for a wired headphone, there is also the option for bluetooth accessories. Lots of phone cases available for this model. Reason for three starts? Well there is some lag speed with having multiple apps open.","May 27, 2024"
"SAMSUNG Galaxy A15 5G A Series Cell Phone, 128GB Unlocked Android Smartphone, AMOLED Display, Expandable Storage, Knox Security, Super Fast Charging, US Version, 2024, Blue Black",Amazoner,5.0,"I decided to wait to write a review because I was on the fence about keeping it or not. My previous phone was a Samsung A10E which is not a very heavy phone. The A15 is considerably heavier which I am (still) not very comfortable with. Comparing the 2 phones as far as memory is concerned is markedly different. The A10E has 32 gigs of internal memory. The A15 has 128 gigs of internal memory. Considering that I have alot of pics on my phone with several different albums, this makes the A15 a better product. The battery life is quite good. The appearance is beautiful. I purchased the light blue phone. I have a clear cover on my phone. This is my 4th Samsung cell phone. Samsung never disappoints with quality, durability and performance. I love the Samsung Smart Switch which makes moving your data from one phone to another fast and super easy. They don't provide a SIM card or micro SD card so you need to make sure to move your cards into your new phone. The software is similar to previous Samsung phone with a few tweaks. For example, to get a screen shot for the A15 you need to press both power and volume down button simultaneously. What makes the A15 different from any of my previous Samsungs is with the A15 you have to press each twice. There is a feature that would put a floating icon on your screen and open it and tap screenshot then you will get your screenshot. Now, what sold me on the A15 is a neat feature where, upon your approval, they will block all spam/scam phone calls. So no more annoying spam/scam calls!! It's a neat feature!! Like I said, I love Samsung phones!!","May 19, 2024"

"SAMSUNG Galaxy A15 5G A Series Cell Phone, 128GB Unlocked Android Smartphone, AMOLED Display, Expandable Storage, Knox Security, Super Fast Charging, US Version, 2024, Blue Black",Lisa Cashner,3.0,"Yes it works, but I have complaints! The touch-screen is the biggest problem, it is unresponsive and inexact. VERY INEXACT. The battery life is pretty good, but not as good as my Moto-G. And it gets really bad call reception in my area if it's not set to wi-fi calling. I do live in a very remote location, but still, what the heck? My old phone worked! My husband's phone works! It's a phone, shouldn't its primary function be making and receiving calls? (Oh, I just betrayed my age, didn't I?)That's all my complaints. Those caveats aside, it has good smartphone functionality and it's sturdy. It is also extremely affordable.I'm afraid I had high expectations. Because they are the premier Android brand, I expected a low-level Samsung to be at least as good as a mid-level Motorola. NO. That is NOT the case. I will be going back to a Moto-G when this phone reaches the end of its usefulness. And I will try to take better care of the next one!","August 21, 2024"

It's a very good phone and transferring data over to this phone was easy. This was one of the best purchases I have ever made. My old phone was 4G and always freezing and cutting off.  I needed a new phone and being on disability can be a hassle since I am living off of limited income, so thank you Amazon for the automatic payment plan option. Just one low down payment and 4 small monthly payments, I was able to get a new phone and the one I always wanted.  😀","August 27, 2024"
"SAMSUNG Galaxy A15 5G A Series Cell Phone, 128GB Unlocked Android Smartphone, AMOLED Display, Expandable Storage, Knox Security, Super Fast Charging, US Version, 2024, Blue Black",Cindy Kime,5.0,"For my uses this phone is a great deal.  I use it as a phone, for email, to text, to access the internet, for Zoom, to navigate, to take photos, and a bunch of lesser things like controlling my alarm system and thermometer, reading the Washington Post etc.  What I don’t do is game and social media.The most important things I want in a phone are that it does what I need, which it does, and that it be stable and robust – it’s a Samsung -- nuf said.I had been using a Samsung Galaxy J7 for the past five years but finally decided that it just didn’t have enough memory so I got the A15 which has about 4x more memory and seems perfectly adequate.  Aside from inadequate memory, my old J7 worked perfectly and still does.I see some complaints about the A15 being slow.  It seems fine for my uses, but you’ve probably guessed by now that I’m not exactly a tech expert, power user type.  I can tell you that videos and Zoom operate smoothly.  It may not work very well for high demand functions like gaming, but I wouldn’t know.I opted for the US version for $200 rather than the international version for $20 or $30 less because I didn’t want to mess around with any possible compatibility issues with my isp.  Speaking of cost: for my uses, why would I spend 4 to 6 times more for a high-end phone -- really?The battery seems fine.  I let it charge at night but it so far has never gone below 80% during an average day’s use.  The screen is large and sharp and the cameras seem to do a fine job.  I could only wish that it was smaller and lighter and that it had cordless charging but for the price I’m not complaining.FYI:  The phone weighs 7.57 oz (0.47lbs) and the dimensions are 6 ¼”  x  3”","August 20, 2024"
"SAMSUNG Galaxy A15 5G A Series Cell Phone, 128GB Unlocked Android Smartphone, AMOLED Display, Expandable Storage, Knox Security, Super Fast Charging, US Version, 2024, Blue Black",randall s morris,4.0,"I got this smartphone as an alternative to a.) Getting my iPhone 12 pro scrubbed.b.) buying another iPhone.To explain, I got hacked while using my iPhone and my bank wanted me to get it scrubbed in case there was some sort of malware on it. So rather than driving 40 minutes and paying $190 to get that done along with the paperwork certifying it was done, I just bought a brand new Samsung A-15 from Amazon. It performs well and satisfied my bank. Price is probably the .ain't factor in my purchasing this phone. I think I owned a Galaxy S-21 before, and I like this A-15 better. It has no water resistance, one speaker, but it has decent cameras and is fast enough loading internet sites. It's a tad big and heavy, but the + side is a larger screen. There is no inductive charging, but it uses a 25 watt charger that makes charging relatively fast. Also, the battery lasts a long time. I think it's 5000 miliamps. I've had it last over 3 days, so that's a plus. If you are an iOS user and have Apple Mail, that can be challenging, but once you set everything up, it's no big deal.","August 20, 2024"
"SAMSUNG Galaxy A15 5G A Series Cell Phone, 128GB Unlocked Android Smartphone, AMOLED Display, Expandable Storage, Knox Security, Super Fast Charging, US Version, 2024, Blue Black",Amazon Customer,4.0,"I purchased this phone to replace a Samsung phone from 2015.  It is definitely much faster.  My only complaint is it does not have the same sound notifications, which I miss.  There are some nice features like using biometrics to quickly access information.  I have yet to spend time taking photos, but I have heard from someone else that the camera is not as good as the old phone.","August 27, 2024"
"SAMSUNG Galaxy A15 5G A Series Cell Phone, 128GB Unlocked Android Smartphone, AMOLED Display, Expandable Storage, Knox Security, Super Fast Charging, US Version, 2024, Blue Black",Lisa Cashner,5.0,"I've always purchased budget phones and my TCL 30 SE phone battery swelled up and cracked the back of the case off. So decided to give the Samsung Galaxy A15 phone a try. I like the build quality of the phone it feels solid and with 5g data and amoled display it's worth the price. It has everything I want in a phone. I don't open a lot of web page tabs so it fast enough for me. It's the four years of Android upgrades that sold me on this phone. My last phone didn't last two years before the battery problem. I hope this phone last long enough to receive all the Android upgrade. The power button is a little hard to press, but the fingerprint sensor works great. I really like this phone and highly recommend this budget phone.","August 7, 2024"

The first one outlasted the phone which aged out after five years. It was still protecting the phone as well as the first day I ever used it when the phone was replaced.When it came time to get a case for the new phone, I never considered anything else. This one checks all the boxes.","August 31, 2024"
"SAMSUNG Galaxy A15 5G A Series Cell Phone, 128GB Unlocked Android Smartphone, AMOLED Display, Expandable Storage, Knox Security, Super Fast Charging, US Version, 2024, Blue Black",Michael,4.0,"Great storage, very responsive, sleek-looking Samsung phone. Can run most apps with little to no issues. However, while the Samsung A15 5G is completely ready for RCS and Native Video Calling, it is locked out by default. If you try to contact ATT/T-Mobile/Sprint, they will tell you that only their carrier-branded phones support these features. The current workaround is to use Shizuku+System UI Tuner to enable IMS Settings to turn on Native Video Calling (Samsung/Green Phone app) as well as all the RCS features. It is a shame that these features are turned off by default because we already pay so much money for these phones and data plans, and now they add more restrictions. Very good phone for the price otherwise.","July 10, 2024"

"SAMSUNG Galaxy A15 5G A Series Cell Phone, 128GB Unlocked Android Smartphone, AMOLED Display, Expandable Storage, Knox Security, Super Fast Charging, US Version, 2024, Blue Black",Gary,4.0,"After being an Apple customer for several years, I am starting to get tired of constantly having to get a new phone at a cost of about $1000 every few years. My phones tend to last longer than the software upgrades allow. I still have a working iPhone 3GS that can be used. I even bought a SIMM conversion kit to test it. It still works, but not much good for anything else but playing my music library.This phone is my delve into the Android world, and at a little over $200 this phone seems to work great. I only did the basic setup, and haven’t logged it into any accounts like Google or Samsung, but I can insert the SIMM card, and use it like an old fashioned phone, should my aging iPhone 8 fail on me. Right now, I am trying to decide about whether to shell out for another Apple product or just go with Samsung, like a lot of others have done, according to recent news about how Apple is losing market share to Samsung.After I get a chance to play around with the phone a little more, I will probably update this review.","May 17, 2024"

"SAMSUNG Galaxy A15 5G A Series Cell Phone, 128GB Unlocked Android Smartphone, AMOLED Display, Expandable Storage, Knox Security, Super Fast Charging, US Version, 2024, Blue Black",Geodenizen,2.0,"I always need a backup phone. My main phone ( Moto stylus 5g) dropped and had to order a new screen. My backup phone died so, I bought this Galaxy A15 since it would get to me the next day. I thought getting a Galaxy would be great with the brand reputation. I realize this is entry level for this family of phones, but did expect a little better. Here is the good:1. The Samsung UI is intuitive and is willing to take on tasks and minimize effort for logging in and anything related to accounts.2. Setup was easy with the Samsung UI.The not so good:1. It has to think about loading something when you try to open an app. I was able to grab my laptop log in and start typing before it loaded the app.2. It will say you are offline even when connected to WiFi or cell. You may have to close then relaunch the browser multiple times for it to load.3. the UI gives you a message that you will have to reboot the phone often to keep it working correctly. I know a little about computers and know that the file system will apply updates and such to ensure it is working right however, I found I had to reboot this one multiple times in a day to get it to open apps or connect. There were no error messages or indications of hardware issues. It was new in the box.4. I bought a Moto G 5G as a backup, which is in the same price range as the A15 and it; setup, connected and navigated apps without issues or delays. The performance difference was notable.I have read many reviews with the same result from users regarding the A15.I was able to install the new screen for my Stylus G, while it is slightly higher level than the A15, it hadno issues with speed or connectivity the same as the Moto G 5G.Summary:  The A15 performs lower than comparable phones so, if you are looking for a low mid range phone, other than a dedicated Samsung fan, it would benefit you to either upgrade to a higher level Galaxy or shop for a different brand in this price range.Hope this helps.","September 2, 2024"

The box was open and crushed,  and the block number list had a lot of numbers added to it.  Messaging doesn't seem to work.  Everything else is fine,  I'm getting used to the latest software.  The soundcard is good,  which is what I care about and why I went back to Samsung.After testing , it can't use Google's speed test and had a problem scrolling one of my emails; other speed tests and emails worked.  This occurred on multiple browsers.  My old Samsung phones used google's test and scrolled the same email without problem as usual.  This probably displays a glitch in the latest Android or Samsung software.  I'm hoping it's not about the phone's hardware.","April 27, 2024"

It does very well in the daytime but lacks at night.It is a little slow if you have a bunch of apps on it.  For a secondary/budget phone, this is a great deal (I got it for $170).My primary is an A54 and I would recommend that over this phone.  BUT... if you do decide to get the A15, understand that it is a budget phone that can do all the basic things you need.Overall, for the price, it does have many features that are attractive.  I would get a 128gb micro SD card that's A1, V30, and U1.  It'll be decent for apps.Edit: I wanted to mention that this DOES work with T-Mobile.  If you want to check compatibility, go to your phone carrier and see if you can purchase the phone through them.  If you can't, then that means the A15 is not supported.","March 17, 2024"

"SAMSUNG Galaxy A15 5G A Series Cell Phone, 128GB Unlocked Android Smartphone, AMOLED Display, Expandable Storage, Knox Security, Super Fast Charging, US Version, 2024, Blue Black",Stuart Strausbaugh,2.0,"I bought the Samsung Galaxy, the description said unlocked. And compatible with my carrier which was MetroPCS. When I got the phone and try to activate it my carrier MetroPCS said it was locked by another carrier and wanted a $30 fee to unlock it. Or to call Amazon to see if they could call the carrier that it was locked by and have them unlock it. I had no success with that. So I returned the phone. I then but another Samsung phone of the same model, with the same description as being unlocked from Amazon. I bought a second replacement phone and that phone was also locked by another carrier. And a $30 fee was required to unlock it by my carrier. So both phones were locked when I bought them. If I would have been told that there was to be a unlock fee from my carrier in the first place I would have kept the first phone and just paid to have it unlocked. Not knowing this information from Amazon, and a incorrect description of phone and misinformation, cost me time and money for almost a month, waiting on a return of my money and in the meantime I had no phone. So phones that say unlocked are almost definitely locked. And a fee from your carrier will be needed to unlock it. And paid by the buyer. The phone I bought as a replacement after sending the first locked phone back was also locked. I ended up buying the same model Galaxy phone at a higher price , I also had to pay for unlock fee. The ram was lower, 4 gigs vs 6 gigs than the original one I purchased. So because of misinformation and bad description, the overall situation of the purchase was very very bad. The Galaxy phone itself seemed to be running fine so far. But because of low ram at 4 GB, it seems to lag when scrolling.","August 30, 2024"
"SAMSUNG Galaxy A15 5G A Series Cell Phone, 128GB Unlocked Android Smartphone, AMOLED Display, Expandable Storage, Knox Security, Super Fast Charging, US Version, 2024, Blue Black",DK,3.0,"After having the Samsung galaxy A15 5g for over 6 months now I can say it's not a bad deal for under 200 bucks. The performance on it has been slower over the months, but nothing too bad yet. It has 128 gb of internal storage, which for me is plenty. The sound quality on the speaker isn't anything amazing, but it works well. Although I do hate the placement of it at the bottom of the phone, it gets covered easily and muffles the sound. The picture quality is pretty, way better than my last phone. The thing I probably love about it the most is the display. I didn't think I would care that much about the display, but every time I look at someone else's phone I only then realize how much of a difference it makes. All in all if your looking for a reliable phone under 200, this is probably the best deal.","July 18, 2024"

Could not find setting to change so set it up similar to older phone.  After about a week contacted Samsung about it and received a call back.  After resetting to factory settings I could change the display to 4 or 5 wide.  Then able to set up icons and widgets to give the desired spacing.  I then had to reload all my apps and go through all the settings again.All the other issues I have had have been with the changes from older software to the latest versions, not with the phone itself.  Samsung did add extraneous apps, some of which could not be deleted so I did a force stop on them.  The first update brought them back so had to turn off automatic updates, then allow or block updates individually since then.Would prefer to have the 256 gig memory of the non-US veersion but did not want to give up the warranty.  If they did not include the unwanted apps that would help the memory go further.Had for a month, mostly satisfied.","May 28, 2024"

I'll manage replacing those apps but the biggest disappointment is for my lionel wifi camera caboose! The apk/app isn't compatible! Very disappointing!

It takes quite a few tries, loosing what you want to screenshot happens often. As an older person I screenshot things I can't read so I can zoom in. I try to avoid that now. *No sd card storage to remove or replace. I miss that, even though the phone has lots of available room. I use to save the sd cards for personal back up photos.*Sim card slot looks as if it won't securely hold in the tray. Isn't a tight fit, but suprisingly it does work with some patience.A month into use,It's a good phone so far!","June 13, 2024"

"SAMSUNG Galaxy A15 5G A Series Cell Phone, 128GB Unlocked Android Smartphone, AMOLED Display, Expandable Storage, Knox Security, Super Fast Charging, US Version, 2024, Blue Black",KP,2.0,"I bought this phone because of all the good reviews and that it was affordable.  I had had bad experiences with Samsung phones in the past, but I thought maybe they had improved.  I was disappointed.Within a couple of days, when I was trying to type out texts, I found that even if I very carefully pushed on a letter that I wanted, another letter, or number, or word would show up in the text box.  I would have to re-start the phone to get it to work again.  And that was not all.  Other times the screen would start jittering badly, or quickly shifting back and forth between two apps when I wasn't even touching it.This behavior has persisted.  Due to this problem, I have to re-start the phone on the average every two days, but there have been a few times whey I've had to do it three or four times in one day.Also, I'm not sure why the default setting for the screen is ""gestures"".  This was very frustrating because I could only remember a few basic gestures, so I could never do things like bring up the screen with all of the open apps, as well as having other things happen that I didn't want to happen when I tried certain swipe gestures. I finally got sick of this problem, and looked it up on the internet and found where there was a way to get three buttons at the bottom of the screen - one for ""back a screen"", one for the ""home"" screen"" and one to open the window allowing you to scroll through (and close) open apps individually - or close them all with one button.The battery saving feature takes a while to get it right.  This feature keeps you from over-charging it, and stops the charging when the battery gets to 85% full.  For the first few weeks, this resulted in me sometimes running out of power before my day was through.  This feature has some king of AI support, I think, and it has gotten better over time.  It still says it only gets 85% full, but it usually lasts a whole day unless I am using it very heavily.Otherwise, the phone seems to work well, but the screen problem is bad enough that I can only give this a two star rating.","May 10, 2024"

Had to redo my fingerprint just for that to not work really either...- Not sure if it's my phone carrier, but literally cannot text in a group chat if there's more than 10 people...- Color isn't what it says to me. It's supposed to be a cute, reflective blue and it doesn't even look blue in the slightest, but not too mad about it. Just a little disappointed.- Just my slight with Samsung phones, but I hate the voicemail setup. I much prefer Apple or Google's way of reviewing individual voicemails along with the day they were sent instead of having to listen through all of the menu options and voicemails with no way to tell when they were sent..Overall:I'm not sure I'd recommend this phone, at least not for $200. I tried out the Moto power 5g 2023 and I actually preferred it over this phone. While it was taller, it was slimmer and easier to hold.

The phone worked fine with other family members and friends on my Favorite list. All settings were the same. I called my carrier and it was not their problem. I then called Samsung support. I spent 65 minutes trying to translate a heavy East Asian accent. To make matters worse, he shared a room with, I'm guessing, 10 - 25 people. Between the accent and the talking in the background, it was very difficult to understand each other on both ends. I was asked at least four times the reason I was calling. Duh. At the end of our conversation it was left up to me to use the phone and see if the problem was resolved, and if not, to call back. Huh!? The solution? I have to keep both the Do Not Disturb and the Sleep features turned off in order for the phone to ring for those three people!!!  There might be more people who haven't called me during this first month that won't get through when they call. That remains to be seen over time. I'm two days past the Amazon refund date. My bad.

Another very disappointing thing is that the tweaking software made for Galaxy phones, Good Lock, is not available on the Galaxy store.  The substitute version, Fine Lock, is available on Google Play but the app is empty of modules.  A search online suggests that this phone is too low end for Samsung to include access to this app.  Ugh.  I am no expert on cell phones, but my last phone, a TCL, worked much better than this new Samsung.  The TCL had voicemails available without having to log into a voicemail center to retrieve them.

I even tried to time my swipe with timing of the changes on the web page, but was unsuccessful.I'm not sure how much of the blames goes to Android 14 (vs 11 on my Motorola's).

"SAMSUNG Galaxy A35 5G A Series Cell Phone, 128GB Unlocked Android Smartphone, AMOLED Display, Advanced Triple Camera System, Expandable Storage, Rugged Design, US Version, 2024, Awesome Navy",R.T.,5.0,"I've had my Samsung Galaxy A35 for just over one month. I looked at a lot of reviews before pulling the trigger and I shopped a few brands.1st - 4 Android upgrades (1/yr) and 5 years of security patches CAN'T BE BEAT at this price point.2nd - IP67 dust/water resistant (up to 1m for 30 min).Great screen (Super AMOLED, 120Hz, 1000 nits) and the adaptive brightness works super well (High Brightness Mode). Solid build with Victus Glass front and rear on a plastic frame. 5000 mAh battery and 25W charging give longevity and fast top ups. The 5nm Exynos 1380 chipset has 4x2.4 GHz & 4x2.0 GHz processors along with 6GB RAM, 128GB internal storage and micro SDXC slot. Plenty of power and storage under the hood for all except maybe the hardcore power users and game junkies. A fantastic all-around phone for most users. Fingerprint reader under the screen works great providing accurate and fast access to the device. Stereo speakers have plenty of volume and a pleasing tone for streaming videos. Audiophiles will want quality ear buds regardless of the speakers. The sound is well tuned for normal use. Calls are clear and trouble free.I don't really do selfies; the front camera is 13MP of acceptable. Not horrible, not wow.Let's talk triple rear cameras. 50 MP, f/1.8, (wide) with PDAF (phase detection auto focus) and OIS (optical image stabilization - way better then electronic image stabilization) + 8 MP, f/2.2 (ultrawide) + 5 MP, f/2.4, (macro). Like their displays, Samsung also makes their own camera sensors and know what they are about in both departments. In my experience, the biggest limiter on phone cameras is the controlling software. Here Samsung gives you acceptable level software. No brand name glass (like Zeiss or Leica) for the lenses. The cameras are solidly utilitarian and get the job done with enough power to give you some creative wiggle room. Those who know how can tweak their pictures by learning the strengths and weaknesses and going to post processing when needed. Unfortunately, there is no RAW support, or you could make even better progress in post. There are also several shooting modes that users might utilize to adapt to the composition of a particular image capture.The main camera operates in a 12.5MP mode by default. I went into settings > settings to keep > camera mode (switch on) so that it remembers I want the 50MP mode and saves it when I open the camera app again. There is no zoom in 50MP mode, but I'd rather crop in on more pixels than use less pixels getting degraded by digital zoom in most use case scenarios.The picture of the steering wheel detail was taken with the 5MP f/2.4 macro lens, auto settings, no post process.The two cloudscapes were captured with the main camera in 50MP mode, auto settings, no post process. You only achieve 50MP when shooting in full aspect ratio. I prefer 16:9 so those images are 37.5MP.The picture of the moon was taken in Pro mode (12.5MP) with 10x zoom, ISO 40 and -2.0ev.The picture of the $1 coin was captured with the main camera at 50MP. I used a 10x macro lens clipped in front of the main camera and did post processing in Snapseed.The picture of the moth was captured with the main camera at 12.5MP and 2x zoom. Post processed in Snapseed.All-in-all: solid value for money and a phone you likely won't upgrade from anytime soon. It has all you need to make it a faithful companion for years.Quick Update: I was out taking Milkyway photos the other night with my mirrorless camera. I did add one image to this review, taken with the A35. The photo of the trees after sunset was during the Blue Hour (low light) with the main camera in 50MP mode, auto settings, lightly edited in Snapseed. The capture was at 1/9th of a second and demonstrates the effectiveness of the Optical Image Stabilization.I was also using the Stellarium app with live view and can attest to the accuracy and responsiveness of the compass sensor on the Galaxy A35. I just keep finding more reasons to love this phone!","July 1, 2024"

"SAMSUNG Galaxy A35 5G A Series Cell Phone, 128GB Unlocked Android Smartphone, AMOLED Display, Advanced Triple Camera System, Expandable Storage, Rugged Design, US Version, 2024, Awesome Navy",Lavienrose30,5.0,"UPDATED POST (30JUN24)For some reason, the phone is very ""slippery"" when placed glass-side down.  I have set the phone face down on surfaces like a kitchen or restaurant table with and without cloth and plastic table cloths, my pant leg when I am sitting down, the keyboard  and top of my laptop when it is turned off or closed, and other materials.When placed this way, if there is ANY slight sense of not being 100% level and flat, the phone will start to creep in the direction of the slant and make it way off of the device.  This is very annoying and concerning that it may sustain damage...especially since the frame and corners are plastic.My only solution it to put it face up (yet camera side down) where is seems to create a bit more friction and not creep off of the surface.  When trying to maintain privacy, I although I WANT to place it face down, I am fearful it will slide off of the surface.SOLUTION: Getting a thin silicone skin-type case for it has solved my issue.Note: Although I say ""I"" above, it is a combination of either me or my wife, as the phone is now hers, but I use it from time to time.ORIGINAL POST :I bought this for my wife. I have a newer Samsung S-series.This phone has everything I would want.I would gladly trade my S-series for it.What it is missing, compared to my S-Series:1) Wireless charging  If I really needed that I could get this for $10  (See end of this review for Amazon  TASUMATO Wireless Charging Receiver Qi Charger Adapter link)2) Thinness A35 is thicker (0.32"" vs 0.30"")3) Maybe speed? (Not noticeable enough for me)4) Too new for Verizon to recognize5) Read ""complaints"" about speed of fingerprint reader.  To me it is not significant.6) Size  A35 is taller (6.37"" vs 5.76""  )/wider( 3.07""vs 2.79"" ) ,  I like the smaller S-Series because so it does not stick out of  my back pocket like the A35.What is has that I wish my S-Series had1) Micro SD Slot2) Less that 1/2 the price.3) Battery almost 2x as big4) Android 14 is its first OS. Which means it will be supported longer than my S-Series (release with Android 13)  with another Android O/S update.Since this is an Unlocked version, Verizon doesn't sell a similar version (even a Verizon locked version) yet, and it has only been out since Mar/APRIL 2024, I had an issue with Verizon.The only issue I had was getting a physical 5G nano SIM installed for it from the local Verizon store.I used the old Verizon 3G SIM I had (from the phone I was replacing) in this new phone until I could get to the verizon store. No issues.When the Verizon ""tech"" tried to scan the phone, it would not come up in his database. Thus he couldn't link it to the new SIM in an automated way (and he did not know how else to do it).He said ""We usually have this issue with Unlocked phones.""I think it was just because it was so new.So, he set it up via eSIM.  He did some testing and found no issues.I ran it this way for a while without issue.I also got him to give me a new blank Verizon 5G SIM. (It was no good to me unless Verizon registered it anyway).I called Verizon customer support. Since I had a blank Verizon 5G SIM, they were able to void the eSIM and get my 5G physical SIM to work over the phone.So, no real ""issues"" with Verizon, just an inconvenience.NOTE:I did not set it up with face recognition or the fingerprint reader for security reasons.WIRELESS CHARGING RECEIVER ADAPTER from AMAZON:https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Charging-Receiver-Charger-Adapter/dp/B09T9192P1/ref=sr_1_7?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.XikiZ2djR8Rm8GopWoXVrA6AtYSRHayCogLn1kB5WU1S1MxZpSygtHxk2SoP8HhoTmeYF_C9UDcXTJbQfQvHkiFALl_olKSl3jH1Kr2lBa2mHnkXagvaC0d1QDHVq2ia76qe0msNIOLPW8CEfpderibezU531235JojJLrHVl0ezvGYDTYPDr9cO3-X6l09LEsoaOhkw0GzjX5EsJIKh71KnLblw7KQ1dHYPBzj199A.YtasrLm4IwzJ-ZHKuwzoNLE3v11As-gdgSzdTnxyzf4&dib_tag=se&keywords=wireless+charging+adapter&qid=1717338850&sr=8-7","June 2, 2024"

"SAMSUNG Galaxy A35 5G A Series Cell Phone, 128GB Unlocked Android Smartphone, AMOLED Display, Advanced Triple Camera System, Expandable Storage, Rugged Design, US Version, 2024, Awesome Navy",Hank,5.0,"Coming from a Note 9 that is 5 years old I find that even though it doesn't have wireless charging and an S pen that this is a great replacement for said phone. Although I suppose upgrading from any phone that is 5 years old to one that is less than a year old would probably result in a good experience one does have to make sure to get a phone that will meet your needs. I watched multiple reviews online and read ones as well and decided that I don't really need wireless charging or an S pen for the price one has to pay to get phones with those features. Ordered a set of magnetic adapters for the cable which will make connecting and disconnecting the phone to charge much easier than having to insert it. This should help to over come the ease of wireless charging and wired charging is faster anyway even if not as convenient. The one thing that most reviews failed to mention, and perhaps it is because it has become so common on Samsung phones, is adaptive charging. This ability allows one to pick from 3 different behaviors the phone will have in relation to charging when left on the charger which is significant for over night charging. This is a feature which my old phone did not have. Based on what I researched online the worst thing you can do to shorten your battery life is leave your phone on the charger overnight if it does not have adaptive charging. When I had my note 4 I did not know this and use to leave it on the charger overnight all the time. Although with the Note 4 you could just replace the battery when it went bad by just removing it. I followed the advice of not leaving the phone on the charger overnight with my Note 9 and I guess it must have extended the life of the battery considering it has not swollen in 5 years of use. Even if it does not hold the charge as long as I would like. As far as speed I find this phone to be plenty fast for doing everyday things which is all I really want the phone for besides playing some low end games. The front finger print reader is fast enough for me, coming from a phone with the reader on the back, and has no problem unlocking my banking app as well as the password software I use. I had read that someone else couldn't use the front reader with their banking app so this was of concern for me. Have no problem using it with Mint, which uses T-Mobile towers, simply shut down phone installed sim card and SD card rebooted and was making phone calls in no time.  For me this works great as a replacement for my Note 9 and should get plenty of years of use out of it.","July 20, 2024"

I have done reboot MANY times, reset network, factory reset, manually set up with bare minimum info, nothing helped.Per usual routine when buying a Prime item shipped from Amazon I just wanted to exchange this phone that was defective upon arrival for the same phone but it was not an option. You have to wait for a refund that could take up to 30 days.If you have plenty of money and can wait great! But I had no option but to finance through Affirm.

I saw Tracfone sold the same A35 model but they could not activate this unlocked IMEI with a physical SIM that I had to buy or with the eSIM feature.  I gave up and decided I would change carriers and went to Mint Mobile next.  Mint has a somewhat deceiving compatibility check and initially showed it was compatible with their bands.  However, there is a tiny question mark to click on which shows it is not compatible with Mints 5G bands.  I'm not buying a new 5G phone just to have it at 4G so I returned it.What puzzles me is, last year I bought an unlocked US version A54 and it activates and works at 5G on both Tracfone and Mint.

Going from app to app is slow. Looking through the background apps is slow. Typing is slow - there letters on the screen are a bit behind, even when not trying to type fast. There seem to be lots of phantom touches. For example if you open a site in a browser it will start going to a hyperlink on the site before the whole page loads. Which happens SLOW even with a fast, and strong connection. The phone is supposed to have a glass back, but it feels cheap and theres flex that usually would not have with a higher end glass device. The boxy shape of the phone makes it feel bigger than it is. And its oddly heavy.  Oneplus 12r would be a better option just based on software and the speed. But with the Oneplus curved screen you have to deal with all those accidental touches. But the A35 has ghost touches while the Oneplus tends to respond faster once you try to go back.

The A35 is the perfect sweet spot when it comes to smartphones that just work. Expandable storage with a microSD card is a nice touch. I'm also really happy it doesn't have any of Samsung's new AI stuff. It runs almost all apps with little to no issues. it doesn't run higher end mobile games like CoD Mobile or Zenless Zone Zero, but things like Subway Surfers and Jetpack Joyride run perfectly fine. Battery life is excellent, I can get 1-2 days out of a single charge depending on my usage. Videos, TV shows, and other content look really good on this phone since it's got an OLED screen.

The battery on my S10 wasn't lasting very long. Honestly, I'm not impressed. It has awesome battery life and for the most part everything seems to work the way it should. However it has the worst fingerprint recognition scanner of any phone I've used. I'm having to enter the code about half of the time, and yes I've deleted the fingerprint imprint and redone it several times to the same effect.Also, even though I downloaded the UI update and installed it, it constantly says there's an update, tries to download it, halfway through it clears out the Wi-Fi password and pauses the install.  The smart transfer feature did not transfer password and logins to all of my various apps, even though another phone I got at the same time... A free phone from straight talk, copied everything perfectly.I'm sure these are all issues I will eventually overcome...

I have no screen protector that could be interfering with it. I am considering deleting everything and returning it but that is a lot of hassle. I had a very slow phone, which I used for years before this, so it's still an improvement. For $800  I would expect a phone that works as good as new. The other thing is the talk to text. Definitely.Adds periods and punctuation where it does not belong I end up having to correct a lot of what is said I left the last few sentences uncorrected, so you could see. Battery life, was good the first week And it might be the apps that I added that are sucking up the battery. I would say it's definitely the apps that are  running in the background. So I would say, overall, a good phone, but I wish the companies would test functionality a little more thoroughly, because the touchscreen is the most irritating thing to have to push on something six times to get it to respond.

P.,3.0,"Buying Samsung products is not inexpensive. With cell phones, however, one expects quality - especially as pricey as their phones are.My pro: the phone feels sturdy and comfortable in hand.My Cons:  1.  The secondary sim is an e-sim, which is not accommodated by all cell service providers.  2.  Most user choices are removed with this phone and unable to be changed in settings. Example - If you use an eSim with a physical sim, the physical sim settings are primary OVER eSim settings. This is even when the eSim is designated as the primary sim. All eSim settings are treated as secondary.  3.  Google accounts on the phone cannot be selected as primary or secondary. The phone forces the selection on users whether or not you want them that way. Example - I have a personal (for purposes of android) and work based email that each use Google. The physical sim attached to my work email / account is treated as primary OVER my personal account. Well, geez, it's my phone that I spent an enormous amount of money on.  4.  While different ringtones and notification settings are selected for each sim, AGAIN, they settings for the physical sim supersede those for the eSim.  5.  Many apps on your phone will default to the Samsung selected settings are unable to be changed.  6.  Privacy controls are NOT user editable.  Most privacy issues must be waved for use of the phone.There are many more gripes or dislikes about this phone. Bottom line, user control or preferences are removed. Further, if you use this phone to travel, wherein most users may opt to use a physical sim purchased in the respective country of travel, then expect that all settings for that physical sim will override ANY setting used for the eSim, EVEN WHEN the eSim is selected as primary.  NOT OKAY!!Samsung has already removed so many standard features from their phones such as the sd card, earphone jacks, and other things.  This is all done (seemingly) to compete with Apple.  What Samsung hasn't grasped is that Android users are not trying to be Apple users. Users selected or stayed with Android for a reason. Second, while Apple seemingly goes to great lengths to protect users privacy concerns, Samsung causes users to wave them, especially if the user wants to take advantage of their bloatware or apps.  For all these sacrifices, Samsung could have retained two things -  the use of TWO physical sim cards versus an eSim and physical and user control over their data.","March 3, 2024"

I mean this phone rocks in every way and the transition from my old s10 5g was seamless and straightforward. It literally took couple of hours from start to finish and there is no learning curve.

Going from 4 to 5 was not great an experience.Here are the problems I've had:1 - Failure to re-connect to mobile network when coming back into range when out of range. I was an hour away from our house and received a call from my wife. Signal wasn't the greatest but at least I could understand her. When I went to leave, I opened Google Maps to show me the way home. Device said no connection. I remembered part of the way and figured when I was in range the phone would automatically connect. Well, I was only 1/2 hour from home and phone still gave 'no connection' message. Frustrated, I pulled over, shut the phone down and restarted it. Magically, it now had a connection!2 - Today it would not make a call (even 911!), all incoming calls went straight to voicemail and call history did not even show these calls. Restarted phone and magically, everything was ok!3 - Samsung music player in new phones does not play WMA files where the Samsung player in my old A51 would.I can't believe I spent this much money on a phone that I apparently need to restart every few days to get it to function properly and to restart it when I go out of range (I was only 1 county over).I may get iPhone next time or if an Android, definitely NOT Samsung.","September 3, 2024"
"SAMSUNG Galaxy A25 5G A Series Cell Phone, 128GB Unlocked Android Smartphone, AMOLED Display, Advanced Triple Camera System, Expandable Storage, Stereo Speakers, US Version, 2024, Black",BGK,4.0,"TL;DR: Nice phone with a few common-sense features, and several issues.I'm an undemanding user, and my old A01 showed its age at the end of its support life. It began lagging more and more. Storage was full and apps wouldn't update because there supposedly wasn't enough space, regardless of the size of SD card I installed. The very definition of ""planned obsolescence"". Wanting to avoid this with my next phone, I bought something with more storage and memory this time around.SCREEN:After 2 Galaxy A15's had phantom screen press issues I decided to give the A25 a try since online resources suggested it had a different screen. Thankfully I've yet to have any phantom screen press issues about 2 months since receipt.Per gsmarena.com the A15's features a 800-nit screen, while the A25 features a 1000-nit screen. The noticeable difference here is that the A25 is actually usable in sunlight. The A15 is too dim. This is very important, and I feel a huge drawback of the A15.BATTERY:I subjectively feel like the A25 runs down the battery a bit faster than the A15. This does make sense given the hardware. Per nanoreview.net the SOC of this phone is more powerful than that of the A15, with a lower battery life rating. Per gsmarena.com the A25 has a 120Hz screen vs. the 90Hz of the A15, while both phones feature 5000 mAh batteries.Either someone at Google decided to finally build battery charge thresholds into Android after 14 versions (better late than never?), or this phone, due to price point and/or hardware, supports them. This should help improve battery lifespan of this phone.Neither the A15 or A25 feature wireless charging. I don't care. You might.HARDWARE:I DO care that both feature 3.5mm jacks. They make life so much better. Locating it on the bottom, unlike the A01's top-mounted 3.5mm jack, makes it easier to route a cable when it's in a pocket or car mount.It supports either dual SIM or one SIM and a microSDXC. This also makes life much better. I wish it could hold 2 SIMs AND a microSDXC at once, but it's better than nothing I suppose.The cameras are pretty good, but get grainy/pixelated when zooming in. My camera needs are modest compared to some, so I'm satisfied.The notch for the front camera is fine. In fact I grew to like the status info (battery, WiFi/cellular, notification icons, etc) being at the top, next to the notch, in the A01, giving more room to apps.The inclusion of stereo loudspeakers is a nice upgrade from the A15, especially considering the price increase. If you hold the phone at an off-angle they can sound strange due to the angle. For best results hold the phone with the screen flat toward your face.It gets a bit warmer than the A15. A quick internet search suggests it's the Exynos SOC. Thumbs down.I'm not particularly tough on my phones, so the plastic construction is fine for me. I put it in a silicone case. This makes it easier to grab, and was potentially far less expensive than buying a phone with metal construction.SIZE:The phone's too big*. The A01 was too big at 5.7"", and the A25 is worse 6.5"". I have long fingers and it's impossible to reach the top of the screen (where one might find a close or menu button in an app) one-handed without major grip adjustment, risking dropping the phone. The A01 was borderline uncomfortable in the (large) pockets of my pants, the A15/A25 cross the border. Squatting down must be carefully done lest it dig into your hip and cause discomfort or pain. Yes viewing more of web pages is nice. Yes I have to thumb to the next page of ebooks less when there are more words on-screen. Yes, more screen real estate is nice for Google Maps. But I don't NEED those things. In fact, I'd rather have an easier-to-carry PHONE, not a PHABLET I have to buy military cargo pants or a purse to comfortably carry.SOFTWARE:Mostly stable and as-expected: minimal changes to Android and the usual Samsung bloatware. There are some issues but I'm not sure if I can blame Samsung.1. Expo Go (an app used for mobile app development) doesn't allow interaction with the app I'm helping develop. Expo Go itself works fine on both the A15 and A25, but the in-development app would appear frozen. The in-development app works perfectly on Expo Go on the A01.2. ** 2nd Edit: The issue has resurfaced, and I've had to switch to a different camera app. Edit: this issue appears to have been resolved, perhaps via one of the updates the phone received since I wrote about it. Original issue text: ""I set the ""side button"" (power button) to turn on the flashlight when double-pressed. Using the included camera app before using the side button to turn on the flashlight results in the flashlight not working. This can be fixed by clearing the camera app's cache every time you want to use the flashlight, or using a different camera app. For all I know there's a fix for these, but I haven't found it yet (and I've looked).""3. Some third-party apps fail to start and require a second screen tap.VALUE:This phone is exiting the budget segment toward mid-range, but you get more for your money compared to an entry-level phone. More computing power, more storage and memory, an ultrawide camera, stereo speakers, a better screen than the A15, while retaining a 3.5mm jack.*But ""the market"" wants big phones (see the Marques Brownlee video ""Small Phones are Dead and We Killed Them"" video for more).","May 11, 2024"

Read the negative reviews about the A25. Apparently, the shutting off/connection problems are a known issue and are non-repairable.Days after the 30-day return window closed, my son's phone kept turning off. Call Samsung customer service and the representative says it is because we aren't using the correct Samsung charger. Bought two of the recommended chargers and they are EXACTLY like the two we already own. What a waste of money!Continued to have phone issues. Contact Samsung customer service and they say to return it for repair. Next we get an email saying phone received by Samsung repair department but they don't have the needed part and it will take 10 days for them to get it.Update: (May 10, 2024), we get an email stating the phone is being returned -- UNREPAIRED. No explanation, just an 800 number to call for more info.  Called, complained, told they'd look into it. Called, complained, told it was being referred to another department.Update: (May 24, 2024) After weeks of complaining and being jerked around, we finally get a text that we'll get a cash refund. Heaven knows how long it will take to actually get it.We will replace the defective Samsung A25 with a different model. Meanwhile, we hold our breath and hope our second A25 lasts more than a few months.For years, we've been fans of Samsung products, having owned a number of Samsung televisions, monitors, tablets, phones. Samsung was our go-to for electronic entertainment. Normally, we love the products but the customer service is definitely third-rate at best. We hope the experience we had with the A25 is an isolated one and not a predictor of the way Samsung's business is heading.","May 10, 2024"

After owning the phone for a few months it began malfunctioning.  It would start and stop apps on its own randomly.  Sometimes it would start playing music, other times the weather or the calculator numerous other apps would start.  Today it was Lyft's turn, and it welcomed me as a new user.  At least I could make and receive phones and texts; everything else was a crap shoot.Samsung customer service was even worse.  The phone was past Amazon's 30 day return period, but I knew I was covered by Samsung's 1 year warranty... ha!!!  I've never been so wrong.  The first tech was a very pleasant woman to whom I gave permission to link into my phone and adjust some settings more to her liking.  She made sure I had the most up to date firmware (maybe software).  This did no good.  The next tech had me wipe the phone clean to original factory settings, and then download the current firmware.  This also did no good.  I finally got to a supervisor, and he said to take the phone to Samsung's nearest walk-in repair location.  Happily this was only a few miles from my home.  The tech there accomplished nothing.Today I went through the entire tech and then to supervisor routine again.  The supervisor promised to call me back in about 2 hours after texting me to make sure it was a convenient time.  He never texted nor called... what an insult to a customer.  So I tried again working my way to another supervisor, who had the ticket of my earlier call.  He insisted I sent them the phone to have their tech people examine it.  That this was done locally had no impact on him.  I raised enough hell to be bumped up to his boss who went on and on about Samsung's ""Policy"" of getting the phone back before honoring their warranty, and their was no other way.I give him a couple of other ways, such as buying a phone from Amazon and and sending it to me (as a loaner, if need be), or he could reach in his pocket and send me his phone to use while my phone in transit and being evaluated for a maybe 3-4 weeks.  He had a fit.  I gave him a few other options, but he said that only one of their techs had that authority.  I told him I'd guess the CEO of Samsung in Korea probably had that authority as well.  And that many other people had it as well, but he would only repeat Samsung's ""Policy"", which I then told him was in conflict with my Policy.I let him know that I'd contact the Ohio Sect of State, who loves tearing into big companies, and that I was sure his team of lawyers would find something, anything to sue them for.  I guess breach of contract, false advertising, etc.  When I told him government works slowly so he might not be served with the suit for a few years, but to be on the look out for it.Keep away from this phone, and never count on Samsung to honor their warranty.  They make it nearly impossible to dance to their requirements.","September 4, 2024"

I bought it because the android platform is much simpler and for years did not seem to have the problems of Apple downloading iOS that deliberately slow everything down.Not anymore. About two months after I had this phone a series of downloads were placed on Samsung. Now it takes about two minutes to boot up, so quick reboot.  Now put a bar on the screen, saying optimizing apps and takes a good full two minutes to reboot just to turn the thing on. I’m not talking about a reboot after updates. I’m talking about every time I turn on the phone. Quite a surprise to me. Samsung wanted to be like an iPhone, well, Apple may mess with battery obsolete all your accessories, etc. but at least it’s still boots up quickly.I can’t say that for this phone. It was functioning just fine if I’ve written this review a month earlier it would’ve been a 4 1/2 star.  Now, I don’t know what they’ve put on this phone.

I was upgrading from a middle-of-the-road Motorola.  The graphics on this Samsung were great, smooth motion, and really high brightness levels.  Sound was also really good.The bad.  Like, really bad.  After spending two days getting everything set up on the new phone, I'm using it for navigation, and the phone just shut off.  Restarted, ran, for another few minutes, and shut off again.  No, the battery wasn't dead.  After that, it would stay running long enough for me to log in, then shut off again.  No drops, bumps, impacts, or anything.Found a video online that showed a setting that could enable these random shut-downs, but that option was not set on my phone.The phone felt warm, but not uncomfortably hot.  After keeping it powered off for a couple hours, I was able to get it going again, and it stayed up, but now, no texts or calls came in, and anything I tried to send said ""waiting for network"".  Texts would eventually send, usually minutes later.I'm using the phone in the same area I've lived for decades, and there are no known network dead spots.  Every other phone I've had, with multiple carriers, works fine everywhere.  If I randomly open Chrome on the phone, it's unable to get online unless I'm somewhere with wifi.  The mobile data network would eventually reconnect, but for me, the phone was just too unreliable, so I'm returning it.Silver lining here is that the phone starting failing almost immediately, so I was still easily within Amazon's return window.","March 12, 2024"

The phone wouldn’t make or receive calls or texts, and the internet would work for a few minutes and then go dead for an extended period.The service carrier (T-Mobile) ran multiple diagnostics on the phone and told me the problem is likely the hardware. That’s when the chaos really started.I called Samsung, and they told me I need to call their local repair center.When I called the repair center, they told me they didn’t have parts for the phone, and it would likely take about 3 days to fix it because they would have to order the parts.So I called Samsung back to ask for a replacement phone, and they told me I needed to go the repair center to have them confirm that the phone is under warranty.So I wasted an hour driving to and from the repair center, only to have them tell me that the parts are backordered, and they don’t know when they are coming in.Soooo, I called Samsung again, and they told me that I needed to send my phone to them, and they will repair it or send me a new one in about 12 business days!I demanded a supervisor, and the supervisor told me there was nothing she could do to speed up this process.I told her that was outrageous and unacceptable, and she then called Amazon to ask for an extension of the return window. Kudos to Amazon for refunding the phone.Samsung then offered to sell me an A35 for $80 more than the A25, which I rejected.So here I am, about 10 hours of wasted time later, without a phone.","May 23, 2024"

After WEEKS of troubleshooting, including completely reseting the phones, we still had connection issues with ALL 3 phones. I'm talking Bluetooth, wifi & cell service connection issues. We were lucky to keep cell service at all, much less 5G. Sometimes I'd get the old busy dial tone when I'd call my husbands phone, even if it was showing I had good cell service. His would do the same when he'd call me, never seen that issue before... My 1st phone had a faulty battery & connection issues within a week or so. We returned it for another one, hoping for the best. Then my husband's phone started having the same connection issues. My new phone arrived & guess what? Same connection issues right off the bat. It's for sure not our sim cards/service provider because our old phones work just fine. Thank goodness we still have them. Our wifi isn't cutting in and out on any of our other devices. My bluetooth headphones work & connect just fine to other devices! These phones are just defective! This has been such a nightmare!!!! We're switching back to the S series & will be buying elsewhere. Not sure if it's Amazon selling all the defective ones or if its just the A25 model in general.","March 8, 2024"

The most important features for me are a definite downgrade with this. The cameras and wifi connection are a joke. Samsung added a bunch of useless features at the cost of a quality phone. It's bloated but none of that counts when you need it. Battery life is not great either. It seems like Samsung locks out features because it's midrange and not because the phone would be capable.

It is a little heavier but I don't mind. The battery is great but avoid auto brightness if you want to have better performance. It has everything I needed without being larger size and twice the price. I have a brand new laptop for doing anything fancier than what I want to do on the phone so could not find any value in getting the S24 or S24+. I don't use the stylus much anymore either. If there isn't something you absolutely must have in the S24 series, this is a very good deal for half the price.","June 29, 2024"

Maybe its me, but privacy is out the window with almost everything that is connected to the internet. And I really dislike the Google playstore, trick of install this app, but you need to then sign up for this app, and also anther app, before you can use the first app.The phone has lots of memory, performance is good, picture quality is excellent.

"SAMSUNG Galaxy S23 FE AI Phone, 256GB Unlocked Android Smartphone, Long Battery Life, Premium Processor, Tough Gorilla Glass Display, Hi-Res 50MP Camera, US Version, 2023, Graphite",PNWACE,5.0,"I got this phone on sale for $400 (Black Friday 2023). So far, it's been very good for the price. The chipset is simply blazing fast. Everything feels snappy on this phone. Opening and closing apps are quick. Animation is smooth and does not stutter. The build quality is amazing and feels good to touch. So good that I did not use case until I first dropped it (more on this later).One drawback this phone has is battery life. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor is power hungry. The battery, while theoretically big, is quickly depleted. I mostly use my phone for navigation (Android Auto wireless), YouTube video playback, browsing on Edge, or social media chatting. My Screen on Time (SoT) life is expected to be 7 hours when fully charged according to AccuBattery Pro app I installed since day one of owning this phone. That is my usage without gaming ever. Expect the battery life to go down to around 4 hours or even less if you game because gaming is extremely taxing on your phone. It also heats up quite quickly, probably because it's drawing a bit too much power than it should have (inefficient CPU / GPU). One solution I have working for me is by activating Light performance profile under Device Care settings. This decrease the performance unless you're gaming. For my use case, it's perfect because it doesn't overheat anymore. That 7 hours SoT figure is with this profile turned on. Expect it to be around 5.5 to 6 hours SoT without this on.So about me dropping the phone, it was when I was changing my car's tires. I was crouching, so when it fell, it was about 12 inches high. The floor was concrete, and it was not clean. This is the worst combination because dust and debris are really abrasive and can easily put lots of dents and scratches on phone. Surprisingly, other than two scratches (one big, and one small), there's really no other damage. I was using matte screen protector at that time, so when it ended up falling screen down, it did crack the screen protector, but the screen remains flawless to this day. I assumed it fell by its side frame (charging port side), then it fell face down. I did attach the photo so you can judge the amount of damage done by this accident.","February 8, 2024"

So far it's very good, though I keep having to get used to how much bigger and heavier it is than me old one. Love the color. Must faster processing than my old one and much bigger battery life, but again, that's not hard, haha. So far no issues. Big screen is much easier to read on. I'm still a bit thrown by how big all the app icons are and that you can't make them smaller to fit more on one page but that's whatever.","July 21, 2024"

(Bought 256gb version at $500 USD) I'm the type of guy who mostly uses this for calls/texts and light gaming. It can run games like CoD Mobile and Genshin Impact high settings pretty well but I'm not much of a mobile gamer so take that with a grain of salt. As for regular phone use it'll handle every task you throw at it. The thumbprint reader and facial recognition are both really fast and the phone feels pretty snappy compared to the old GalaxyA50 I used to have. Battery life is above average and I only charge the phone once a day. The phone seems to only heat up during long heavy gaming and generally stays cool.Other things to keep in mind:You can still get insurance for this phone like I did through the official Samsung care plan website. I also attached a magsafe case on the phone to make use of magnetic accessories. This way you can wirelessly charge with magnetic chargers and phone stands (very useful for car charging). Also allows me to get magnetic phone rings to hold up my phone without having to use adhesive on my phone case.,"June 5, 2024"

I just switched back to android after years of being with Apple I got tired of my phone being outdated so quickly and the lack of user customization. I was looking at this phone for a bit because I wanted a galaxy and in the past my old androids when I was young would slow down and lag after a week of use. I haven't had this one for even a week yet but it's clearing all my worries thus far. My first worry was will it really be ""unlocked"" or will I have to go through a series of emails and returns to get one that accepts my Sim. Nope, popped my Sim in from my iPhone xr (I use cricket) it prompted me to restart the device so it could configure to it and boom. It even auto went to 5g shortly after (xr doesn't support 5g). There's that, I was also worried it would lag or skip like the cheaper androids I assume I had when I was younger but, man, this thing is smooth! I did a bit of extensive research and I was debating between this and a used s23 at the same price but after much debate and the risks of buying a used phone no matter who the seller is I landed back here and I don't regret it. All the good features as the flagships and none of the useless ones at half the price. Battery seems great thus far, just know that with every phone if you treat the battery with no care it will degrade so do a little research. Condition was amazing. Came packed in a loose box kind of but the phones packaging itself that was inside the box won't let anything happen to it. My only tip is buy a case when you buy the phone, it's very smooth and nice but also slippery and will fall out your pocket very easily between motions so keep that in mind. Hope I helped!

For me personally this phone was a necessary upgrade because lots of apps would no longer work on my s8. If that never happened I would never have ""upgraded"" First of all the fingerprint reader is absolute garbage in comparison to the s8. This one barely works half the time when the s8 would work EVERY SINGLE TIME. Having the power button and the volume buttons on the same side of the phone is also stupid. It was super easy to take screen shots before when the volume was on the other side, now it is just uncomfortable. Also there being no way to actually know if I got a notification is stupid. There is no blinking light like on the s8. The only way to see is with the always on screen that is impossible to see from across the room. Another downgrade is the fact that I can not make the different notifications vibrate different ways. On the s8 I had text messages the long vibrate and notifications the two short buzz. Now its all mixed up in the same way with either changing call vibrate or notifications. Nothing to tell a text from a normal notification. I just don't understand way there were so many downgrades over the years in favor of a better camera and storage. So many of these changes are just to make the user experience worse.","May 26, 2024"

Sjoman,3.0,"I have always had android phones and my work gave me some money to buy a new phone for myself. I decided to splurge a little and got this one because I had heard good things. I bought it on Amazon because it was $50 cheaper than at the Verizon store. I think I made a huge mistake. Everyone I know that likes this phone bought it through Verizon.  I WOULD NOT BUY through Amazon. It regularly will tell me I'm disconnected from my phone service, so calls and texts won't go through. The Bixby voice command thing will randomly say, ""I didn't understand"", even when my phone is locked. The battery life is okay. I had the moto g power before and there was no comparison.  The moto g power definitely lasted longer. I would say this phone is fine if you don't need ot to do very much. I will say I rely heavily on my phone for work, and it is a bit slow.","July 4, 2024"

Changed from 3 stars to an 5 star.Ordered this new phone as hubster's replacement phone.  We had been searching for a while for just the right one, has great reviews and a fantastic price. We received the original order quickly, charged it and started the set up. The phone needed a PIN to log in and set up. We thought this was unusual for a new phone. Started a chat session w/Amazon Help Desk and w/in 5 minutes was told that it appeared to have been used by a customer, returned the item and we ended up receiving it in error.  We were offered the return option so that we could purchase another one. We initiated the return process and mailed it out the next day.  The return message on my Amazon account stated that we would be refunded when they received the device. I have been monitoring my emails and still have not received any notice or tracking info.  I checked the tracking number thru UPS and it shows that the device was received 2 days ago.  I logged into my Amazon account and the Refund Status shows the same info but I am not scheduled for my $500+ refund until more than 2 weeks away. Why would it take that long and why would they indicate that my refund would be issued upon their receipt? Very frustrating!

Picture quality is awesome.Be warned, it does not have a headphone jack. Wish it did so that I could connect it to radios which do not have Bluetooth.Also, could not get the provider I wanted because their system did not have this on approved list yet. Had to choose another provider (Visible by Verizon.) ATT & Verizon recognized it with no issues. But, Spectrum did not (that's the one I wanted), neither did Metro PCS (T-Mobile), which both companies did sell the exact phone at a higher price, weird.Definitely faster than my old Moto G Stylus (2020), I can browse much easier and faster. And, the apps load up faster. I just think it's a bit too expensive for what it is.I maybe expecting too much, but battery life seems wanting. I really didn't put it to a formal test, but during the first days of setting up the phone I had to charge it a lot. Even now, I have to charge it once a day, and I mainly use it for using the apps to do minimal work. So, take my rating on battery life with a grain of a salt.","January 3, 2024"

It's a great phone, especially if you're looking for an affordable upgrade. Feels premium and not too costly to obtain. The cameras & battery life are great. What I like most is that its not ""curved"" but actually square with smooth edges- its easy to hold and grip. It's easy to interact with, up to date, transferring everything is simple. Very similar in size to a S22+, the weight may seem heavy to some. I appreciate how this was made. The only con is it comes with a USB-C to USB-C cable, meaning you have to buy a USB-C charger cube/box if you don't already have one since it's a USB-C type of charger. If you're used to the older charger types you can easily find a cable that connects to the charger cube/box but has a USB-C end on the other end of the charger.","November 29, 2023"

I did purchase the 25 watt charger, so that was an extra 15 bucks. Others that say the battery life is bad are probably wrong, mine is great. I live in a poor cell reception area, so I have wifi calling enabled. Assuming that is also their problem, when you have poor signal, it will drain your battery because it is working harder searching for signal constantly. My area is bad for all carriers. I have T-mobile prepaid which is better than anything else in my area. Easy switch, transfer files and just insert old phone sim card into new phone and restart. This was a replacement for a 5yr old  a20 that I recently dropped and broke the screen. No complaints and have had it for about a month now. Fast USA model. Shipped and sold by Amazon. Also grabbed a Ringke Onyx case which is pretty good, very tight and military grade drop protection. This thing is waterproof also up to 30 minutes submerged in 4 ft of water..go see for yourself on Youtube.

I turned off WIFI and got a cell connection and in the upper banner it only said 4G. I even went grocery shopping a few miles away (read different tower) and it was also only 4G. My 6 year old LG v35 picks it up no issue. The model I received was a SM-S711UI . . I guess AT&T is only compatible with a SM-S711U.

Smith,4.0,"I bought this on Black Friday for $400 and at that price the S23 FE is definitely worth it. The Snapdragon processor can definitely keep up with the adaptive refresh rate up to 120 Hz. This phone can handle most games you throw at it without a noticeable drop in FPS. The camera is sharper compared to Samsung's A series line. The smaller battery is noticeable here so expect to charge your phone more often but it does support 25W fast charging. This phone does get warm after prolong and extensive use but I use a phone case so it doesn't bother me. There is no headphone jack, no charging block included, or expandable storage which stops it from being 5 stars. Overall though, this is a great budget phone if you don't want to pay flagship prices but still get 80% of the features of a flagship phone.","November 29, 2023"

I've searched online, and other people have the same issue. It is apparently due to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen1 (SM8450) being terrible for battery life. Even the normal Samsung Galaxy S23 phones (which were released before the Galaxy S23 FE) use the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen2 (SM8550), which is insanely better. Why they didn't decide to use it on this phone (which is newer) is beyond me. It was a terrible mistake on Samsung's part, in my opinion. There's no excuse for using a 2-year-old processor from your S22 lineup for a phone that was just released. Having a 4500mAh battery means nothing when the power-hungry CPU is sucking the life out of it. The battery of my 8-year-old Samsung Galaxy S9 is comparable to this phone, which is new out of the box and fully charged with dark mode and a dim screen. You are better off buying a phone with a processor that doesn't suck the battery life out of it like a vampire. Cheaping out and having such poor battery life is unacceptable in 2024.Updated: 7 months later and the battery is still atrocious. I honestly just wish I bought the S23+, S23 Ultra or the S24 phones. This phone is junk. I took a star off because the battery is dying even faster now.","August 10, 2024"

It took some time using the smart swith app for Android as I had thousands of photos but was all done in the app. It's much faster than the S9 but the easy to use of the android system. It is totally unlocked as advertised and connected to the Verizon network right away. FYI: get a new sim card rather than using your old phones existing sim card. The only issue I ran into was by using my S9 sim card it was registered to the old phone and discovered it was in the new S23fe which it didn't like. It stopped communicating with verizon. The techs at verizon fixed everything quickly and it now works perfectly all at no charge! The camera portion of the phone takes ok selfies and basic photographs. The zoom feature came out a little blurry. Not the best camera setup but the phone/texting and all apps function as desired.

So if this is a feature you use often, you will want to go through verizon not Amazon. Super annoying. My husband's unlocked Google Pixel has it, I probably should have gone with that.","May 1, 2024"

From the moment I started using this device, it was clear that Samsung has truly outdone itself with this model. The 256GB of storage is more than ample for all my apps, photos, and videos, and the performance is lightning fast thanks to the latest AI technology and powerful processing.The display is simply stunning—vivid colors, sharp details, and deep blacks make everything from streaming videos to scrolling through social media a visually immersive experience. The build quality is top-notch, and the design is sleek and premium, giving it a luxurious feel in the hand.One of the standout features for me is the advanced camera system. The images are incredibly detailed, even in low-light conditions, and the array of shooting modes allows for creative flexibility. The battery life is impressive as well, easily lasting through a full day of heavy use without a hitch.Being unlocked and Android-based means I have full control over my device and can switch carriers or customize settings without hassle. The software experience is smooth, with Samsung’s enhancements adding value without overwhelming the core Android experience.Overall, the SAMSUNG Galaxy S24 Ultra is a fantastic investment for anyone looking for a high-performance, feature-packed smartphone. It’s reliable, powerful, and offers an exceptional user experience. Highly recommended!","August 15, 2024"
"SAMSUNG Galaxy S24 Ultra Cell Phone, 512GB AI Smartphone, Unlocked Android, 200MP, 100x Zoom Cameras, Long Battery Life, S Pen, US Version, 2024, Titanium Black",ideal deals,5.0,"PLEEEEEASE people, stop complaining about the display and things like that, the display is just AMAZING!!By looking at the low rating of the item, I was really impatient to recieve my device and finally write the review about it. I pre-ordered the S24 Ultra in Violet color, 512Gb version, and want to note that everything was fair as expected - I got the 512Gb version at the price of 256Gb one, and also 200$ Amazon Gift, which is a non-redeemable gift that works as a single time -200$ to your purchases FROM AMAZON, that you can use within approximately 5 or 6 months.Next about the device - it's really beautiful! I really love everything about it, the size, the flat screen, the back cover and cameras - design-wise this is a beauty.It has lot's of nice and fun features to play with, it's my second day of usage and I still have AI features to test, camera capabilities to check out, etc. And the S Pen - this is my first ever Samsung phone, and I really got used to it, and to be honest - it's sometimes a lot more comfortable to use the S Pen instead of your fingers. Some things in life are really designed to be accomplished with a pen and paper, this phone covers that need!The sound and speakers are veeery loud, I mean my whole office can hear my incoming notifications lol, and the quality of music listening, video watching, etc. - really nice.I still have to find out all of the capabilities of the camera, this is a separate big topic, but so far I can confirm what lot's of reviewers have already talked about - the normal photo taking is great, selfies look really amazing for a front camera, the zoom is fantastic with really good details, night mode results in bright as day photos (although a bit noisy) and video shooting is also nice with different mods.The OS is very nice and really sophisticated to say the least, I mean you can connect the device to a monitor, mouse and keyboard via some 5-in-1 Anker for example, and here you just got yourself a laptop with the size of a phone. OneUI is really the most rich software I've used so far, and before using it I was skeptical if I'd like it or not, but I'm really getting used to it, and the features like multitasking in a true desktop way on the phone - this is something else (not the Dex, just phone multi window usage, that's AWESOME).The battery is nice, maybe I expected something more by viewing some reviews with almost 20 hours of screen time or so, but really it's fine for a day of usage with QHD resolution, adaptive brightness, and app and AI usage during the whole day.The only disadvantages I want to mention are the price tag that is high (let's be honest) and the box contents, I mean why copy bad stuff from Apple and not include at least a small charging brick in the box? This is really uncool, especially within that price.I started with the display, but want to finish talking about it as well, it's HUGE, and I really like it, the corners are sharp-ended, but that gives you the advantage of viewing a non-cropped-out content, the resolution, the brightness, refresh rate... The display is a killer really, I really don't get the people that complain about the color, or perform some tests on the device, etc.... no need.Overall I'm really happy with my purchase, this is a great phone I can recommend to any software and hardware enthusiasts like me, and maybe to iPhone users as well, to come out of the box and see that there are other great phones out there in the world that can totally kill any iPhone with all the features and stuff you get.","February 15, 2024"

I haven't been this happy with a smartphone in years, it's incredible. It's a beast though, know that. It's big and unless you fiddle with the settings, not a one handed phone for most.

Brown,3.0,"I have waited awhile before i reviewed this product it is great for day-to-day use. At a minimum it takes great pictures and video. The screen is a great size for people with average to large hands. At first glance it looks like a standard ultra model its big, orbital lens separation, sturdy, bezel with a sleek design. I have been a Samsung fan since the galaxy line up started and practically owned every model out there to test and see which one is practical me the average joe. If you a minimalist this might not be the phone for you. This has the latest tech and probably will be overwhelming for you. This is due to the endless features that it has. If you are a gamer and have several hrs to kill on your favorite Mobile game this will meet your needs and then some. If you are that person that has been a Samsung note fan than this is the phone for you. If you're a movie junkie this will def suit your needs, when you're on a break from work or just hanging out. The color details are great especially in 4k. With this being said there are some quirks that i did not know existed and will pass it on to everyone. The s24 ultra has some drawbacks if you are purchasing it directly through Samsung. Your video calling will not work on with carriers - the reason for this Samsung does not have to voip it's a software according to Samsung. This is when you go to your contacts, and you have the option for video calling. This apparently cannot be put on by your carrier as they will deny trying to add it.(Samsung blamed the carrier , the carrier blamed Samsung) After several back-and-forth conversations Samsung told me to download a 3rd party app to allow me to video call. Other providers told me they could not help me. Now would you want to tell all of your contacts to download a 3rd party app and you would have to ask yourself ""would you do it for one person?"". Moving on to text messages and multimedia. You would normally be able pictures direct to people where it would show on the receiver's messages. But instead, it will send them a link that would expire in a certain time frame. They will then have to click to download the image to their phone. My question would be, how annoying that has to be every time i send someone a picture. They have to go through a ring of fire just to see the image or video. I have also asked about this with carriers they have stated, you guessed it go with a third-party app.  to the upside the phone is great. Standard android system as they have always been great but with a lot more at your disposal. Gpu is exceptionally fast (doesn't feel laggy or buggy) Camera is outstanding have taken countless photos with it. Videos are not grainy as some cameras from the galaxy line up once were. The phone is unlocked from Samsung. Bluetooth is great, connects fast and easy. Graphics are great for this model (does not overheat like the previous models when gaming) Overall if you want a phone that does the job this can do it. But do not purchase it directly from Samsung, purchase it through your carrier to avoid the hassles and dragged-out conversations i have gone through. I hope this helps you make your decision a little bit clearer on how you want to proceed on a new phone. I am giving it 3 stars from the manufacture. There was no recourse rectifying a solution. Also, for placing blame on another company and have me contact them, rather than Samsung trying to speak to the carrier direct that it also provides phones to.","July 18, 2024"
"SAMSUNG Galaxy S24 Ultra Cell Phone, 512GB AI Smartphone, Unlocked Android, 200MP, 100x Zoom Cameras, Long Battery Life, S Pen, US Version, 2024, Titanium Black",The Detroit Scanner,5.0,"The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, with its impressive 512GB storage capacity, sets a high bar in the smartphone market, offering a blend of cutting-edge technology, sleek design, and robust performance. Here’s a detailed review of this flagship device:### Design and BuildThe Galaxy S24 Ultra features a premium design with a sleek glass front and back, complemented by a sturdy metal frame. Its large, edge-to-edge display is visually stunning, providing an immersive viewing experience. The phone feels solid and well-balanced in hand, though its size might be unwieldy for users with smaller hands.### DisplaySamsung has long been known for its exceptional displays, and the Galaxy S24 Ultra is no exception. The 6.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED screen offers vibrant colors, deep blacks, and excellent brightness levels, making it perfect for everything from streaming videos to gaming. The 120Hz refresh rate ensures smooth scrolling and responsiveness, enhancing the overall user experience.### PerformanceUnder the hood, the Galaxy S24 Ultra is powered by the latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor (or Exynos equivalent in some regions), coupled with a generous 12GB of RAM. This combination ensures that the phone can handle intensive tasks, multitasking, and high-end gaming with ease. The 512GB of internal storage provides ample space for apps, media, and files, making it ideal for power users.### CameraOne of the standout features of the S24 Ultra is its camera system. The quad-camera setup includes a 200MP main sensor, ultra-wide, telephoto, and periscope lenses. The camera delivers exceptional photo and video quality, with sharp details, accurate colors, and impressive low-light performance. The zoom capabilities, up to 100x, allow for capturing distant subjects with surprising clarity.### Battery LifeThe phone boasts a 5000mAh battery, which comfortably lasts a full day of heavy usage. The inclusion of fast charging, both wired and wireless, means you can quickly top up the battery when needed. Additionally, the S24 Ultra supports reverse wireless charging, allowing you to charge other devices on the go.### SoftwareRunning on Samsung’s One UI over Android 14, the Galaxy S24 Ultra provides a smooth and intuitive user interface. Samsung’s software suite offers plenty of customization options and useful features, although some users might find the pre-installed apps and bloatware unnecessary.### Connectivity and ExtrasThe S24 Ultra supports 5G connectivity, ensuring fast data speeds and future-proofing your device. It also includes other high-end features like an under-display fingerprint scanner, facial recognition, and IP68 water and dust resistance. The lack of a headphone jack might be a downside for some, but it’s a common trend in modern smartphones.### PriceAs a flagship device, the Galaxy S24 Ultra comes with a premium price tag. The 512GB model, in particular, is an investment, but it justifies the cost with its high-end specifications and features. It’s an excellent choice for those who demand the best in performance, camera quality, and storage capacity.### ConclusionThe Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra 512GB is a powerhouse smartphone that excels in nearly every aspect. From its stunning display and powerful performance to its versatile camera system and ample storage, it’s designed to meet the needs of demanding users. While the price is high and the size may not suit everyone, it stands out as one of the best smartphones available in 2024.","July 24, 2024"

I really like having the pen which is the main reason I got it.  It has  a cool feature that I use quite a bit where you can hold down the home button and it will analyze whatever is on the screen or whatever you are pointing your camera at and then show you web results.  Or you can circle something on the screen and it will search for that.  Or it will translate text on the screen which can be really useful.  I am particular about how my home screen looks so I really like the feature that can generate an ai picture and use the color palette from the picture to use for the phone theme colors and it can also automatically redo those gawdy standard android icons to ones that look nice with the current wallpaper.  I like the new messages app that works better with those pesky iphone users :). The camera is of course awesome as well as the zoom.  Speakers sound better than my old phone and the battery life is better too.What I dislike most is the sharp corners, they are uncomfortable even with a phone case on.  Also the weight is only about 1/2 ounce more than my old phone but it is noticeable.  If those issues were fixed then it would be a five star phone.","August 26, 2024"

The Samsung switch app made porting all my apps and emails messages calls and everything else from my old phone to this one a breeze just downloaded the app on my old phone connected them both to the same wifi network and clicked begin and it did the rest. As far as connecting it to my carrier (metro by T-mobile) all I had to do was contact customer care and register this phones IMEI number with them and then I was able to remove my Sim card from my old phone and put it in this one and that was it now I have a Samsung galaxy s24 ultra on the metro network.,"July 25, 2024"

So this is old hat, you either love this phone for its S Pen or just go with something else. I use my phone and the pen to make grocery lists, to do lists, draw, edit photos, etc.Pros:-FLAT SCREEN IS BACK. HOLY COW, how I've hated those stupid curved edges, glad that flat is back. Just bring back MicroSD expansion as well. I would say bring back headphones but apparently Android 10 or later killed external mic support via the combo jack. So, that's useless. This was the MAJOR reason why I upgraded my S23 Ultra, no joke, now I can put actual screen protectors on it, don't have to worry about optical glue-on glass that you then cure with UV.Cons:-Love that you can't turn off really annoying unnecessary notifications like the DAILYWELLNESS nonsense, weekly usage reports, ""hey we turned these apps off since you're not using them"".-Love that the galaxy store now has push notification ads that you can't turn off in settings or in app. That's super cool. Save that crap for your GALAXY A lines that are budget oriented, not your professional S lines.-New S Pen, now most of the time, the S-Pens that come with these are SERVICEABLE at best, but for whatever reason, this year's is painful to use, could be old age kicking in at 36 or just a bad design. It's too thin and too square. Last year's was slightly wider. NEVER MIND, just compared them, they're basically the same, it's the fact that last years had a rubberized texture on it, where this year's is just plastic, that's why it hurts to use.Meh:-A lot of this is more the same incremental improvements; cpu is beefier, display is brighter and more betterer, s pen is faster, touch is faster, etc. THE BORING STUFF.Overall:You always take a gamble with Amazon's ""USED"" stuff, and was worried that I was going to get a bad one. I bought, USED VERY GOOD, which usually means cosmetic damage somewhere on the device, and then it was ""USED VERY GOOD, potentially without box"". Mine looked pristine, slapped a screen protector and case on it right away to keep it that way, and it came with a box. You buy this phone if Samsung and styluses are your jam. OTHERWISE there's no real reason to get this. When there are a lot of companies with the 8 Gen 3 out there for a lot cheaper and in smaller more manageable body sizes. Like the S23 Plus or S23 standard. The Titanium Gray color has a slight champagne/earthen quality to the gray that I kind of dig that's subtle and sort of classy.","April 9, 2024"

Comes in the original box, with all the accessories (charging cord, SIM tray pick and paper manual), but was slightly sloppily taped together in place of the original tear-away seals. Phone was missing the plastic removeable screen protector, as expected, and was instead placed in a plastic bag (though, not an ESD bag).Physically the phone showed up in basically perfect condition. No blemishes on the screen, back or edges. The only thing I found was a slight scratch on the silver ring of the outside of the top rear camera.

Very disappointed.,5.0,"It's a good phone for the most part...some apps have been changed from my old phone...Note9...I really like the old apps better. The clock was better before...the way to set alarms, the alarm music choices. The stylus is still there, which is great because I use it a lot. I would have like to have a slot for an SD card included, and also an aux port to use wired headphones, etc..I do like the flat screen vs the rounded edge one of the Note9...easier to scroll flat. The speakers are OK, but sound a bit tinny compared to the Note9. It's a little heavy for one-handed use. The Bluetooth is wonky...does not stay connected to devices...consistently and repeatedly connects and disconnects...and reconnects and disconnects...over and over and over again.I'm getting used to it's quirks...was almost ready to return it. A phone that costs over $1k should not act up like this. Also, putting all of the buttons on one side of the phone is silly. To screenshot something, you had better control with one of the buttons on the opposite side of the phone. All on one side is awkward at best to operate.","June 26, 2024"

The only problem i've found is a little discoloration around the phone ports with just normal usr. The discoloration is not permanent, if you wipe it with a cloth it goes away and ut becomes as new. It's just annoying to have some parts of the frame get discolored with just normal and light use.Battery life with light performance mode is more than 24h, face unlock is a little hit and miss but fingerprint is perfect and fast, i used it for a month without any kind of protection and it didn't scratch.

There is a slot for a SIM card (although not required to use cell phone) it made set-up so easy for me. I installed my Cricket SIM card, got it connected the network & WiFi and got it going.  The phone eventually prompted me (asked me)  to switch over the to internal eSIM card which would give me greater functionality and I said yes.  Set-up completed.  I'm definitely enjoying my phone and my daughter loves the stylist.  Also Samsung's costumers service was amazing....during the initial set-up I forgot my Samsung account password - with one phone call and in less than 3 mins  a customer service agent talked me through a simple work around.

The screen color issue has been improved with a recent update (3/7/24)Hopefully all of the bad can be fixed with a software update but currently the phone is borderline unusable due to the extremely blue camera(s) white balance and lacking signal strength. I cannot understand how after ALL THIS TIME, Samsung seemingly doesn't test their flagship phone before manufacturing and shipping.As for the cameras, they're okay if the white balance wasn't green/blue and dark. My Note 20 from 3yrs ago takes nicer looking pictures but it's honestly difficult to tell if the cameras are any good because it's just so green/blue. If you edit each image one by one on an appropriate editor (not the built in one), you can get the images to look pretty good but a typical iphone 15 takes the same looking image without any editing. Reviewers are showing carefully shot images of scenes. General picture taking without much thought results in pretty bland/poor looking images you don't care to share. I really wish they would allow you to adjust at least the white balance settings in the camera app such that the images it takes are correct to what you desire by default.I don't know what to say about all the tech reviewers out there raving about this phone. Either they were given a completely different phone or they're all paid off. I wouldn't recommend this phone to anyone until Samsung addresses the ridiculous issues. I do believe all but the signal issue can be fixed with an update but that would require Samsung to admit there's an issue and then address it which seems to be difficult for them to do. The signal issue may even be able to be improved with a radio update but again, Samsung needs to admit there's something wrong which they don't want to.I absolutely hate Apple due to their requirement for you to live in their ecosystem but this will likely be my last Android if Samsung or someone else can't get their act together on such an expensive product.On a very very positive note, the antireflective screen on this phone is genuinely incredible. It's the single biggest upgrade imaginable. Unfortunately putting any screen protector ruins that feature so I'm just going to use it without a screen protector. The phone is worth buying simply for the antireflection. It's THAT BIG of a difference. I cannot understand why this isn't getting more attention. The darn signal strength issue is the single biggest deal breaker and so unfortunate and annoying. It's about ~15% worse than my 3yr old Note 20.","February 3, 2024"

If you have any kind of noise around you you will not build to hear it. It can play media very loud And usually have to turn it down a little.

I've had the S3, S4, S10, S20, and recently dropped the screen on my S21.  I've been a Samsung loyalist mainly because it's the best Android option, not for any other reason.  That being said, it's time for a change.I wanted to segregate the apps from my old phone and what would become my new phone, so I tried manually transferring data and the only apps I wanted on the new phone.  I planned to use my old phone for GP App use, so less apps would have direct access to my primary cell phone (I'd use mobile hotspot as needed).  It didn't go smooth, maybe it was my impatience, but there was an awful amount of bloatware and AI non-sense that no one needs.  I tried uninstalling what I could and got only so far.  Then I just gave up and used the Samsung app to drag everything from the old phone to the new phone.  It was OK but bloatware reappeared.  I wasn't happy because it neither adopted all of my prior phones settings, and neither all of my new phones settings...just an odd combo of each.My main grievance was that the battery drained so fast WITH NO USE.  After buying this phone, I still used my prior phone mostly at home and my laptop as well.  I rarely used the new phone for anything.  The battery simply drained dramatically for no reason.  I checked what apps were the cause and 1.  didn't list any apps used other than what I actually did use 2.  I think Windows Defender or whatever the Samsung equivalent is, was the primary source?  But even then, the % was so low.  But why go from 100% charge to 75% overnight, while I'm sleeping?  No thanks.  I gave it 2 weeks and this didn't change.  I thought some smartypants AI non-sense would adjust it, like I read somewhere but no dice.Also, somehow this phone/software kept backing up data I did NOT want backed up and in any cloud.  With the primary competitor to this phone the Pixel, a Google phone, I'm not sure what Android options remain.  I'm leaning towards a Tablet I can carry around and connect via Mobile Hotspot for apps and other uses.I also had mediocre data and cell reception quality.  It might have been the protector/case it was in, because I've had many Galaxy phones since the S3 with no problems in that department.","August 26, 2024"

Since then I have had waves of negative experiences with the software on the phone, and today capped it off with something that defies logic.When first setting the phone up, I was informed my PIN was too weak, and now needed to be 8 digits long. Alright, a bit weird but I can handle it. Then it maxed out at 3 fingerprints instead of my previous phone's 5, which has caused me minor grief because I've found that the fingers I chose to forego, index and thumb on my left hand, I actually used a fair bit more than I realized.Next up was the One+ UI, a disaster of an interface that took me hours to figure out how to bypass in favor of my typical layout. This comes packaged with an obscene amount of bloatware, and there's a hardware-based warranty void if you attempt to root to remove any of those apps, which I will never use and only take up space on the device. Fine, whatever, I'll adapt.Then it decided it wasn't going to connect to my PC with a transfer protocol, choosing only to charge itself from the connection. This was the first major issue with the phone, as I frequently moved files between my PC and previous phone and now am unable to do so directly, making file management a pain. There was one option I had left to work around this, a thumb drive with USB-A on one side and USB-C on the other, so I could connect it to my PC, drop desired files onto it, then connect it to the phone and offload them. A pain, but a workaround for the time being.And then it decided it didn't want to do mobile data after disconnecting from a Wi-Fi signal, requiring a full reboot to register that, yes, I do in fact pay a significant amount extra on my mobile plan for unlimited data and it should be using that. This would reproduce every time I disconnected from a Wi-Fi signal, until finally I opened the developer options and forced it to keep mobile data on even when on Wi-Fi.And then today I noticed the thing that finally bothered me enough to say something. I was transferring an album to the phone and happened to check the notifications pane, and it said it was charging the connected USB device. Let me repeat that: it was CHARGING A FLASH DRIVE. The drive was concerningly warm, and there was no way to disable it as the USB settings were apparently controlled by said flash drive. I checked online for any sort of solution or workaround, and found that this has apparently been the case since at least 2017 and Samsung has done nothing about it. This absurd misunderstanding of basic hardware is so far beyond what any QA should have caught, and if it's been part and parcel of Samsung devices for SEVEN YEARS then I'm done with Samsung's ecosystem. Y'all can keep your bloatware and atrocious programming; see how many customers it wins you.Editing this review on account of new developments; I now have grounds to take off the last pity star I was willing to give. The phone has started refusing to recognize its mobile data as an option every time it connects to Wi-Fi. I went so far as to order a new SIM card to see if that was the issue, but the symptoms have started to recognize on the new card as well. Given that I use this phone for work on the go, this is absolutely unacceptable. One star, fix your useless OS.","February 3, 2024"

Cons: facial recognition does not seem to work well. However, this is a priority C feature for me so in my case, no big deal. Pros: screen size is perfect for me, this is as big as a phone should be in my opinion; tough, dropped multiple times with no issues; bright screen legible in sunlight; good processor, runs apps fast - I play call of duty very well on this; 5g works great, very smooth video; charges fast, use usbc on AC adapter, charges swiftly; last but not least battery life is incredible even when under great use....estimate it at about 36 hours.

The new phone is slightly larger and heavier, but I do like the bigger display which features sharp resolution and vivid colors. I bought an unlocked phone and transferred my Mint Mobile sim card.

However, if you talk, text, use the web, and access apps like Google Maps, Facebook, Twitter, etc., then this phone will do nicely. As others have pointed out, a USB-C cable comes with the phone but no charger. I chatted with Samsung support, which recommended the 15W charger. I bought it on Amazon for under $16.00: Samsung 15W Wall Charger Type C (USB-C Cable Included), Black.

I like the the fingerprint reader so I can unlock the phone without having to type in a code in a crowded environment. Though it does take a bit for the phone to recognize my fingerprint.Since this was a new phone, I expected the battery life to last at least a couple of days before needing a recharge. Just like I had on previous phones. right of the bat, I barely got one day out of the battery. And it was creeping down from there.About 6 months later, I dropped the phone (And it was also in a ballistic shell) on one of tactile plastic mats so blind people can detect curb transitions from sidewalks to streets or the boundary from a train station platform to the tracks. The display almost popped out and the power switch actually turn 90 degrees in the shell. The fingerprint reader no longer worked and it was an effort to tun the phone on or off. I ended up having to use a pen point. Then that stopped working. In order to wake the phone up, I had to plug it into a charger or headphones.  I thought the failure of the power switch was a flukeI bought another A14, set it up, checked the battery charge,  transferred the apps, data and the SIM and SD cards. I was in the last stage of the configuration, pulling it out of sleep mode to enroll in the fingerprint reader and do a few final configuration tweaks. And the power switch failed. Pretty much like its predecessor without it being dropped. I attempted multiple times to wake it up without success.For me that tripped it over to being a piece of crap. I was not happy with having to buy another A14. I found the A15. It has a better rating, less expensive, more storage, RAM and better camera. So far so good but have  only had it operational for a little more than 12 hours. But it's already looking the battery life is much better.","May 22, 2024"

What an uprade and a fraction of the cost of the i phones ( which was #1 for photo) plus I believe its new not refurb. Super user friendly editing features. Rarely have to use my professional photo editor and better adjusting for various lighting. As far as other features seamless transition from my last Android. Not tecky but was able to figure out most everything on my own. Simple interface without clutter. Very well organized basic apps. No obnoxious intrusive Google apps. Easy to turn off those. Came with a cord but no box to plug into wall but that was no problem because had cords from last Droid. (C) Was a little finicky with which cords it would charge with ( the low quality ones didn't charge so tossed them) Unlocked. I switched to at & t. They were able to transfer # and contacts.

But they have horrible tech support and the phones are ONLY updated for two years.  NOT from date bought but date released which means many are out of date as far as updates go, again they and most other Android makers only update phones for two years if that..  I was going to buy a apple but I do not like all the limitations for them.Well I started deep research and found out that Samsung is the only company doing security updates for 5 years.  And on the models that have the KNOX security it is almost as good as it gets without being rip off by Apple's over price products.I first bought the A54 3 months ago for $400.00 and I believe it is one of the best phones for the money and it has the Knox well my wife needed a new phone and I bought the Samsung A14  for $199 it is excellent no it lacks the Knox security but is covered for 5 years of updates.  The only downside to the A14 is the finger print reader is in the on/off button.  That is a draw back unlike the A54 that it pops up on the front very easy to use.  Unlike the A14.

No general issues with hardware.The focus of this review is the inability to turn off noise reduction in the Samsung camera app, which seems like the only way to access the full 50 MP camera when you don't want pixel-binning. You end up with many photos (at all resolutions) looking like smoothed oil paintings.Non-Samsung apps like Open Camera can turn off NR, but only at the lower resolution it allows.

Large screen, fast, great camera; and while only 64G internal storage, for $10, I added a 128G sim for added storage. I was able to easily have the phone copy and load all my apps, photos, and data from my Moto 6G, using the Samsung Smart Switch app. I especially like the fingerprint reader being on the power button, allowing me to easily one-handed turn on the phone and unlock it.

This was the best priced phone that was 5G and had at least  the same features as my old phone. While this is a 2023 and my old phone was 2019 there isn't a lot of new features. I'd say mostly there are upgrades in screen quality, camera quality, storage capacity,  network, and some minor added features like it can link to your smart devices with an app, but I use Alexa on my fire tablet for that.

But the screen on this A14 5G is HORRIBLE, I mean it is like the screen from an old cheap Kindle Fire tablet is what it reminds me of.  The Moto G Pure has an IPS screen which looks great even with the blue light filter that tones down the blue light.  The A14 5G screen when you turn the built in blue light filter on just turns like an eerie yellowish orangish nasty color, I can't stand it.  The reasoning the screen is so bad is because Samsung is using a PLS LCD screen on this phone versus Motorola is using IPS screens in their budget phones which displays so much better in all scenarios.  The other thing since Samsung's cheaper phones don't have OLED screens, they can't use always on display, so you have no idea a notification came in if you have the sound off, you have to turn the screen on to see if anything came in.  Motorola has the Moto Peak display where if you bump, touch, lift the phone it displays time, battery level, and notifications briefly before it fades away which is awesome.  Overall the A14 5G is just disappointing due to the screen being garbage.  If you are looking for sub $200 phone, get a Moto G, they are the king of sub $200 or below $200 phones.  They just released the new Moto G Play 2023 which I think will be a better phone for the price. If you can pickup a Moto G 5G for the same price, that is way better than the A14 5G.","February 4, 2023"

I've been a Samsung S series fan for a while so I knew I'd get the S24, I went with the base model over the 24+ or Ultra because I prefer the smaller size.My initial impressions: Its a very fast phone, switches seamlessly between tasks and is lightning quick on searches, apps, ect.  The screen is beautiful, and the touch screen is VERY reactive. The battery life is also way better than i expect. I don't even charge my phone every night becasue i don't need to. It was also super easy to move to the new phone, just swapped over my sim card and was able to transfer my contacts ect with Samsung's transfer software with just a few clicks.The one negative: I find the S8 a more aesthetically pleasing phone.

The buttons on the side feel excellent - just the right size and resistance.The only possible negative - the camera lens cover reduced photo quality, created some unwanted stars and loss of sharpness, so I removed it.

I love the S7 but the CPU and RAM can't keep up with today's apps and websites. The S24 a decent phone with some annoying problems. It feels like a $400-500 phone.Here are my complaints:- The most annoying problem so far is that videos are glitchy, choppy, or laggy every few seconds. Whatever you want to call it, it's the opposite of smooth. This happens in every streaming app and website I've tried so it's not isolated to a single app. It's not a bandwidth or buffering issue. This happens in Adaptive (120 Hz) and Standard (60 Hz) motion smoothness. I enabled the Show Refresh Rate option in the Developer menu. I don't know if it's accurate, but every time a video gets laggy the refresh rate shows 24 (in Hz). When it shows 60 or 120 the video is smooth. The OS should should detect if a video is playing and sync to the frame rate of the video or set a fixed 60 Hz refresh rate.- The physical buttons click very loudly. When I hear that click my brain thinks ""cheap junk"". They're loudest buttons of any current or previous phone or tablet we own (which is a lot). I'm guessing this is a QC issue and most people don't experience this. I have resorted to using apps to open the volume control and turn off the screen so I don't need to click those buttons.- All three buttons are on the same side now. I need to use two hands to reliably take a screen shot. Yes, I have gotten it to work a couple times with only my right thumb but only after locking the screen and changing the volume a few times.- Samsung frequently nags me about signing in. I have uninstalled and disabled as many Samsung apps as possible, but it keeps asking me to sign in.","February 27, 2024"

Battery life in normal use is solid and charge rates for cabled charging are very fast. Photo quality is solid, overall it's a good phone.A major flaw is vehicle use and I use mine constantly for Spotify and running nav apps in my vehicles. One of my vehicles, a Subaru has wireless charging. There is no way to disable this in the phone or in the vehicle if you put the phone in the spot where it exists. This is the normal way to integrate Android Auto with the car's media system.The phone discharges faster than it charges while driving. The phone gets blistering hot with wireless charging (not on cable charging) and also Android Auto apparently drops operation if there isn't a cell signal. Car Play doesn't drop like this and I'm in a remote area with many cell coverage dead zones.I've swapped to using a cable to tether and charge in the car and so far it is not improving this issue. A long trip will mean the phone will die and I rely on the phone for navigation.I'll likely just put another RAM mount x-grip in this car to get it away from the wireless charging pad, but I'm not convinced the phone will charge fast enough to offset the running drain of the battery. I'll have to give it a try and see.Hopefully this will fix the issue, otherwise this phone will not work properly for vehicle nav and music use.They need to make it possible to turn off wireless charging, it's frustrating that this cannot be done.","July 18, 2024"

S10 is 5 years older so that isn't saying much.Lame:No more rounded edges or screen. SD card was great to be able to add more space when you download movies from apps.  No Headphone port, which has come in handy on OLD devices that only support aux inputs.The AI features are neat, but not all that useful. Maybe if you need to translate languages often. I'm not sure why the AI stuff can't be applied to any other phone, since a lot of it is offloaded to the cloud anyway.Seems to be an S23 with some software that could also work on the s23.

However, the sound quality is very disappointing.  Even at full volume, music playing from this phone is not nearly as loud as my old phone.  I see from the Samsung website that others have the same complaint.  I've shared this with Samsung.  Hopefully it's something that can be addressed with a software patch and not a hardware issue.  If anything changes in this regard, I'll update my review.Update: got an unhelpful response from Samsung yesterday.  Today, I tried listening to music through earbuds instead of using the phone speakers.  The left channel is almost completely muted.  I checked the equalizer and it's set for even distribution between left and right channels.  I've let Samsung know about this.  We'll see what happens.Update 2: Samsung tells me they've raised the issue w/their developers for further evaluation.  Meanwhile, I've noticed a second issue.  The screen flickers when I scroll with my finger.  This happens with all the applications on my phone. I've reported this to Samsung as well.Update 3: I've discovered the problem with the left channel.  The problem wasn't in the Equalizer.  In Settings > Accessibility > Hearing enhancements, the balance was incorrect.  I've corrected that, and now the sound is great with my earbuds.

There are plenty of things I didn't enjoy, but here are the top 3:1. The quality of the design has really gone down. If you hold it with your left hand, your fingers will be covering the cameras (why do they need 3 of them to be placed on top of one another?). They removed the 3.5mm jack so you can't just plug a wired headphones. You have to buy an adapter for the usb-c port which means you can't listen to music and video and charge it at the same time, e.g. when in a car.2. Why remove the option to schedule a phone turn on time. Similarly, why can't I turn off the phone at night (e.g. if I wanted to avoid disturbance and radiation) and have the alarm work with the phone off? Why can't that be an option like on other phones?3. The biggest headache I had is with transferring the data from my old phone. Why was the sd_card_backup file from the previous phone hidden? Who really needs the option in the file folders that switches between Essential/All files? Why would Samsung decide which files are essential? Even if you need the button for some reason, why leave the default to Essential (which hides the files you have downloaded and leaves the Samsung factory files)?I will postpone buying a new phone for as long as I can, and I'm not buying a Samsung phone anymore.","July 28, 2024"

I can already tell you period. The space gets eaten up really fast, even though they tell you it doesn't, The battery does not last as long as they say it does. I can barely get mine to last a few hours to a day.And it's mostly due to all the c*** that they download onto it like most phones, they have all this extra stuff they need to put on to the phone, to protect it. And you have to go through the phone. To take off a bunch of stuff that you know the phone doesn't need just so that you have space to put stuff on your phone, that you may or may not want. Or you end up having to go out if you're able to.To get a drive, this phone, unfortunately, does not have the ability To take an extra drive space, which sucksSo I recommend being careful with the space you've got. Something.The store did not tell me when I got the phone. Also, make sure that when and if you get your plan, that is the plan you want, because they have a bad habit of not paying attention or listening and just doing what they like, I had to go back and speak to customer service when I got home and change my plan to something I could afford. Because the store put me on something.I couldn't. From what I can tell the responsiveness to pretty much, most of the stuff on the phone, it's okay, some of the things when it comes to the gaming experience can be a little lag and a little slow.Charging is pretty quick, but like I said, the battery goes pretty fast.Period the camera seems to work. Okay. I've used it a couple times just to use it for rudimentary stuff around the house, just to give it a checkover.I haven't really tried it out for larger things, at least not yet.I'll probably do that a bit later on when I have something big.I know more than likely. I probably won't be holding onto this phone very long. It was just a temporary fix until I can get something that might hold me up a bit better as I planned on getting something with larger space.And most definitely better battery. I will definitely need something that can hold an sd card.","July 18, 2024"

So can't rate the hi tech features. Phone is mostly for occasional or emergency use, and don't much care about camera capabilities. My last phone was a budget phone, so this was a quantum leap upgrade. This one seems to first and foremost to have MUCH better reach to the tower, granted the 5G capability likely has something to do with that. First cell phone ever which works at my house, and I'm using the cheapest service provider there is here in the States, which I can't name here. Battery charges up fast, standby time is a lot better than my old phone ever was when new.Touch screen when scrolling and virtual keyboard and reorientation is snappy. Really like the adaptive brightness. Know most all phones now have wi-fi enabled calling, even my old phone once did but when changed service providers they no longer supported on the antiquated handset. Wi-fi enabled calling works GREAT on this phone. When my antiquated DSL isp was down recently, I actually used the 5G Samsung A54 as a hotspot for my computer.Like the size, personally find the glass back to be very slippery, I'd been just as happy with a hi quality plastic back.One thing worth noting is Samsung promises upgrades for several years. This was a new phone model in March of 2023, AND Amazon offered a 90 day return policy. Very important as needed to make sure would work with my service provider. Thought was they might need to send a new SIM card, and by that time return window could close. Happily, no problems old SIM card plugged right in, and presto phone was working within minutes.Also for a great price, this is brand new handset, not one which was supposedly ""refurbished"", used, customer return whatever.  Has a recent Android version, so wasn't buying some phone already out of date when I got it, like my last one was. (Samsung Galaxy J3, was a good little phone for the money and served well).Note the charger brick is not included, although the type C charging cable is. Most people probably have a spare charger or two laying around, but not in my case. Work around was: used the AC adapter for my MacBook Pro until got to the store and picked up a charger brick for the type C cable. Also got a legacy USB2 cable to Type C usb cable which allows the use of older AC charger bricks or older car cigarette lighter adapters.All in all two thumbs up, I mean what is not to like!","January 23, 2024"

Decent camera, good features, and a nice, snappy, responsive interface.  Also love the fact that these still take an microSD card.I didn't realize until I was done that they provided a transfer cable to move data from my old phone to my new one.  I also didn't realize the transfer software copied everything from my old SD card, which was unnecessary and took a lot of time.I would have given it 5 stars except for a few things:1. No headphone jack2. The fingerprint reader can be kind of iffy3. Samsung keeps nagging me to get an account on their cloud and use it for backups.  Why?  That's what Google is for.

"SAMSUNG Galaxy A54 5G A Series Cell Phone, Unlocked Android Smartphone, 128GB, 6.4” Fluid Display Screen, Pro Grade Camera, Long Battery Life, Refined Design, US Version, 2023, Awesome Black",r2,5.0,"I got this phone after my iPhone XR broke and so I was a bit hesitant to switch over to android but I do not regret it. I'll make this to the point so I don't waste your time.Pros:- Battery life: I've had the phone for about 2 months now so I can't speak too much on the degradation but the battery on this is very good. On a full charge this will last me pretty much all day with maybe about 10-20% left at night with heavy usage. If you don't plan on using this phone all day you will be more than fine with the battery on this thing.- Multitasking: I can run multiple apps on this thing with no problems at all. I think the only time the phone might be overworked would be if you were video editing or gaming plus also trying to run something else at the same time but i'm not sure who would even do that lol.-Screen: The screen quality of this phone and with the high refresh rate makes it great for viewing at all times. I will say on a very sunny day you will have to turn the brightness all the way up to see but apart from that I have no complains about the screen for this phone and I think at this price range you won't find much better.Cons:- Camera: Now this one is definitely debatable as i've seen some people like and dislike the camera on here but for me I just feel like it's lacking in certain areas. The selfie camera is usable but coming from the iPhone I felt like it was pretty much the same with a little worse video quality. I will say the portrait mode on the camera is really good and the main camera is generally very good for the price, although zooming in at all past 2x will be pretty bad image/video quality. I do want to reiterate though this might depend on your preferences so id encourage to go find camera comparisons out there but I think for casual photography/video taking and with good lighting the camera will get the job done.-Finger print reader: Outside of the camera this was my only other nuisance with the phone, and don't get me wrong this is a first world problem but sometimes the finger printer reader lags behind or I need to get a good finger placement on it. It's not the biggest deal in the world but it can be a bit annoying having to scan my finger multiple times to get through. I don't use facial recognition so I can't speak on that but for the finger print reading it's definitely not as responsive as the higher end Samsung phones.Overall there is very little complains I have about this phone and I think for anyone who's looking for just general phone use you won't get much better than this and you're getting a phone with a reliable brand in Samsung so in case something happens it will be serviceable easier than maybe some other international brans out there.","May 21, 2024"

The fingerprint sensor, and modem were supposed to be improved over my old Pixel 6, but sadly, I didn't see it. That is when I decided to try this A54. While it may not be quite as fast as the Pixel, and it doesn't have voice type, or phone monitoring, it is an extremely well-balanced phone. It feels premium, and the software has a very smooth fluid feel to it. Also, the fingerprint scan has never failed me, and the cell signal is about 10% better than both the Pixel 6, and 7a. The bonus is that I got it on Prime Day and saved about $130. Features are nice, but reliable unlocking, and great cell signal with a smooth OS are priceless.Update 8/26/23: I've had this phone for a tad over 5 weeks now, and it is getting to be my favorite phone I've had. It is very smooth, super reliable, and does everything I need. On paper, this phone is no powerhouse compared to flagships, but I don't miss the extra power one bit. I'm not a gamer but I play games and I'm not a photographer but I shoot very nice pictures. Not once have I missed the extra power. That said, my biggest complaint with Pixels was the biometric security. Fingerprint sensors, and face recognition for me was 85%. This A54 has never failed to open on the first try since I've had it. Like I said, if you want the fastest phone this isn't it, but pleasingly fast everyday use doesn't always mean the latest processors.","July 19, 2023"

I expected to be delighted, and I was at first. The phone lived up to the hype I'd read in reviews. Bright , colorful screen, good cameras, efficient design. But by the time I finished setting it up, I realized the battery was draining super fast. I can't use the phone for more than 3 or 4 hours before the battery drains. I called Samsung, and a very helpful technician diagnosed by remote control, concluding nothing was wrong in software or settings, suggesting the battery must be defective.That where the helpfulness ended. Neither Samsung nor Amazon will replace the phone. Samsung washes their hands of responsibility short of directing me to a location an hour away where a technician might be able to repair the phone. Of course, repair is unacceptable. I ordered a new, perfect phone, and that's what I deserve to have. There's supposed to be a 14-day replacement policy, according to Samsung, but I have to get that from Amazon. Amazon will not replace the phone, saying only, ""we don't have that option in our system."" They want me to mail it back and have it ""evaluated by a technician"" for possible refund of replacement. Imagine my shock that they won't just send me a new phone.I called Samsung back, and they refuse to help in any way. They aren't even listening to me. I just spent 20 minutes telling a customer care rep the whole story (for the tenth time) and even though I specified repeatedly that I bought the phone from Amazon, he ended the call by telling me one of the reasons he couldn't help me is that he doesn't know from whom I bought the phone. Needless to say, I will never buy another Samsung product. I can also say I'm dismayed and angry that Amazon doesn't have my back. I've spent hours on the phone today trying to have a defective phone replaced, and I've got nothing to show for it, other than a defective phone that won't hold a charge.","July 8, 2023"

Shame on Samsung US for not offering that phone!The A54 5g phone for the US offers both eSIM and physical SIM capability, so we can travel abroad without have to physically remove our US SIM. We use Consumer Cellular, which resells AT&T (and used to resell T-Mobile). The A54 5g is priced a bit higher than the A30 series, but still far less than the top end domestic offerings. Who needs to pay $1,000 for a phone? Every few years? Really?My wife bought the A54 5g when it was introduced on the Consumer Cellular website; it was a great introductory buy at $300. I bought this for a bit more, and only within the last few months. Still, there isn't a better (my opinion) mid range phone available on the market (well, the US market, at least).We live in an almost dead zone, about 2 miles away in opposite directions from cell towers (and the digital coverage at our house is about 1 bar). Still, this phone makes and receives calls very well; we augment that by using WiFI calling through our Xfinity router. Call coverage is good.I preferred the A30s fingerprint reader, under the screen on the front, compared to on the side of this phone. ALso, unless you autolock the screen within about 5-10 seconds of last use, and happen to toss it into your pocket, you may find that the screen is so sensitive in your pocket that you will inadvertantly open the screen and exercise home screen icons, including the phone. Imagine my surprise when I got a call back from the 9-1-1 operator asking what my emergency was. Oops, pocket dial, my bad. So I've taken to a minimal active screen time and making sure the screen is black before I put the phone in my pocket. Other than that, no issues. Enjoy!","June 9, 2024"

I have no interest in having a mobile phone that is a status symbol or fashion accessory.  I'm an unoppressed minority...  one of the few that try to get as much life as possible out of my mobile phones and I think I found a good option here.For a mid-range smart phone, the camera is very competitive. Battery life is mediocre, although I do really like that I can cap the charging at 85% to extend the battery's lifetime. I also like that the operating system does seem to be managing app behaviors to improve battery life, although this feature does cause a few minor problems now and then.This is not my first Samsung phone. I moved away from Samsung years ago, mainly because their better phones dropped support for memory cards and because of the preinstalled bloatware. Some of the Samsung apps are very useful, other's not at all. I would prefer that the customer was given the option to install the apps from the Samsung store, rather than bog down the device with apps that never get used. I'm disappointed there is no headphone jack. This would be easier to swallow if Samsung included a USB C headphone adaptor - unfortunately that was not the case. And speaking of things not included... no charger is included. The lack of a charger didn't bother me though, since I have a large assortment of USB chargers and the phone does seem to take advantage of industry standard fast charging on the chargers that support this. The price tag made some really wild swings during the time I purchased. Fortunately, I was able to purchase at a low spot.In summary - The camera, the memory card slot, OS/security update support, and the price tag (at times) make this phone a winner in my opinion.","June 23, 2024"

I was planning on the previous S20 series or a oneplus 12r since it was more affordable than the s24 but realized I don't use my phone to the fullest... just talk, text an youtube (I don't play games or anything else) So I went budget an got this one instead!  (not to mention the 12R only gets 3 years of updates while the a54 gets 5 as of release... also the camera is a nice upgrade bonus even though I don't take much pictures or record... The only real problem i've had with this phone is the fingerprint reader, the bottom of the phone screen is used to read registered finger prints and so far it works find for unlocking your phone but some apps that have the option will not register the fingerprint, my bank app has a finger reader an when I put my finger on the phone to scan it will read it but nothing will happen so I end using a password instead.  Its not really a big deal unless you use fingerprints a lot but otherwise its fine for just unlocking your phone!So if you don't really use your phone like a maniac an wanna save money this one is pretty much worth it especially for a budget level phone!","February 12, 2024"

Sounds like someone has mixed the used phones with the new wherever these ship from. Although not the phone's fault, I took a star for this.As for the phone itself, I'm very happy. This was the only phone I could find that still supported SD card storage. I have too much data for cloud storage and I'm not pleased with the current trends in phones where features are taken while the prices rise.The phone works very smoothly.

A couple of professional reviews thought that the color rendering was too vivid; however, I found that the A54’s display settings can be changed from “vivid” to “natural” so the reviewers may have been looking at the vivid rather than the natural display setting.  I’ve yet to find out how my photos look on my laptop or other display, however.For me, the A54’s competition was the Pixel 7/7A or I could have waited for the Pixel 8.  When I made my purchase, the 7A was $100 more than the A54.  I would have paid more for an arguably better phone whose camera can make blurry photos sharper; however, the 7/7A has an issue with spontaneous lens shatter, also an issue with the preceding Pixel 6/6A, and I didn’t anticipate it being fixed in the Pixel 8.  I could imagine being on vacay and no longer able to take pictures, a total bummer since I’m such a shutterbug.  BTW, during my last vacay I took most of my pix with a DSLR that has a fairly decent 18 MP resolution.  The A54’s main camera has 50 MP, so my DSLR is in danger of gathering dust in the closet, if you know what I mean.Now on to the phone (sorta joking about buying a camera that makes phone calls).  Since Verizon has not great reception in my apartment building, I was concerned about whether my new phone could do Wi-Fi calling or whether I would have to go outside in the winter to talk on the phone.  Answer:  Yes, the A54 can make Wi-Fi calls with Verizon!  So far, crystal clear call quality with some intermittent static.The A54’s user interface is very intuitive, easier than my work phone (iPhone 11) or even my old Samsung S7.  There were some preloaded apps that I don’t need, so I just removed them.There is some flak these days about cell phones having a USB C data cable, no charging plug, and no earphones.  I already have many charging plugs and ear phones, bought an inexpensive USB C-to-USB adapter for the data/charging cable, and plan to buy a USB C-to-headphone jack adapter rather than ear buds.I set up fingerprint unlock, which works fine.  I will probably set up face recognition as well.Even if I had paid more than $349 (the S7 was $400 in 2017), I would still be completely satisfied with my A54 and highly recommend it!","September 2, 2023"

After reading so many conflicting reviews, I gave up and went to Samsung's website to verify this phone. They stated that it does support two Sim cards. One reviewer said he returned his phone when it did not have a second sim card slot.Here's the thing, it has the standard pop out SIM and SD card holder that most phones have AND it has a built in eSIM. Both the SIM & eSIM have an IMEI, those numbers never change, like serial numbers.The way the second sim card, the eSIM is activated is through your carrier. They can generate a QR code for you to scan or you can type it in. It takes several steps with the SIM Manager. Your carrier can also cancel the QR code and re-issue it.They were not familiar with this particular model and it took several tries for them to get mine to work.It took several days to get it done so if you are in a hurry to have service I would suggest using the physical SIM first.Mine already had my primary cell number working and the eSIM is where I had my land line ported.So, yes, I have two numbers working on my Galaxy A54 5G, both are local numbers here in the US.My overall impression of the A54 is that it is full of apps that will serve no purpose for my needs but it is a solid well put together phone. I do 99% of my work on a PC and the phone is when needed. It will take a while for me to get familiar with the phone and determine which apps running in the background can be removed or turned off. I think that should help out with the battery life. It's not bad but it isn't as good as the battery life on my Motorola Moto, that would last three days or longer.Bottom line is I would probably purchase this phone again. Don't ask about pictures and video, I haven't had a chance to try them out but they are known to be top notch.","December 21, 2023"

All I did was moving the SIM card from Note 5 which is no longer getting updates since 2018.  I'll show you howto self activate at the end.  9 out of 10 apps on Note 5 are no longer supported by play store lol.  What a big noticeable change.  I was worried this is going to be a waste of money, used returned beaten up item, and negative reviews left on CDMA carrier like Verizon, nah I'm like a little kid on Xmas eve again.  I bought this on Cyber Monday deal *used like new condition* with 20%, warehouse deal out of the door was 270.  Was it a gamble?  Yes, lucky hit.  Everything works as advertised.  So far could not tell why this phone was returned.  It doesn't appeared to be used at all.  80% battery power appears to be default so I don't think last user even turned it on.  Spent about an hour got all the updates all the way up to Nov 1st patch, still waiting for UI6/Android14 - updates dropped me to 60% power - how nice, can't say the same thing with my old note 5.  I can't speak for other carrier but Verizon is notorious for dropping call priority once you've used your SIM card past 18 months.  If you've used it past 18 months, do exactly as I'm telling you.  Go to a Verizon store with your old phone, tell them excuse me I've had this SIM card for the past 18 months and I'm getting call delay.  They will give you a free brand new SIM card, make sure it said 5G on it.  I don't think they have any more 4G sim so you don't need to worry and also not worry if your old phone takes 5G or not - SIM cards are backward compatible.  Have them install the SIM card, make sure it works on your old phone.  Great go home, open your new A54 swap out the SIM card right away hahah enjoy :)","December 1, 2023"

I can easily get though the day on a single charge (maybe 2 days if the phone is not used a lot).There are a couple of negatives.  One being that it takes a much longer time for the phone to power on if I turn it off or restart it.The other negative (a major one for me) is the swipe functionality when sending  a text.  The phone almost always picks up the wrong word that I am trying to type.  It also does not seem to ""learn"" (that is remember the words that I have type before).

All of the manuals online, Samsung etc show that in the Sim Manager, there is a Preferred SIM Card setting. So if you are using two sims, a physical one and an e-sim, you can use the settings to set which card does calls, which does sms, and which does data.That's very important when going overseas. You still need to receive calls on your physical sim, but set the esim to use Airalo or similar for roaming data.EXCEPT - these settings are MISSING from this version of the phone. It may be restricted somewhere, but after hours on chat with Samsung support, they tell me this exact model of the phone doesn't come with that option.So if you want to use it overseas with an esim for roaming, the functionality is severly restricted by not being able to choose which sim is for calls and which sim is for data.

I did not want to replace our phones; the older Motorola and Lg phones were wonderful, but I got really sick of the vendors not updating them after two years.  That, and around 3 years in, the phones always seem to start developing mysterious issues that they never had before (e.g, needing frequent restarts to get the audio to work) - just like the vendor is trying to force you to buy something new.  I really do not like that.The main draw here, besides good ratings, was the promise that the software would be updated for FOUR years.I'm not really all that impressed.  Maybe it is just getting used to something different, but I do find many things missing compared to the same priced phones from Motorola and LG.  For example, the phone does not have a proximity detector or a metal detector, and the disgusting nag software that is included from Samsung really ticks me off.  Taking a long time to weed it out.  There are some nice new features too, so it is not all bad, just not as good as I had expected.One of the most irritating things is that you often cannot just tap a ""button""; instead, you have to hold on it and swipe some direction.  Two really annoying places this shows up is when the phone rings, and you have two buttons available - one to answer and one to reject.  No instructions on the screen at all, but neither button works unless you tap/hold/swipe Up.  My Motorola phone shows just one button, and you swipe up to answer and down to reject, but the key is that it TELLS you that right on the screen!Another even worse situation is when the calendar sends you an alert, and the big ""Dismiss"" button on the bottom does NOTHING at all!  I am still not sure what works to actually dismiss those alerts - after a few minutes of tapping, screaming, cussing, etc., I just hide the phone under a pillow and leave the room.  I do not know if any of these issues are specific to all Samsung phones or just this A54, but either way it makes me wish I  had not bought it.","August 6, 2023"

I got this A54 since it was the same price, but there are some major difference.First off, if you can get an almost like new S22 for under $500, you will have a much faster phone, smoother UI experience, better quality picture, better looking display that can get brighter. The A54 has a slightly larger screen, but since it's the same FHD+ resolution, it's actually a lower DPI and text doesn't look as good. The camera on the A54 is good, but the S22 is better if you can get it for under $500. Both phones have good call quality, but the Speakerphone on the A54 has more speaker distortion at max volume than the S22. I do like that the A54 has a 5000mah battery to last longer. But the major advantage of the A54 vs the S22 (besides the battery) is that the A54 has a microSD card slot! There is no reason why Samsung can't include this on the S series, as the S20 was rhe last to have the memory card slot.So the summery is, if you specifically want a good mid range phone, the A54 is a good choice, and you have a larger battery with microSD support. But if you want a better (higher end) phone, then look for a like-new renewed S22 for the same price. Between the two, I preferred the S22.","April 11, 2023"

The sleep mode suddenly stopped working, which should have silenced all notifications and calls after the times I set. It worked before the updates, but not anymore.  Then, Some text notifications were muted and others weren't - it was totally random. And despite spending hours on the phone with their tech support teams, the problems only got worse after another update was pushed out about a week ago.  Now I have a floating bubble on the home page over new text messages I rec'd.  And the other issues never got resolved.I spoke with 3-4 different tech's (all of who could barely speak understandable English) after combined hours trying to fix the problems, which they still haven't done, they all used the same tactic - do a reset while on a remote connection to my phone with their (not so) Smart Tutor app.  And it also severed the phone connection when it turned off & restarted.  And even though they all asked for phone number so they could call me back after being disconnected, NOT ONE of them did. They all disappeared, never to heard from again - not a single one of them.I will never buy another Samsung product, not just because of the technical issues, which all phones & mobile devices have at some point, but also because of how their tech 'experts' pulled a vanishing act when they finally realized they couldn't fix the problems.

I'll summarize:* 6GB RAM* 128GB storage (all phones should be at 128 GB minimum these days)* Dual SIM *and* micro-sd expansion - yes, a physical sim and SD card slot *plus* esim* Variable refresh (60hz to 120hz) display* 5G* Compatible with virtually any carrier* Under-display fingerprint reader that works remarkably well* 3 OS updates and 5 years of security updates guaranteed from SamsungI had a Motorola G Power before this. It was an excellent value, but you're lucky if Motorola supports more than 1 OS update and more than 2 years of security updates these days.

It's a good deal for a budget phone. IT COMES WITH AN SD CARD SLOT! The camera is really nice. I can put tons of apps on here and not have to worry about space.Cons: TONS of unnecessary in-your-face bloatware. I mean tons. Even if you are texting Samsung tries to get in your face. This will be my last Samsung Product. If you buy this, you will spend hours uninstalling crap and Samsung will still ask you to store your passwords or use their cloud. It's unacceptable and I absolutely regret this purchase. I gave Samsung one more chance and they burned me.To be fair, it's not Samsung's fault. I knew what they were about and went with them anyway, because I wanted the SD card. Which it does have!! (Hence 2 stars)The worst part is the screen unlocks randomly. Think about that. If my phone is protected by face recognition, fingerprint, and PIN how is it unlocking in my pocket? If someone wants to break into my phone and steal my info all they have to do is put my phone in their pocket and walk around? Not acceptable. It's an invasion of my privacy.I work nights, someone I haven't talked to in 10 years received 4 random texts from me at 3:30 AM. That was embarrassing.Don't go with Samsung.

My American Airlines app glitched out, wouldn't load boarding passes and refused to work until I restarted the phone, almost missed my flight on that one. Many issues with Google maps.

I usually only get a couple bars of service where I live in the High Desert in CA, but the data speeds are plenty fast. My previous phone was a Moto G7 plus, which is only a couple years old, but I couldn't get clear calls even though my T=Mobile signal was 4 bars or more, and wifi sucked as well. It was time to move to 5G apparently, because the Samsung works flawlessly,  I can actually understand people when they call, the texts come thru in a reasonable amount of time, and it functions very well. It was more than 2 1/2 times what I paid for the moto, but well worth it in my view.","July 12, 2023"

I mainly got sick of the bad camera on the OnePlus so the return to Samsung solved that issue. The immediate value is on the fabulous screen and pleasant interface. The sound quality is also great although no traditional headphone jack was a bummer. The interface is pleasant but I personally like OnePlus better in ways. The camera is good but I would fault the focus and the image detail isn't like say an iPhone. The biggest downsides are the very slow charging and the bulk of the phone. It was like going backwards 2 or 3 years compared to my super fast charging and lightweight OnePlus. By the time you put this phone in a decent case it's a real heavy chunk.,"July 12, 2023"

I really needed a mid tier phone with a good quality camera. I take pictures of products for work and need stunning images, so this was the #1 most important feature to me... and I'm blown away. These are near-flagship quality images for a fraction of the price. Here are some images I took with it:1. A comparison between my older Moto G Stylus 5G (left) and the A54 (right). I consider the Moto G to have a pretty decent camera and I've taken some stunning shots with it, but this is a level up. Notice that the Moto G really struggles with underexposure of the subject when trying to compensate for the brightly lit window behind it. The A54 photo is definitely overexposed in that spot too, but the main subject doesn't lose any detail.2. Same 2 pictures but zoomed in. The loss of fine detail and underexposure is even more apparent in the Moto G Stylus photo. The A54 photo is crisp and retains some fine details here which is impressive.3. 3:4 50MP mode.4. Same photo, zoomed in. The resolution here is phenomenal. If you zoom in even further, you can see the individual pixels on the can label.5. Macro mode. Again the fine detail here is stunning.6-8: 3:4 50MP mode. Notice the clarity, fine detail, vividness and crispness of these images. I love how vivid the colors are.9. 32MP selfie camera. This camera is powerful and picks up details I'm not sure I even want it to, to be honest. Thankfully, though, it also has the skin smoothing effect to mitigate this. 32MP on a selfie camera in general is new to me and very impressive.Overall I give this phone's camera a 9.5/10. The only thing it lacks is a telephoto lens, but I wouldn't expect this in a $325 phone. Also, some of the images do come out slightly oversaturated which could be a problem if you want ""natural"" looking, slightly less vivid photos. Personally, though, I actually prefer this vibrant, enhanced look, so for my needs it's a straight up 10/10.Now that I've written an entire novel on this phone's camera, which is probably the most underrated aspect of anything in the world of consumer electronics today, let's talk briefly about the phone itself.1. I love that it's IP67 water resistant. I do not plan to test this, but I've ruined many phones by dropping them in the toilet or taking them in the rain so I like that I don't have to worry as much about that.2. Battery life is decent. Today, I charged it overnight to 100%. I had a video call with my therapist and after that I've been editing images on full brightness for a few hours. Then I wrote this review, which took like 45 minutes. I have not plugged it in again and at 4:30pm, I still have 68%. This is impressive.3. Love the size. My Moto G Stylus 5G was a bit too big to hold comfortably in my hand. This phone is just a tad bit smaller and easier to hold, but still has a big beautiful display.4. The awesome purple color is just the cherry on top of an amazing phone.Overall: Vastly underrated phone for a phenomenal price.","November 28, 2023"

I was able to verify the IMEI number on Spectrum's website, and just swapping in her previous SIM card, everything worked. Since Spectrum uses the Verizon network, I assume this means it would also work with Verizon, but use the IMEI trick with any carrier to verify first.

Frankly, you won't notice what's missing. I will say, if having wireless charging is a deal breaker for you, this is not the phone for you, as it doesn't have it.  Like all Samsung phones it was a little annoying to set up with all the little settings you want to customize, but it's made infinitely easier with the Smart Switch app, which will move *most* of your apps and settings over.The camera is really great, sound quality for music and voice is good.  Some people have had difficulty hearing me when I have it on speaker, but I think that's more a deficit of the room I am in when using that method of calling.  Using an ear bud, or going into another room, solves that.  I'm still getting used to the feel of it in my hand, as it's a little thicker and squarer than the S series phones. It's not off-putting, though, just different.The lavender color makes it attractive and is only available in retail versions, not from your carrier or even Samsung itself.","December 5, 2023"

The hardware is great, especially the camera.  The battery lasts well over a day for her usage.  We don't use the facial recognition or fingerprint reader.When setting up the phone one of the first thing you're asked is to create a Samsung account.  I didn't want to do this, as we've got enough cloud accounts, and didn't want yet another 3rd party gathering information on our lives.  Unfortunately, the only way to automatically migrate your apps from your old phone to new is to use the Samsung Smart Switch app.  This surprised us... our older phones just used Google's cloud and restored beautifully.  I searched online for alternatives, but it appears you need a Samsung cloud account and this Samsung app to easily migrate apps, Samsung's ""skin"" software appears to have disabled the Google app backup/restore feature..  We had to manually install the apps instead.  Annoying, as migrating app data one at a time is tedious.I'd rate this phone 5 stars if it wasn't for the required Samsung cloud to migrate apps.

I mainly do Whatsapp video calls but also phone calls.  Also during video calls, my voice is not in sync with the video sometimes.  It has sometimes worked ok and then it randomly doesn't work again.I never had these issues withmy older S8+ Phone-  i switched back to talking on that phone and everything works well but they I use this A54 and the mic and sometimes video issue happens again!I also noticed that the video stabilizer for the camera is very blurry when you take video but when I turn that off, the video looks better.I dis what I could as some people also said doing the updates fixed their mic issue.  Its fully updated, I gave permissions for mic use, cleared the cache for whatsapp and other phone apps, restarted my phone, disabled Bixby Voice (which others say solved their mic issue), contacted Samsung Support- and the issue is still happening!So frustarting because I like this phone.Everything else on this phone works nicely but the most important thing- the mic and video issue during video calls and phone calls- is not working.Of course I'm returning this phone and I'm debating on whether I should buy this same model phone again or just get another type of phone.","March 21, 2024"

My hands are small so it was uncomfortable and really slippery without a case, but I got a case immediately and it's more manageable to hold now.Battery life is absolutely amazing. I can't believe how great it is. And I use my phone HEAVILY. Watching videos, gaming, muli tasking with a billion tabs open and not once did my phone die on me. Had it for a month so far.","February 3, 2024"

I needed unlocked phones and selected this make and model due to the reviews and the fact that it was a well-known brand.  It's taking a bit of getting used to since our previous phones were another brand- and very old (for a cell phone).  We have had no issues with the setup.  The only thing I don't like is that it cannot be charged wirelessly.  Had I looked at the specs in more detail, I would have known that prior to the purchase.  I may not have chosen this model had I known that.  However, the phones charge up very quickly once plugged in.  Overall I like the phones and will make do without wireless charging.","July 18, 2023"

There is a bit of an adjustment period, but it is absolutely worth it. The amount of customization, especially related to notifications is amazing. I used to have an iphone 13 and can honestly say this phone is pretty on par with it, except for a few minor things. The phone vibration for notifications  is a little weak even on the highest setting, though I have gotten used to it.  The front facing camera is not as good as apple's, but I don't take any selfies so it's far from an issue for me. The back cameras seem to be much better than apple's though.

Very basic phone, nothing fancy. However that phone was durable and well made. This phone is cheaply made. Feels like cheap plastic, easily slips out of hand if you don't have a phone case on it. It's a thicker phone so when it vibrates you hear the echo thru the phone. Seems to lag a lot especially when you've been using it for a while. Overheats easily. Also the screen seems to have a mind of it's own. If your just reading something suddenly your phone will be going to the webpage from an ad without you touching anything. The pros are good battery life so far. And it's a 5g phone. I guess the price to because I don't need a $1000+ dollar phone I just need the basics. But compared to my last phone the quality is definitely lacking. Lastly this phone isn't huge but it's a lot bigger than my last phone so holding it with one hand can definitely be uncomfortable after a while so a phone case and ring to hold the phone are a must.","August 17, 2023"

Got this at $599 on prime day. Amazon's competitor also had a sale earlier in the year.  It is new, and when i registered with samsung said the warranty is good for a year. That means that this is really a new phone.  It is hard to tell these days which vendor is selling new, and which ones are used (climate pledge friendly...renewed :) .It is impossible to search for NEW .  That means that it is the US version phone (one sim slot, and one esim). I have not verified  esim.The audio through the bose soundlink is a little different from the apple sound. I am tinkering with the synthesizer(hard to find online examples). I cleared up the echo noises, but still need to work on the bass.  There is about a 30gb memory hogged up by samsung setup and bloatware.  Still having glitches with whatsapp history through the smartswitch  cable transfer.The camera is better than the iphone 8plus,  but not sure about it compared to more up to date phones. at 30 x  and a distance of 8 feet away,  the image is less detailed than if you are 3 feet away with normal zoom 1x. But at $599, it is great. I will have to learn this camera system better.  Minor video games, surfing will work for a day and a half(same as iphone 8 plus) playing candy crush saga, scrabble, solitaire. With a 25watt charger, it takes about 45 minutes to charge from 45% to full charge.  Wireless charging is slow with the phone case and wireless charger. 25 watt plugin and 10 wireless charger). Fingerprint works so so  (reset it when i put on a new screensaver ) and have not tried the facial recognition.  The touch times out after 5 attempts. setup the index finger and thumb for both hands.

"Samsung Galaxy S23 Unlocked Android Smartphone, 128GB, 50MP Camera, Night Mode, 8K Video, Long Battery Life, Fastest Mobile Processor, Adaptive Display, US Version, Phantom Black",Susan Esposito,4.0,"Needed a new phone after my last one ran out of security updates. I liked my previous Galaxy S10E and decided to stick to a straight upgrade. Bought on Prime Day for 50 dollars more than the MSRP of the (oversized and lower spec) S23FE.Unfortunately, it came with a dead pixel from the factory and needed the screen replaced. Warranty covered it, but still sucks that it slipped through QC.Since getting that sorted, I'm very happy with the phone. Battery life is great, transfer from my previous device was smooth, it seems to run games well if you care about that in a phone,Only other issue is that it charges very slowly, and my wireless car charger that worked with my S10E's fast charging is apparently not compatible with the S23's fast charging. Not sure what changed there. No charger is included.5 years of security updates should get me well into 2028, by which point the EU's new rules requiring user-replaceable batteries will have kicked in and affected manufacturing worldwide, so now it's just a matter of maintaining the battery's health until B-day.As of this writing, it's approximately 2 months to go before the S24 is announced. Unless that phone introduces an unexpected game-changing must-have feature (QI2 magnetic charging is likely, but that doesn't matter much to me), this one will still serve you extremely well and should easily last until you can (finally!!) get a user-serviceable device again.","October 15, 2023"

I think I'm jealous. There's great contrast and saturation to colors, and it gives life to the photos taken. There's so much more detail as well. Not a fan of using it for selfies for that same reason though haha!As for software, I think it was fairly simple to setup and relatively straightforward.

No matter what I did. I never could hear my son on his phone either so I believed it to be an apple issue not a me issue. Apple phones for some reason sound so soft to me.So I switched back to the samsung galaxy. The phone is not my favouirte. Half the time it won't read my fingerprint. The pictures are OK but not as good quality as I excepted for a new phone. Limited features. And as it won't read my fingerprint very often I don't have to touch the xxx thing and like this morning it placed an order for me. apparently I can't remove my information without doing an entire factory reset.I hate you have to go to your contacts for phone number then an app for voicemail. I was told it had voice to text but my phone always says its unavailable. I can't use this bixby thing correctly and it makes it hard I won't set up to my blue tooth in my car so its useless. Picture taking is omg annoying. to screen shot I have to use two buttons on the same side at the same time. The entire phone is clumsy. I do not like it. I wasn't allowed to return it so now I'm stuck with this heap of crap until I decided to eat the cost and buy a different phone.Oh they have the volume control on the side so when you hold your phone in your hand it turns it up and down.

After 30 minutes,  he said he was going to transfer me to another department so I could exchange the phone.After 10 minutes, he was finally able to transfer me.  They made me repeat everything I told the technician and then told me I couldn't simply exchange the phone and I couldn't get the same credit for turning in my old phone because the deal had ended.  I told them the phone was defective, I have had the phone less than two weeks, and it has been defective since I pulled it out of the box. I just want a working phone and I shouldn't have to pay extra for it.  They said let me see what I can do.  They put me on hold and hung up on my 3 minutes later.I called back.  I got a new guy who said I would need to return the phone and buy it again and they would price match.  But, get this, YOU HAVE TO RETURN EVERYTHING IN YOUR ORDER AND REORDER IT.  And, not only do you have to return everything in the order and reorder it, you have to return them in separate boxes with separate shipping labels.  He prepared the order and sent me a link. The total was higher than what I originally paid. He said, when I return the items, they will return the original amount plus the difference between the two orders.  We'll see.  I loved my previous Samsung devices, but this may be the last one I ever purchase.  This is the most convoluted exchange for a defective item I have ever had to deal with.Original review 12/8/23: This phone has the worst GPS service of any phone I have have owned - including off-brand phones.  My Samsung S10e got a great signal in almost every building I was ever in.  If you're indoors and more than 2 inches from the window, this dumb thing is like ""GPS?  What's that? ""  I'm not using hyperbole; it's truly that bad.  Sometimes it's even slow to aquire a signal when I'm outdoors on a clear day.Data service isn't much better. If you move away from the window, web pages start loading like 3G hasn't even been invented yet.  I'm going to contact Samsung and see if I just got a defective phone.  If this is just how the S23 performs, I'm sticking with the S10e.  It's an awesome phone, my battery is just getting old so it doesn't hold a charge as well.","December 8, 2023"

Back when the S10 generation was out they had the S10E for people like me to choose from, great phone, but no smaller option in this generation.  Oh well.  Then I tried to pull the SD card out of my S10E and put in my S23 and :brakes screech:  no SD card slot!  and this is after discovering no headphone jack either.  I frequently plug my phone into various stereos to stream music so that's a bummer.  Then it doesn't come with a charger!?  Saving E waste!?  It doesn't work if you don't charge it!

Samsung processes the 50 MP photos that actually over tints the yellow, reduces the sharpness, and degrades the image.

Hoy tenemos al elegante y compacto Samsung Galaxy S23. Vamos a ver sus pros y contras con un toque de glamour.”Pros:Tamaño Compacto: El Galaxy S23 entra a la pasarela con una actitud segura y un tamaño que dice: “¡Soy manejable y cómodo!” 🌟Pantalla AMOLED 2X: Su pantalla Dynamic AMOLED 2X de 6,1 pulgadas es como un lienzo brillante para tus ojos. ¡Es como si la pantalla dijera: ‘¡Mírame, soy fabulosa!’* 🌈Rendimiento Estelar: Equipado con el procesador Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Samsung y 8 GB de RAM LPDDR5X, el S23 se desliza por la pasarela sin esfuerzo. 💫Cámara Versátil: La configuración de cámara trasera es como un trío de modelos: el sensor principal de 50 Mpx, el telefoto de 10 Mpx y el gran angular de 12 Mpx. ¡Son la envidia de todas las otras cámaras! 📸Diseño Premium: El S23 desfila con laterales curvados, una trasera de cristal y una certificación IP68. ¡Es resistente al agua y al polvo, como una supermodelo que no teme a la lluvia! ☔Precio Competitivo: A partir de 959 euros, este teléfono es como un vestido de diseñador a precio de tienda de segunda mano. ¡Una ganga! 💰Contras:Batería Moderada: La batería de 3.900 mAh es como los tacones altos: elegantes pero no ideales para una maratón. 🏃‍♀️Carga No Incluida: El cargador no está en la caja, como si el S23 dijera: “¡Soy independiente! Consígueme un cargador tú misma”. 🔌No es el Modelo Más Avanzado: Aunque es fabuloso, no tiene todas las características del Galaxy S23 Ultra.

"SAMSUNG Galaxy S23 Ultra Series AI Phone, Unlocked Android Smartphone, 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM, 200MP Camera, Night Mode, Long Battery Life, S Pen, US Version, 2023, Phantom Black",Mr. Eddie S.,5.0,"Firstly I was pretty skeptical of purchasing an unlocked phone never owning one before but so far this device has been nothing but first class performance. The only issue I have had so far is with getting this masterpiece to do wifi calling, but I have this same problem with my Galaxy S20 Plus and was able to figure out how to get it working and I have high hopes that the same will happen here. I have tried the moon zoom and it was spectacular. I love the size of this phone though I wish Samsung had at least made it the same size as the Galaxy S22 Ultra which is 6.9 inches, but however I can still work with 6.8 inches. I love the bigger screen phones because they are better for conducting business on the go and of course videos, movies and photography. Love the brightness of the screen and need I not mention the S Pen which I always wanted. Though it's true that this phone is pretty expensive, still, all in all it's worth every single penny for everything thing that has been put into it including hours of labor and time. I didn't want to upgrade my Galaxy S20 Plus this soon, but after seeing the moon zoom and the fact that this phone featured the popular S Pen, I have no other choice but to dive in, besides life is too short to not have the things we work hard for, so with that said I pampered myself to this device that I hope to have for many years to come. I seen in the reviews where someone stated that the phone will not charge past 85 percent. Go to settings, battery and device care followed by battery and then more battery setting and turn off the protect battery setting if you want your device to charge the entire 100 percent. However keep in mind that keeping this setting turned on increase the life of your battery when it only charges to 85 percent. Sound quality has also improved once again in this device and that is something that I love as well. I guess the even better part is the updates that is going to hopefully follow to put the icing on the cake because, as far as the hardware..... it's all there. Samsung has even stepped up their game and threw in McAfee on this one, so with that said, I stepped mine's up as well and bought the package deal from McAfee that will protect up to 10 devices. People, you ain't going to get better than this. This phone is super fast. I'm going to miss the memory card slot but just like the headphones port, I'll get over it quickly for all that this phone packs, I say so long memory card slot, welcome home Galaxy S23 Ultra.Update: 5/28/23.After having this phone longer, I've discovered more about it. The Bluetooth feature in this device is much faster than the one on my S20 Plus. My Galaxy Watch now connects instantly, where in my S20 Plus it took a few seconds to connect. I have been loving this phone so much that I have decided to replace the original plastic S Pen that came with it with the aluminum one to do my own part of keeping high-end products matched up with high-end products as I did with the case, going with the Otterbox Defender series pro case for this baby. I've heard people mention having dropped calls on Samsung phones, however I have not experienced that in this device this far into ownership. The photo of the Cellular Tower I took using the camera on this phone was taken from about a mile and some change away and I was zoomed to around 30mm out of 100, just to give you a better idea of what the camera on this device can do. I am very tickle with the benchmark results of this device, very, very beautiful results. Still waiting to see what it will do with a full moon not to mention the very popular ""Super Moon"". After using this phone for nearly two months now I still must say that it has been an amazing experience. I have also noticed where some are unfairly reviewing the phone, either you have a defective device or is not doing something right. The battery should be no less than 5 stars, and I personally would give it 10 stars if I could for being a perfect 10. I have gotten at least 4 days out of my phone off a single charge, I have also noticed where the fingerprint scanner got an unfair low rating, again if you use it right it will work right. Since setting this area of the phone up I have not once had any problems with the fingerprint scanner picking up my fingerprint, even when I have done it snappy it has never failed to work. So far on this device, I have not experienced any of the dropped calls that I hear about since the very moment I inserted my sim card into this phone. At last, I was able to take a few photos of the popular supermoon. Wasn't that clear of an evening here but I still must say that the camera on this phone did an awesome job capturing it at 230mm and around 7mp.","May 12, 2023"

Battery life seems to be about the same as what I had.  Lots to be said about this phone.Camera is pretty dang nice.  There are some strange 'glitches' when it transfers between lenses.  Even though this is Android and I have been using Android, there is a ton to learn to use the camera.Screen is very clean and nice.Finger print reader  with a screen protector is kind of hit and miss.  The detectors is behind the screen.  Not sure how they work that magic but its kind of cool.  Make sure you set your pin first.Reception.  This seems to be pretty good on t mobile.  I was able to just take my sim card from my old phone and insert it into this phone... no need to go to the store to transfer the account.  Copied the data from my old phone using a usb cable in 10ish minutes.  No problems there.All the critical apps seem to be working like before.  Some needed to be re-setup.  Had to reconnect to our WIFI networks.Very disappointed that you cannot use a micro-SD card.  Especially when you see the price difference to get something like 1T of storage.  Its a bit ridiculous to have a 200 M pixel camera and not allow for user supplied storage.  In fact, its really really lame.The weight and size of the camera takes a bit to get used to.  Its only like an inch longer and 1/3 inch wider, but wow what a difference that makes.The speaker(s) are really good.  There is kind of a spatial sound on this phone.The phone is pretty fast for everything I have done, processor wise.The s-pen its really cool...i have been using it as a remote trigger for the phone.The phone surface is pretty slick (as in a little slippery) so I highly recommend a  case.Magsafe is a cool feature.  There is a magnetic attachment point over the wireless charging.  With the right case, you can do several things with this, like attach a second battery with no wires, just by placing it behind the case.  You can add a kick-stand, wallet, etc.Customization is pretty solid on the phone.  Seems like you can customize pretty much anything.Blutooth pairing is pretty simple and have had no problems here.Overall, this is a good phone.  Plan on taking a week or so to explore all the different features.","June 16, 2023"

It uses the snapdragon 8 gen 2 which appears to work perfectly for demanding tasks such as hard-core gaming , multi tasking or even multi windows running simultaneously,  I personally haven't experienced 0 lags or stutters. It also dramatically is better in terms of managing heat and maintaining battery life compared to the s22 ultra!▪︎security is top tier !! It's secured by Samsung Knox, has a secured folder, fingerprint reader(in screen) and facial recognition (along with all the other standard security options) the fingerprint works perfectly no issues.▪︎self diagnose,  the phone can self diagnose and test to make sure all the services are working properly.▪︎ it's a Samsung! With Samsung it offers so many features, including free on-demand and live TV with over 100 channels, it has loads of unique features and services, a few examples are Bixby which is both an assistant and a tool for automated tasks, you also get loads of automation with the device for various tasks to help make your device more convenient.The battery on this and heat management is top tier, it's actually on Apples battery type level and that says something,  there's so much to unpack and I hope to be able to explore it all eventually. This phone is definitely not for the weak, it's specifically a high-end phone meant to be used to the fullest.Only con: it has a 10mp front facing camera.  The s22 ultra camera was so good all around that I only used snapchats camera and never the actual stock camera, now that it's 10mp and not 40mp, it's noticeably different.  I think this is a major down grade regardless if it's stock camera benefits from this.There's much more to mention but that's what came to mind, over all if you're looking for a premium phone and want a high-quality device , this phone definitely gets the job done by far with no issues, I'd highly advise a phone case as this phone is not cheap.Love it!","March 16, 2023"

For many many years my phone brand has always been LG. I have always found LG phones to be the best value for money. They pioneered features way before other brands; like tap to wake. They performed just as well as iPhone and Samsung but for much less money. But unfortunately LG left the smartphone market a couple of years ago and my LG V60 was finally showing it's age. I was finally forced to get something that wasn't LG for the first time in almost 2 decades. I was set and ready to get the one plus 11 and I had even purchased it and everything. The next day I discovered it had no water resistance rating nor wireless charging. One by itself wouldn't have been a deal breaker but lacking both features in tandem are unfortunately. Once I realized that, I cancelled my order for the One Plus. Normally I wouldn't consider Samsung, as they are just as expensive as Apple, but I did come across some really good deals on Prime day. I had considered the the 23 Ultra but was concerned about the overall size and I wouldn't use the stylus; so for me the price premium wasn't worth it. So I went for the 512GB 23+. I use my phone a lot during the day so I wanted a phone with plenty of storage and processing power. So far it's been working great; very speedy, feature rich, user friendly, and responsive. My cell reception seems to be better and it connects to all my devices well. My one gripe is the face recognition and fingerprint reader usually don't work the first time, which is annoying. I wish they would use a dedicated sensor and not an in-screen reader. Other than that the phone is a good choice and a good value considering I got a pretty good deal on it. So far, Samsung seems to be a good alternative to LG.","September 22, 2023"

This phone is great. The screen is large and very bright. The UI is snappy and the battery lasts all day. I average over 9 hours of screen on time. That is impressive given the size and brightness of the screen. Takes roughly an hour to charge from 10% to 100% using an Anker 45 watt fast charger.Was able to upgrade to Android 14/One UI 6 after initial setup. Smart Switch was able to transfer all my apps, messages and photos as well. It even transfered active logins for certain apps. Which was nice.Stereo speakers are nothing special. They sound exactly like the speakers from the cheap A series phones. Not really a big deal to me as they are perfectly fine for videos. The speakers are not very good for music so I use my Galaxy buds or a Bluetooth speaker.Lastly, the fingerprint scanner that others have complained about. It takes some getting used to. It's a bit frustrating initially but once you get the muscle memory down it unlocks I'd say about 98% of the time on the first attempt. Train as many prints as possible. It definitely helps. Also, turn on increased touch sensitivity in settings.This phone is definitely worth it. The flat screen is nice and the size is perfect. It definitely has some heft. Making it feel premium. Which can't be said of the A series of phones.If you are on the fence, just get it. You won't regret it.","November 27, 2023"

Hans,5.0,"I got this as an upgrade from my S20 fe. I had my hesitations but after using it for a couple of weeks, I can say that without a doubt, this was a worthy upgrade!I got it while it was discounted and opted in for the monthly payment plan, which is going smoothly. The sound quality is far superior to that of my other phone but what I really like are how much more capable this phone is, from it's S Pen to the photo editing features, and the high capacity RAM, which allows me to use several apps at once without having them close on me after much inactivity or lag on me.It also has so many more features that can be tweaked in the settings and I love how you can change the sizing format of the homescreen to fit more apps there. There's so much that can be done and used that I guarantee you'll need to watch a couple of YouTube videos to see the full breadth of what this thing can do.And the camera is better than any phone camera I've used. The zoom is sick. You can tweak the settings in it to get the capture quality you like. The battery life is also far better and out performs the S20 fe. You can use the battery saver features to stretch its life after each charge.If there's a downside, I'd say that finding a screen protector that will work with it and allow you to use the fingerprint unlock function at the same time, will be tricky. It took me 4 purchases to find a decent screen protector that doesn't feel like thick plastic and doesn't pop right off because of the curved screen. Even once I found a functional one that felt good, it occasionally gives me issues with fingerprint unlock.In short, the pros far outweigh any cons. This phone for me is the best on the market as of this date. It doesn't have me missing my S20 fe one bit!","October 13, 2023"

Hans,5.0,"I work in I.T. support and see too many issues with Apple products. I have had Samsung phones since around 2014. I have an S5, an S7 and S9. The S5 & S7 are retired now but still work. The S9 is still active on another line. All these have had ""normal"" lives, dropped now and then, survived spills and weather. It only made sense to move to the S23 series and I got this Ultra model mainly for the large screen to help with my old shaky hands. I used the Smart Switch app to move files from the S9 to this phone and it saved a ton of time. There are many manual things that need to be done to complete the switch but this worked well. This phone is awesome. The cameras are better than most of my stand alone digital cameras. The phone itself has great clarity and the cell and WiFi connections are very stable. 5G speeds are awesome but I normally don't play games or watch much video with this phone. All but a couple apps still work that transferred from the S9. A feature that I miss is the standard audio jack for headphones. Battery life on this phone is better than the S9, the wireless charging stations I already have work great and the display size is a major improvement for me and my clumsy hands.

"SAMSUNG Galaxy S23 Ultra Series AI Phone, Unlocked Android Smartphone, 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM, 200MP Camera, Night Mode, Long Battery Life, S Pen, US Version, 2023, Phantom Black",Ryan,5.0,"I bought a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra U. S. Version unlocked and brand new at the significantly reduced price of $969 when it originally sold for $1200.00.  The current top of the line Samsung phone is the S24 Ultra, but there are minimal differences between the S23 Ultra and the S24 Ultra and the $969 that I paid is $330 less than the $1299 price of a new S24 Ultra.  Even with some S24 Ultras selling on sale for $1149, I still saved $180.  Here are some of the minimal differences between the S23 Ultra and the S24 Ultra.  1-The S24 Ultra has AI capability, but it will be coming in software updates to the S23 Ultra and Samsung plans to start charging for it in the future anyway so It's no big deal.  2-For the S24 Ultra, Samsung dispensed with the curved edges of the display found on the S23 Ultra, leaving a flat front (Samsung claims it has 47% less bezel on the sides). That new screen is also brighter with a maximum of 2,600 nits (the S23 Ultra maxed out at 1,750 nits) and thus easier to see in bright daylight. The S24 Ultra's screen is also made of Corning's newest and toughest material, Gorilla Glass Armor, while the S23 has Corning's Gorilla Glass Victus 2.  3-As for cameras, the S24 Ultra inherits most of its predecessor's lenses and sensors but does use a 50-megapixel 5x optical telephoto camera in place of the 10-megapixel 10x optical camera in the S23 Ultra. While the new camera has a shorter optical length, its higher megapixel count should mean photos taken with it are sharper than those shot with the S23's 10x optical camera.  To get to 10x optical length, the S24 Ultra shoots with its 5x optical camera and crop zooms in.  4-The S24 Ultra is powered by a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, which is faster than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 in the S23 Ultra. Configurations have also been simplified in the new premium phone: you can only get 12GB of RAM and 256GB, 512GB or 1TB of storage (no 8GB RAM option, as there was in the S23 Ultra). The rest of the hardware remains relatively unchanged, although the S24 Ultra should get a minor battery efficiency boost thanks to its newer chipset.  5-Samsung expanded how long it's pledging to support its newest phones. The S24 Ultra comes with Android 14 and will get seven years of Android software and security patches, up from four years in the S23 Ultra (which comes with Android 13). For sustainability, the S24 Ultra has more recycled parts, including cobalt in its battery and rare earth elements in its speakers.  I took all of these minor differences into account and I felt that they weren't worth the $330 difference.  I will look for similar deals on new models that were just replaced with newer models in the future.  I would also advise anyone buying any new cellphone to buy an unlocked U. S. model so you aren't tied to any one cellphone carrier while you are paying off the phone.","April 14, 2024"

Replacement arrived, screens felt slightly different. Placed carefully in pocket every time, and checked the phone after each withdrawal. For the first few times all seemed well; however, a few micro and I mean micro scratches appeared. You can't see them in standard light but if you look at it like a crazy person like I did (after the first phone's issues) you can see them. There is no way this phone would last a long time on it's own. Either samsung has some really bad quality control or I have to say the new glass is definitely a flop. I gave a family member my old s21 ultra already but I kind of wishing I had it as I really dislike the screen protector feel, but I don't think you can safely own this phone without one (or get lucky with quality control).The phone's battery has been fantastic though, much more efficient power wise. The photos are naturally very good as well (not that s21's were bad though). The phone is slim, the pen is nice (I used a phone case with a pen attached to it for my old 21 so I was excited to get it internal). The phone seems to process things quite quickly and things look as good and as smooth as you'd expect for the price (good).The material that seemed to cause the scratch was a synthetic like material that lined the pocket on some icebreaker shorts (merino wool company). Both my s21 ultras have been stored in this pocket before (which I've owned for multiple years). The previous phone I'm not sure which material caused it but it had many scratches that were visible from different angles. I don't wear blue jeans which have those metal buttons, I only wear slacks, cotton, and merino. I don't work in a sand pit either, so whatever scratched these phones was simply in the pocket out of the pocket (was never dropped). I even have my Note 10s, zero scratches.There is definitely something disappointing with their new glass. I've read some people say its because it's more shatter resistant so it's softer.. so I suppose if you're a phone dropper that might be good news, but I've never dropped my phone.. I'd rather be able to enjoy the premium screen feel with a scratch free screen.One note is the s21 ultra screens feel MUCH harder / smoother than the s23 ultra, which has a sort of soft squish and very very slight resistance.Amazon's customer service has been great and I would recommend buying phones from them- whichever phone you choose.If you were fine with your battery and camera, didn't need an upgrade, and had a sturdy phone then I'm not sure I'd suggest buying this as it's very expensive yet fairly fragile phone as it defeat's it's own luxury feel by requiring a screen protector (or luck of QC).If you're a screen protector free type person, then I don't recommend the phone, unless you're also into some gambling in which case buy the phone from Amazon so you can at least potentially replace it without a nightmare.Working with samsung on this is just an exercise in pain, though if they turn around somehow I'll update the review again.Previous Update: 3 stars- After talking to support for a third time they suggested to have Amazon replace it so I'm not out of a phone (and it's under the 15 day warranty). Amazon customer service was very quick and easy. Will update again for better or worse. Old review below.Old review 1 Star:Phone screen scratches easily, like put in and take our of your pocket. I've had a s21 ultra for multiple years and the screen looks brand new- not a single scratch at /any/ angle of light, there is no screen protector. The s23 ultra after a few /days/ has multiple micro abrasions that you can see at certain angles (like tiny scratches). I'm not one to put the phone in the same pocket as keys or just toss it in the bag either. Potentially a manufacturing defect, but Samsung support has been bad. Couldn't make a service request through their members system so I contacted chat who made it for me, arrived at the center they told me to go, they said they can't do anything for me because they don't have the screen and even if they did they wouldn't help because it's common scratching (... No way that is true, unless the glass is worse than s21..??).It's certainly a fast phone and the pen is neat, the functionality of the phone is great, I assume it's a good batch bad batch thing. Otherwise If the screen is actually weaker then the older phone then.. don't upgrade. If you're lucky it's probably great. :/","February 28, 2023"

However, I did seriously consider switching right before getting this S23 Ultra. Heres why I ultimattely  went with Samsung this time.I have stuck with android, and used many over the years. Droid Razr, Nexus6P, Pixel2, Xperia I 3.  I am familiar with  and like the useability of android. Just how it is. MAIN USE: It was important to me I get a phone that can meet my goals of retaining media. I was able to move all my music files and photos collections rather easily to the S23. About 2400 songs, and favorite pics and videos from all my phones. It would have likely been a nightmare if I switched to iphone. Something about needing itunes or whatever, on a PC. No thanks. And i use a 3rd party music app and bam, phone is my main music collection.In my research, and knowing full well, Samsung is the android leader that Pixel wants to be. I have no illwill toward them, just acknowledging Google desperately trying to catch  up. Samsung has the specs, the hardware, and top camera above all. They have the brand too stand behind as well.CAMERA: I love how great the camera works. It really shines when outdoors is good lighting. Videos come out crystal clear.  I know some of my iphone friends may have taken a doubletake at the quality when seeing for themseelves. Has slowmo, superslow mo, wide angle, zoom, you name it. SHots still come out great even zoomed. Not blurry like my previous phones with a zoom lens.BATTERY: S23 is fast charging when using the right cable and plugin charger, otherwise slow trickles if using a ""slow"" one. Battery seems to last me 2 days, but I do not use my phone 24/7 on super brightness. It would last longer if I didnt use it at all during work, but I tend to play music so of course.SCREEN: Its a nice big display alright. Not 100% sure, but i think bigger than newest big ihpone?  Nice and bright and clear. Phone is fast, and works well.THE BAD: Here re my legit criticisms of this phone. NO headphone jack. I know its old tech, but having nice wired phones be relegated to pc use is meh. No SD card slot.  As media focused as I am, I hate that sd card slots have been phased out. BRING THE SD CARD SLOT BACK.OVERALL: This S23 Is a great phone. Despite the industry ditching sd cards and headphone jacks. IMO, likely the best android  brand today. Pixel would likely be the close 2nd place. This S23 is frequently on sale due to the next Galaxies coming out, and is ultimately still cheaper than comparable iphone equivalents. If you want top of the line, its this.","November 12, 2023"
"SAMSUNG Galaxy S23 Ultra Series AI Phone, Unlocked Android Smartphone, 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM, 200MP Camera, Night Mode, Long Battery Life, S Pen, US Version, 2023, Phantom Black",BBwu,3.0,"I've had this phone a day so I obviously haven't had it long enough to give a full, educated review of it. I'm writing this review because I will most likely be returning it.First off, I'm coming from an iPhone SE and you could easily hide that phone inside this one. I knew it was big, but this might be too big.Coming from iPhone where everything is intuitive, I am struggling to do even basic stuff on this phone like see the weather without having to just look it up in a browser. A lot of this stuff is to be expected and I don't knock off points for not knowing the UI. It just feels like it could be a little easier for new Android users to figure things out. The absence of a home button will take a lot of getting used to.The fingerprint scanner works great. So great that I had my wife try to open my phone using her print, which it didn't work. It's just sometimes I can barely touch the scanner and it will open. I think this is great. I haven't set up face recognition as it's a feature I just can't see messing with.I thought that it being an Android phone, using Google apps would be seamless. But I'm having to log into each Gmail account and re-log any time I log out, even though on the computer, I'm logged into all of my Google accounts and can switch between them easily. Same with YouTube. So far, this phone is acting like it's day one every time I want to switch to another account.Battery life has been good so far. It had 50% when it arrived and it's down to 42% after almost 24 hours. But battery life on all new phones is miraculous, though. A year from now, it will struggle to make it 4 hours of heavy use without needed topped up. But topping up isn't something Samsung thought about as you don't even get a charger included. I won't be able to charge this phone until my I order or go buy a charger. I didn't see this when I bought it, so I'm to blame for that ignorance, but when I read it was to cut down on e-waste, I knew that was a load of bull. It's the same reason my wife's Kia didn't come with a spare tire: everything is a-la-cart these days. My old device, packaging, charger and phone case are now waste, but you're concerned about ONLY the charger? I can't reuse my charger. Because Apple has to be a special snowflake and use lightning. Which they are doing away with I believe, so I would have had to buy a new charger even with Apple because everyone is moving to this new format of giving you most of the things you need, but not everything.The phone is good I guess. It looks amazing. You set the resolution between 720, 1080, or 1440 to save on battery. It's snappy and fast. Calls are clear but I was on Wi-Fi at the time so who knows what it sounds like out in the wild. Plenty of customization options ofc. I like that it has a reboot option instead of power off only like the SE had. The problem is, unless I'm doing it wrong, the button combo to power it down, is the same as taking a screenshot. I've taken quite a few needless screenshots while trying to master the timing to get to the power down/reboot option to pop up. Supposedly you can take screenshots by waving your palm across the face, but even after enabling this feature (which is off by default and in your s-pen settings), I haven't been able to make it work even once.I'd say this phone is powerful enough for desktop gaming and probably has a lot of content available for it, but this charger thing that everyone is moving to needs to be pushed back against.Having customers buy a charger from a 3rd party doesn't cut down on waste, it just fattens their profit margin.","September 27, 2023"

Or perhaps lots of other reasons too, but hot dang, the camera though.  I'd say as a professional DSLR photographer that this is as close as it gets to having pro capabilities on a phone, but that it's still not quite there yet.  On a DSLR you've got quite a big dynamic range of light and dark and color and everything in between that gets snapped with a photo, whereas on this phone it's probably cut in half... but it's still the best dang thing we've got in the form of a phone.  I find myself actually snapping more phone pics than Nikon DSLR pics these days honestly, since I bought this thing.Otherwise?  Processing power is bar-none speedy as.  Far better than the iPhones I've been toting everywhere for years.  Interface is easy to figure out, even if you're indoctrinated to the Apple world.  Storage space is big (on the 512GB), and I back up on MS OneDrive, so it's no biggie anyway.  Lots of apps to choose from since Android is kinda like how Windows is to OSX in terms of what's available to you.  Screen is a monster which is awesome for visibility and workability, but is still just fine in a standard pocket and doesn't feel cumbersome.  Wi-fi adapter is snappy.  S-Pen is super cool!  Audio is bomber.I suppose my only complaints are:(1) that the 'adaptive brightness' mode is obnoxious in that it does work well to alter screen brightness per lighting situation but it sucks that the brightest the phone can get is only available in that particular mode... so if you're in changing lighting situations and you're annoyed that it won't just be bright all the time, deal with it.  This is the pits with certain photography situations when under shadowfall.(2) The phone wants to automatically send text messages via RCS or whatever which is wi-fi only and so sometimes if you or the recipient is not on wi-fi at the moment the text fails to send.  Sometimes you have no idea when this has happened until later when you see a note that 'message has failed to send.' Ugh.  You can however set options in text threads to 'SMS only' which is via 4G only.(3) This isn't really an issue with the product so much as an issue with current tech, but a sort of 'buyer beware' notice: the aperture on these phone cameras is so shallow that it compares like a candle to the sun in terms of all around image focus per phone to DSLR quality.  I will say I am tremendously impressed with how far phone cameras have come, but that it is still wounding that phones can't overcome this obstacle.Anyway, buy this thing.  You will NOT regret buying this thing.  That is all.","August 20, 2023"

I got this to replace my old S21 cell phone. For the most part, I like Samsung Galaxy devices do to the louder external speaker over other devices like iPhones.But anyway when I got this phone; The button layout are in the same arangement as my old phone. For me, that was a plus. The external speaker running the Same TTS along with Talkback doesn't seem to be as clear to me. It sounds like it is a little muffeled and a little lower in volume even with the same settings as my S21 like when in a pocket.When charging the phone; The charging spead doesn't look to be much improved. You would think going from an 25W (S21) to and 45W (S23 plus) you would see a large difference on charging time. But looks to be only about 15 minutes or so difference. Yes a totally blind person needs to have the phone on to know how the phone is doing as far as charging otherwise the screen reader will not work. I do like the faster charging being I don't have to wait as long even that it is only 15 or so minutes faster. But again, this is an larger battery. Speaking of the battery! I get about 2 days and more on a charge. The old phone I was getting about 1.5 days. I mainly use my phone to make and  receive calls. I keep the screen off being a totally blind person doesn't need that function on to suck power. But running the external speaker takes as much power to run as the screen does! lol.As far as turning on the phone to me seams to take as long as the old S21 to startup. This phone does work on AT&T network even on 5G. The bad thing is you cannot lock it to 5G only! But I'm guessing that this is do to Samsung and AT&T having an agreement that the phone must be set to Auto and the user cannot control that. Same goes if you are having trouble with cell signal quality and you want to use Wi-Fi calling! As long as you have an cell signal coverage! Wi-Fi calling will not work. Again AT&T not wanting  people to use that as long as you are on there network. Other devices like Apples; Allow you to do that being they told AT&T you aren't going to do that.","August 18, 2023"

Hay varias cosas que no me han terminado de agradar a la hora de cambiarme de telefono.Cosas que me gustaron:1. LA CAMARA. Totalmente increible. Soy mucho de tomarle fotos a las estrellas, luna, paisajes e insectos. Realmente valio la pena comprarlo por esto.2. Al jugar juegos que incluso son muy exigentes, no se calienta para nada3. La pantalla. No se como describirlo, pero tiene mucha nitidez, aunque no es muy brillosa. Ademas, como pro y contra, es demasiado demasiado lisa, es comodo usarlo, pero resbala, lo cual en ciertos juegos puede perjudicarCosas que me disgustaron:1. La huella dactilar esta en la pantalla frontal, mientras que en el OP5T esta en la parte de atras, con una cavidad. A la hora de usar la huella, cuesta encontrar correctamente donde poner el dedo, teniendo que realizar varios intentos antes de acertarle, mientras que en el OP5T al tener la cavidad, facilmente podias sentir que estabas colocando bien el dedo.2. El reconocimiento facial demora bastante a comparacion del OP5T y lo peor es que al dia de hoy, una vez reconocido no hay modo de quitar la pantalla de bloqueado, entonces debes esperar a que te reconozca y hacer swipe para desbloquear si usas este metodo3. El celular pesa muchisimo, un poco menos del doble que el OP5T, hasta cierto punto es cansado sostenerlo.4. No trae cargador, solamente cable USB C a USB C y esto fue un dolor de cabeza para mi porque tuve que incurrir a un gasto extra ya que no tengo ningun cargador de USB C5. El sonido es relativamente bajo6. Por el precio, hubiera sido bueno agregarle un protector y/o un case7. Para tomar screenshots es un poco complicado. Mientras que en el OP5T tenia el boton de apagado en un lado y el de volumen en el otro lado, estos estan del mismo lado, lo cual se me hace un poco incomodo de presionar para tomar screenshot. Y si es usando gesto, debes pasar todo la palma, lo cual tampoco se me hace practico. En OP5T puedes deslizar tres dedos de arriba hacia abajo para tomar screenshot.","September 1, 2023"

But I do have to preface this review by saying that I am updating from  an LG G4 that I got for free from Verizon in 2016, so this is a complete upgrade for me from a practically useless phone versus people moving from a more recent model.This phone is HUGE. I am somewhat regretting not paying closer attention to the dimensions and opting for one of the lesser s23 models, but I know I’ll get used to it after a month or so. New phones are always an adjustment.I was able to set up my phone through Verizon but was unable to do it with the eSIM and had to head to a store to get a physical sim. So be aware if you plan on taking advantage of the eSIM. It might not be as easy as they make it seem.I do NOT use facial recognition or fingerprint scan so I can’t speak to those.The display is beautiful and covers the entire surface of the phone vs. others that have black bands on top and bottom.I’m not a huge app user so I have minimal screen time but the last time I charged my phone was 72 hours ago and I am still at 54% so the battery life is wildly impressive to me so far.Was kind of annoyed that the phone only comes with a cord and no wall outlet, especially since both ends of the cord is USBC so your old usb to wall adapter may not be enough. I expected this though and ordered a Samsung OEM charger. It cost me 40$ but after buying a thousand dollar phone that seemed like spare change so I happily shelled out the money.Beware of screen protectors!! I spent 60$ on three different kinds of screen protectors before I found one that fit and actually stayed attached. The curved glass screen makes this a difficult fit but I’d rather not use it without one. Make sure you are careful about what you buy and really read reviews, especially the bad ones. Don’t be fooled by brands that offer incentive for good reviews to hide the negative ones.The amount of cameras seems a bit excessive but I look forward to trying them. The zoom, I can tell, is already incredible and I can’t wait for a clear night to get some good shots.Overall I’m VERY happy with this switch.I did buy the phone during a promotion and got higher memory at a lower price with an additional 100$ off so I did pay 300 less than manufacturer’s price.","February 23, 2023"

When I finally decided to make the purchase I wanted to get the ultra, however my friend reminded me that I'm not a lucky person when it comes to phone,  as I'm always losing my phones or dropping them and damaging the screens. So I purchase the S23 instead. Can't say I regretted it. I have been using this phone since September and I have no issue with it. Battery last me up to two days ,when I'm not actively using the Bluetooth functions. Picture quality is awesome. The size fits right inside my purses and the features are great. If you're looking for something that has 99% of the features of the ultra at an economical price then this is the phone for you. And if you're like me that love gadgets but won't use more than 60% of the features on them then this is definitely the phone for you. And if you're someone that will utilize all the features on your phone this is still the phone for you.  If you're a content creator and looking for a good phone to use, you can't go wrong with this one. Compare with a 14pro I would choose the S23 over and over.","March 11, 2024"
"SAMSUNG Galaxy S23 Ultra Series AI Phone, Unlocked Android Smartphone, 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM, 200MP Camera, Night Mode, Long Battery Life, S Pen, US Version, 2023, Phantom Black",Audrey B,2.0,"This was unfortunately a regrettable purchase, but I was thankful that I bought it through Amazon because the return process was smooth, as has been my experience with most unsatisfactory products purchased through Amazon.First and foremost, I'm an iOS user of 10 or so years, but have experimented with usage of Android on multiple occasions (once with a Note 9, another time with a Note 20 Ultra, and just recently with the S23 Ultra). I have no issue with admitting that Android triumphs in certain areas where iOS is very lackluster, but also feel the same way in reverse in thinking that iOS wins over Android in many areas as well. I suppose if I had been an Android user all along, these issues would be minute because I would be accustomed to them. So, I will give a few reasons why I have come to the conclusion that the S23U was not for me and why I switched back to iOS (and went with an iPhone 14 Pro Max):- My biggest gripe was the battery life. I chock up many of the positive reviews (both here on Amazon and on other websites containing reviews that I used to influence me to buy the S23U in the first place) to not knowing any better, and potentially being lifelong Android users. Within a couple of minutes of removing the S23U from the charger, battery life began dropping. This is after extensive viewing of YouTube (or Google) tutorials for advice on what settings would best be used to preserve the battery life and make it last longer. Every potential setting that could be altered to make battery life more satisfactory on this phone was applied, but to no avail. I am your average social media doom-scroller and will snap a photo here and there, but never had any intention of heavily using this phone for, say, classroom note taking or anything similar. So, when I took the phone to work for a 4-hour shift and it was down to half its battery life by the time I left, even though I'd hardly touched it other than maybe throwing on a music playlist, it was a pretty big blow. Throughout the time I had this phone I was mortified at the thought of getting into an accident with this thing on hand in the event that the battery died on me, but just didn't really feel like I should I have to prioritize the idea of carrying a spare phone charger around with me at all times. With an iPhone and its already built in settings, I could take it off of the charger, doom-scroll for an hour and would *maybe* lose 1-2% battery life in that time.- Secondly, I had a heck of a time with notifications and particularly, text messages on the S23U. There were multiple instances where I would miss text messages because the phone never once notified me that someone had texted me. Again, I took to Google and found out that an additional app (Glimpse Notifications) can be downloaded to remedy this issue, and it luckily did, or that I am aware of. No one should have to download an app (also using up unnecessary space on their phone) in order to ensure they receive something as simple as text messages and see them on their lock screen.- Your average joe-schmo photos came out incredibly beautiful....that is, so long as using the zoom function was not imperative to whatever you were photographing. Even 3x zoom proved a massive disappointment as whatever you were taking a photo of was incredibly grainy and blurry. I have a friend who is a lifelong Android user (who also told me I would never want to go back to iPhone and would be incredibly satisfied with the S23U) whom I sent sample screenshots to, and he was shocked at how disappointing the photos were. Like I said, if you're just taking the average photo of something close up to you, it's a very pleasing sight, but if you're trying to take picture of an animal around 12 or so feet away and need a little bit of zooming...prepare for disappointment.Facial recognition was testy, to say the least. It didn't recognize my face half the time (even though I reset it, then set it back up again anew), so I just got fed up and decided to do away with it and go with the fingerprint scanner.All in all, I spent the majority of my time owning this phone navigating the settings menus or downloading apps to try and get basic functions to operate correctly. There was little enjoyment from it. For the money that I spent, it just wasn't worth it to me, personally.","May 4, 2023"

For its price and quality. Its my 2nd android phone, last being Samsung note 3, and this phone is really good in all aspects. I haven't dealt any issue with it like running apps or any crashes. Everything runs smoothly and camera quality is excellent, even better than Apple phones.It was really a nice change from the apple series and getting this android was a test to compare my apple phone. They are different but android provides more features than iphone does in my opinion. However the only thing the face recognition is not that great on the samsung, compared to phones that's quick. However I do like the fingerprint, and miss that feature on iphones.For apple users, I say this is a pretty good phone. But like me who has apple watch, ipad pro, laptop, air pods, etc~ I say if you have all those, stick with apple phones since their compatible with one another. But if you don't have all those and you want to change up, go for s23.Lastly, go for s23 then s24, if you're unsure as an apple user, s23 is still good and cheaper. There isn't much difference between them other than design and their Ai features, that s23 ( and other phone that are compatible too for the update) will get later on.Ps I'm only saying this to Apple users who want to change from apple to android^","February 18, 2024"

Samsung doesnt offer a 128gb version on the ultra, which is bogus in my opinion. Amazon prime offered same day shipping, which was nice. Phone arrived intact and fine. No problems with shipping.The build quality of the S23 Ultra is very solid and feels good in the hands. The matte finish on the back is very nice and smooth, leaves no fingerprints. The screen feels really good and smooth. The s pen is nice to have, but I find that I dont use it that much. Its nice when taking photos you can set up the phone and press the s pen button to take the photo when youre ready. Speaking of the camera, the photos are excellent quality. This phone is equipped with a 200mp camera, which takes some very detailed and clear photos. I would say this phone has the best camera compared to every other phone. This phone is equipped with a 5000 mah battery, which lasts the whole day. The fingerprint sensor works 98% of the time, when my hand is very dry it doesnt work as well. I havent tested facial recognition yet so I cant speak on that. The screen is 120 hz, and looks and feels very smooth.The android skin this phone uses, OneUI, is one of the better android skins on the market. The customization of this phone is way better than IOS in my opinion, you can do so much more. One thing I dislike about the os is that after every time i swipe up to exit an app, the samsung quick access wallet app pops up in place of the spot where I use to swipe to exit apps. I find this very annoying and I'm not sure where to disable it. One other thing I dislike is this phone requires you to have two different accounts with Google and Samsung, whereas with iPhone, all you need is an icloud account.Screen protectors are hard to put on this phone because of the curved edges, so be mindful of that.Overall, this is a VERY solid flagship device, if youre in the market for a new cell phone, this is the phone to buy.","August 9, 2023"

My job provided S-series phones to me for the past 10 years.  They were always a couple of generations behind but they worked fine.  I just retired in June and decided to get a cheaper Android phone to replace my company S10 which had been working perfectly.  I purchased a Motorola Stylus 5G and it's been a nightmare.  I live in a dead zone for cell signal so I need wifi calling and the Motorola kept dropping network connection.  Even though it was using wifi for all my apps just fine I often wasn't getting calls or texts.  And when I would go back to a good cell signal it wouldn't automatically connect again unless I restarted the phone.  I found myself doing restarts one or two times a day to get network and if I didn't I would miss calls or texts from people who said they couldn't get a hold of me.  I remembered this happening once before when my job gave me a mid grade A50 and it was so bad I had to return it and ask for another S series.  So lesson for me is just get a flagship...even if it's an older generation it's still going to work and age better than a mid grade.  That said, I really like the S23+.  I doesn't lose network,  works flawlessly, is a perfect size and is easy to set up.  Hopefully it ages as well as my S10 did.  I could probably still be using that if I had it.  I do miss having SD card options but there is enough memory to house my entire music collection without making a huge dent in the memory and higher end phones are discontinuing SD cards for a reason.  I got this phone 20% of retail so if you wait you can save some money.  I wish I never spent on the motorola in the first place.  Budget phones might be fine if you live in a good area with great reception, but for me the two I've tried were nothing but a waste and a pain.  This 23+ however, is a great phone.","August 16, 2023"

I'm not really into huge phones so I got the smallest size - which was the Samsung S23. After having this phone for several months, I got some strong opinionsFirst, this device has really good camera quality for most people. There is often this superstition that android phones have bad camera quality, but for my daily use this is perfect. Sometimes the camera has a hard time focusing on objects up close, and may have a slight shutter lag when taking pictures, but these are concerns which only matter to photographers. The phone camera also comes with 8k 30fps, which isn't needed for most people, but it exists in case you need to knowSecond, the fingerprint sensor is mid. I had a hard time with the fingerprint sensor (may have been because of my screen protector), but I found ways to overcome the difficulty. The first thing I did was re-register my fingerprint when the screen protector was on, and record several instances of my finger. The sensor, despite being ultrasonic, may take a while to recognize the fingerprint. It may also get some time before you get used to the sensor, as it may take a while the first couple of weeks.Lastly, the display is AMAZING. Having upgraded from a 2 year device, I thought the display would only be a slight improvement. But no, it comes with 60-120hz display and I have seen almost zero lag when watching videos or playing games. (Btw this phone plays high performance games like genshin impact like a boss).This is easily a phone which I would give a 10/10.

Although zooming in ultra close on a picture still has some jpeg compression artifacts, the overall image quality is great. It also has a raw mode which allows storage of picture files without compression.The other visual features are also impressive, video mode allows you to shoot in a variety of resolutions and frame rates, including up to 8k.Sound quality is impressive for a panel phone, and when watching videos with stereo audio information, the sound is actually reproduced by two speakers, one at the bottom, and the earpiece speaker, which adds more engagement when watching music or other videos.The phone sound quality is great, and is significantly better than most of the other phones I have used in the past.I have had a few minor issues with the face recognition, although if I add more variations (with sunglasses, or hats, etc.) I will probably have fewer issues. The display embedded fingerprint scanner is taking a little getting used to, but maybe re-registering the finger prints may help reduce those issues. The fact that fi get print scanning is possible on the display screen (as opposed to a dedicated scanner on the ba k or side of the phone) is another interesting feature, and is raki g me a little bit to get used to.I have only had older, reconditioned or renewed phones in the past, and have always been at least two to three years  behind the latest technology when purchasing a new phone. My last phone was at least 5 to 6 years since it was released. This is my first brand new, flagship phone, and although a bit pricey (for being an early adopter) I am pleased with the overall performance and features of the device. I am still learning about it, and finding new, neat little features that are not always a big selling point, but add to the 'wow' factor.I am very pleased with this device, and have protected it with an OtterBox defender case and a gel type screen protector, and in the month I have had it, I have enjoyed every aspect of it.","April 9, 2023"

One nice feature of this phone is that you can set an upper limit for charging, which supposedly protects the battery. Mine is currently set to stop charging at 85%.My biggest complaint about switching to this phone is the limitations for transferring apps. First of all, the transfer process takes a very, very long time, and none of the login information or passwords transfers, so you have to log into each app and, in some cases, go through a few additional steps. In this regard, I have to admit that Apple is the best company out there: you can transfer from one phone to another and immediately have the new phone do everything the old phone did without any glitches.I would also say that the phone is too expensive. It would be a bargain at half the price. Again, the only reason I bought it was that my S8 couldn't make it through the day anymore. Otherwise, I don't think the features of this phone are in any way superior.","September 16, 2023"

My best one ever. Color, screen resolution, more features than ever. Hope I get another six to seven years of enjoyment as I did with my S9+. There are two discrepancies that I noticed right away: The phone unlike the past comes with no charger. Can't believe they would not provide one for the price we're paying. Secondly the very first direction is to remove the sim card. I could not get the tray to open so a hasty call to my provider saved the day when they provided a digital SIM. I love this phone and do not want to go through a terrible Christmas return. A You Tube video shows a couple tricks to get it open so I will leave it alone and enjoy my new phone. Might I suggest that Samsung check this feature when packing these phones. With all said this is a beautiful and exciting new phone and I'm looking forward to years of enjoying it.","December 7, 2023"

Yes, I use it a lot during the day for emails, messages, etc. but still...Camera is ok, not as terrific as the reviews made it seem. I bought this because my old S21 that we'd bought through our service provider was losing its charge too quickly, and the camera on the S23+ got really good reviews. The camera is pretty good, but for me... While cell phone cameras have come a long way and they are very handy to have, I still don't think anything beats a good Canon or Nikon digital.At least this one didn't cost as much I paid Spectrum for the S21 I bought through them.

I held off for as long as I could. There are great things about this phone. I could grade this phone on a curve and give it 4 or 5 stars. But in truth, not having a headphone jack is inexcusable -- we all seemingly just accept it because most every other high-end phone (all?) with the promise of software updates for at least a few years is doing the same. Because of the lack of headphone jack, I had to fiddle with several USB-C to 3.5mm dongles. The first resulted in audio cutting in after every half-second of silence. Unusable. I then purchased an Anker one that did the job. I should not have spent time on this -- the phone should be making my life simpler, not harder. Bluetooth headphones are fine, but they need to be charged from time to time, and the minimum volume I can get on my BT headphones still seem far too loud -- do better if you are making us use this standard! Now, when I use my USB-C to Audio dongle, it seems my phone is draining much faster than my previous phone, and the phone does not charge as quickly.What I don't like about this phone:(1) No headphone jack resulting in a bunch of BS, like having to search for a dongle that works, the phone not charging as quickly while listening to music, depleting battery more quickly.(2) The placement of the volume rocker buttons and the power button is a more awkward design than the S8, making screenshots more difficult to take.(3) The fingerprint sensor is okay -- but I miss the placement on the S8, where you got a better intuition (especially with a case) for where to put your finger. I'm aware the S8's fingerprint reader was heavily criticized at the time, but it was great placement.(4) No more SD card slot. Which is why I had to go for the 256gb model. Great.(5) I should be allowed to uninstall apps I don't want that come with the phone. This goes for both Google and Samsung apps.What I like:(1) Battery is vastly better than the S8. I love the battery maintenance mode that limits the charge to 85%.(2) Extremely fast browsing and installing/updating apps.(3) Good camera from what I can tell.(4) Good promise of software and security updates, and Samsung now has a good track record on this.(5) Great build quality as far as I can tell.(6) Transfer from S8 to S23 was relatively straightforward using Samsung SmartSwitch. But you will have to do WhatsApp manually. iPhones do not have this issue.","September 10, 2023"

What's new?  Out of the past smartphones I h ave owned which were mostly Samsung, this one is no worse and not all that much better.  I have never had a lot of success with either of the features having to do with security.  I have redone my face about 20 times and it's hit and miss.  As to fingerprint, about the same.  So if neither works from the start I simple enter in the 4 digit pin.  No big deal. As to battery life, I find it improved over the previous Galaxy S10e I was using.  I am not disappointed in my purchase and firmly believe others reading the reviews, don't let the 1 and 2 star reviews guide you.

Previously having owned the S22 Ultra, which was also spectacular, I couldn't be more pleased with this model.If you've never had an ultra model, you need to grab this.If you're coming from another ultra, the upgrades are noticeable, but not revolutionary. While the front camera technically dropped MP from the 22, the actual sensor and software prove it to actually outperform it.You really can feel the power behind the device when switching between various memory intensive apps. It stays quick and snappy, never taking a moment to breathe or needing to catch up.I personally go into dev options and turn up the animation speeds. I also grabbed the nova launcher to really take advantage of just how much real estate you have on this screen size, but the stock launcher is definitely past acceptable!The S pen is used every single day for so many different little things, the least of which is drawing.I could go on about how much I'm in love with this thing, but that doesn't really impress upon you just how good it really is.

I've only had it for a couple weeks and I could gush about it much more than anyone would read, but its a great phone. Great hardware, great software. I'm still getting used to how big it is, I actually prefer smaller phones but I figured I'd give this a try. It has a lot of great features and good software design though that compensate for the size and make it still one hand useable. The pen is fun too.This phone has so many features I've watched dozens of those ""50 things you didn't know you could do with the S23 Ultra"" type YouTube videos and am still learning new things. Its still super user friendly, you can pick it up and do all the things you'd expect a smartphone to do no problem, but then you can also get really into it and discover a ton of awesome extra features it has to play with.Fit and finish is nice too, I got the green and I wish it was more green and less grey, but it still looks and feels nice. Very premium feel with the nice glass, metal sides, and whatever material the back is, I don't even know.Seamless integration with both Samsung and third party peripherals like headphones, watches, etc. I think Samsung is catching up to Apple in terms of its ecosystem integration, plus unlike apple it works just as well with third party and other android devices as it does other Samsung devices.Awesome phone, I'll have this one a long time I think","August 5, 2023"

The Samsung S23 is the best Android phone I've ever used, and that includes recent offerings from OnePlus, Google, Motorola and LG.Having used both phablet-style phones and smaller devices, I find myself gravitating toward the smaller S23. For me, it's just easier to grip, lighter and much easier to put in a pocket.Usually you have to sacrifice something between either speed or battery life. I'm happy to say this phone is both super speedy and has fabulous battery life despite the smaller size of the battery compared to the phablets. I can easily get through a day of moderate to heavy use, up to two days if my usage is a bit lighter.The screen is the best I've used on any phone, including the latest iPhone 15 Pro. It just has a pop to it with vibrant colors that don't feel overdone. Samsung's Android customizations are excellent and very helpful overall. Some complain about software bloat on Samsung phones, but this unlocked version doesn't seem to be loaded down.I'm not a camera expert, but in casual use, I find the camera on the Samsung S23 to be right up there with the iPhone 15 Pro.

I used to have to root to get such features.A few reasons for the 4 star rating... The side thumb fingerprint reader of the S10E was superior. It was faster, had less false readings, and was not in the way of a screen protector.The camera is also lackluster with a lot of noise and artifacts. It feels like there's too much post-processing going on and AI doesn't seem to get it right.

The battery has a good capacity, suiting the phone's power consumption, so you do not need to charge it more than daily. But the most phenomenal aspect is the camera! Take a photo in the 200megapixel mode and view it in Gallery. You can zoom in to your heart's content, the photos are perfect, crisp, and vivid.

I even considered returning it because of the corners and waiting until the next one comes out.

Effectively it is the 256gb version as described. It ""feels"" thicker than both S10 models but according to the official specs it is actually a little bit thinner. This S23 is a little bit bigger than the S10e (as expected) and a little bit smaller than the S10 which is nice! All three phones are about the same width, so one handed operation is possible. From the 256gb, about 210-215gb is available. I applied a screen protector and I had to enable touch sensitivity from the settings menu because the fingerprint sensor failed to read my fingerprints every time, with that option ""enabled"" it works perfectly fine so take this in mind when applying screen protectors. Battery life is very good it can now last me a full day of charge compared to my old S10 models. Screen quality and brightness are excellent, 120Hz mode is a whole new experience. Camera and video quality are also very good and very fast to process. I migrated every app from my S10 to the S23 and the only ""problem"" I encountered was with Whatsapp since I thought I only needed the code they send to my phone number to activate it on the new phone, BUT now it appears you must not delete the app on the old phone because you need it to actually get the code ""transferred"" to the new phone, a whole awkward process that can be frustrating, especially in the scenario where you previously sold the older phone before acquiring the new one.

Lo probé en genshin impact, tower of fantasy y en muchos otros juegos muy demandantes y en todos los juego puedo decir que no bajo de los 60fps y era algo que con el Snapdragon de gen1 no podía decir.En cuanto a el tamaño, si te gustan los móviles pequeños no te recomiendo comprarlo este celular es inmenso y en lo personal es lo que me encanta, si tienes manos pequeñas te será difícil usarlo con solo una mano pero igualmente lo puedes usar.Si te conectas a dispositivos bluetooth como parlantes, televisiones, audífonos nunca tuve ninguna interrupción de conexión .Los parlantes son muy contundentes suenan fuerte y con buen bajo.

It lasts all day and doesn't need to be charged. I charged it one time and forgot to plug it in when I was asleep and the battery has not died yet.The screen is big and really bright. You can turn up the screen brightness all the way and see the screen when you are outside in direct sunlight and not have to worry.The camera is sharp and better than anything I have have used before. I'm excited to take more pictures.The loading time on apps is instant and there is no delay when clicking on an app or using Chrome. Web pages load faster than my old phone. I'm getting full speed from my xfinity modem and I'm getting over 500 mb/s when I do a speed test.The pen is a nice feature I didn't expect to like it so much. It is comfortable to hold and sensitive when you touch the screen and has an instant response time when using it. It has its own battery and a long battery life.I upgraded from a Galaxy s9 which is over 5 years old to a new phone . I upgraded because I couldn't get my phones battery to last more than 5 hours a day.Overall I give it a 5 star review because the main selling point was the 5000 mAh battery. I would recommend it to anyone who's battery doesn't last the whole day.,"July 25, 2023"

Peterson,5.0,"Writing this review roughly 3 months after owning this phone and using it daily. It's worked like a dream ever since day one, speaking from someone who's switched back and forth from iPhone to Samsung over the years. I can say that I prefer Samsung because of all the unique features, performance and build quality. The only real issue I had with the phone at first was that for whatever reason my text messages wouldn't send, but after a quick restart they did, so I wrote it off as being a carrier related bug. Aside from that, it's still the best phone that I've bought to date considering that my previous phone (The iPhone 13) which isn't that old at all, only ever gave me weird issues and poor battery life. Overall I can say that switching back to Samsung was so worth it some key features I like about this phone is how Customizable it is, as well as the 200x lens, and the 120hz screen. Not to mention the battery life is amazing, I can take it off the charger around 6:30 in the morning, and by the time I'm getting ready for bed which is typically around Midnight, I'm still left with anywhere from 30-40%. Granted it depends in how much I use the phone throught the day but thats typically the average percentage.","August 24, 2023"

I have the volume on max and I'm still struggling to hear people. Even the social media videos are playing super low. I keep waiting for an update, but I am running out of patience. I can barely hear anything on this phone (videos, regular calls, Zoom calls, ANYTHING involving sound).Samsung needs to fix this asap. I don't care about the number of pixels per picture.

After 7 months with this S23 Ultra, here are my observations.-Camera is simply awesome.  It can do anything you need it to, anywhere and in any lighting.-Battery life is great for such a big phone.  One day of normal use leaves me with 40-50% battery when put on the charger at night.-Screen clarity is very good.-Will not sync with my Chevy truck.  Apparently, this is an ongoing problem with the droid platform that I did not know about until using this phone.-Bixby, the Samsung version of Siri, is very intrusive.  Makes random calls to people in my contacts and will take over the screen sometimes when I'm using the phone.  When I opted out of Bixby, I was told it would take a week to deactivate.  Why? So Bixby can take it's time harvesting more of my information???-Face recognition is so bad, I stopped using that feature.-Speaker is pretty good.I had high hopes for this phone, but it did not deliver.

Most of us are right-handed and the upper right is the obvious best location.  So I never use the stylus - even though it is very useful - due to the hassle of getting it in and out of the socket.Other than that - great phone!  Flawless performance, truly stunning screen that everyone comments on, much louder speaker than earlier phones.  I have a lot of stuff loaded; apps, pics, music and not even bumping up near half of the memory.I transitioned from a 21Ultra and there were several items I needed to handle, so the change wasn't as seamless as earlier phones.

I don't like big phones & was happy to learn that Samsung kept this version of the S23 at the same dimensions of the J3 that it replaced.

I wasn't looking to upgrade. My S20+ glass finally broke after many drops in 3+ years. It was a champ.The upgrade process was decent but lacking. Some settings were lost and app logins didn't transfer over (except for Google logins).  I have tons of apps and STILL have not fully recovered from the migration. The S23+ supposedly has an eSim but Verizon was unable to find/use the eSmin during the activation process. I had to pull the physical sim from the S20+ and put it in the S23+.I feel confident that the functional capabilities will be fine. It's a Samsung. It's Android.  I have had the S23+ less than a day, so I cannot yet comment on the compute power, battery, etc. I have found the camera quality of the S23+ to be far superior than that of the S20+.I've been having problems with cell signal with the S20+ and suspected the radio might be going bad. Not so. The S23+ isn't getting any better signal, so the issue is with Verizon.So far, my biggest gripe about the S23+ is that it looks and feels like an iPhone.  If I wanted an iPhone, I would have bought one. The S20+ was thin and sleek, with the glass rounded over on the sides. It felt young, vibrant, and sleek, like a cool race car. The S23+ feels bulky and stodgy. It's thicker, shorter, and heavier.  It just doesn't feel as good or natural in the hand.  :(So advice: if you are an iPhone user and you want to try out an Android device, this is the phone for you. If you are a long time Samsung Galaxy Android user, look elsewhere.","August 25, 2023"

Considering whether to try another unit.UPDATE:  Ordered a replacement, but encountered the same problem.  So i believe it is a general phone issue with the S23 Ultra.  However, i decided to try the Smart Switch app to transfer my sizeable music library to this phone.  It worked.  It copied my library completely.

Battery comes completely discharged.  You will need to charge it.  It takes a bit to show it is charging.  Be patient, especially if using the supplied cable.  Recommend purchasing an ac adapter for quick charging that fits your specific phone, ie 25W or 40W.2.  Inserting a SIM card from your carrier:  ""SIM not registered on network""  "" SIM not allowed""...Get the IMEI number from ""SETTINGS"" ""ABOUT PHONE"".  Copy that number down.  Call your carrier and provide them with that number...it'll make your life a whole lot easier than googling the faults and trying all the crap out there running you in various directions except the right one.3.  Transferring data and files from your old phone using the supplied cable is PAINLESS!  You will have to open and log into all your apps again on your new phone.3.

I had many options available to me but after hearing about the processor this phone has + the amazing camera I decided to take a chance with this. Boy I'm glad I did, setup was a breeze, navigation is simple, the phone feels solid, it's fast and feels great to the touch. I was disappointed that no charger came with it and no option for SD card. However there is plenty of space with the 500+GB. Also I purchased a 45w charger and it works great, charges fast. I will say this, unless you only want the phone for basic use the battery does drain a bit quicker than other samsung phones I've owned. Now onto the camera, as a photographer I am always looking for options other than a bulky camera, so when I heard the camera had up to 100x zoom I was enthralled. The picture quality is amazing but does suffer a bit with longer range zoom. The night view works great for taking pictures in low light environments.

Since this is a 3rd party ""unlocked"" cell phone it may or  may not have all the features that you are use to with a phone you purchased from your provider. For instance, Verizon will not allow video calling. So you are forced to use the google Meet Up option which then does not allow you to do a simple thing like switch over to a video call when on a regular call. You have to end the call and then use the google video to call, or start the call as video. Not a huge big deal, but an annoyance when wanting to do a quick switch over to video when on a call. Contacted Verizon, Samsung and Amazon. Finger pointing galore, but no resolution. Also, for whatever reason, I also do not get 5G any more, but it defaults to 4G. Again, not a huge deal, but yet another annoyance with the whole cell phone thing. It's a good phone, takes great pictures, but be aware of the possible issues with buying it from a 3rd party versus your provider.

I have never had any issues with them, definitely easier to use than Apple. I was happy to get this phone, I love the size and I love the picture quality. It takes some amazing pictures! The only problem I have with that is that the resolution is higher so when I send pictures to people with phones that don't support the resolution, the pictures shows up like blurry or pixels. On my end it looks perfect but on someone else's end, it looks blurry. Not sure if there is a fix, I have yet to figure that out. Also, the notification settings are different on this phone and I can't seem to get them to show up the way I had them on my old phone. Again, not sure if there is a way around it. Other than that, I love the size and the speed of the phone. I haven't had any other issues but definitely takes some getting used to.","June 26, 2023"

Jones,4.0,"Having owned the s20+ I was accustomed to its size. The Ultra is a large phone, too large my liking but it is what it is. Placing in your fron pocket is not recommended, I place this in my rear pocket and it takes up all of my rear pants pocket, 5'10 185. The stylus pen is a little awkward to remove and worse if you have a a good case for your phone as you have to dig for it. Apps are are standard for what i use, and fucntion properly. I find the fingerprint to be quirky and sensitive. It attempts to read your print instantly, any improper placement on first try touch will give you incorrect reading. In past I can place finger and settle it on spot before it woud try to read, not this one. The camera is a nice upgrade, with great quality and features. Aside from that its a normal samsung, I would recommend the smaller size unless youre 6'2 or taller with large hands.","May 2, 2023"

I decided to try the Samsung S23 Ultra.  I was afraid it would be a bloated mess with Bixby and all sorts of Samsung apps.  It turns out that the phone is an amazingingly well engineered device that easily allows you to get rid of most of the Samsung apps.  The phone is light years better in T Mobile 5G performance and speed over the Oneplus 9 Pro.  The S23 hardware is solid.  The audio and video quality is excellent+, the networking is excellent+, the battery is way better than the OP9P, and NONE of my apps have had any problems working, the software is excellent too.  Its as if Android app developers test first on the Samsung phones to make sure they work (Just like Apple test theirs phones and apps)  With the OP9P, I would occasionally have the apps just refuse to work, not sure why.  Even Bluetooth worked perfectly on the S23Ultra.Overall, I am super happy with Samsung and am glad to be back to their phones after a 10 year detour to other brands.","May 18, 2023"

I have the 12gb of ram with the 512gb of storage and I have only had maybe one or two problems, but that was on the first update of One Ui 5.1 where the phone was connected to wifi and I did not get any internet access and I had to restart my phone but besides that the phone is very fast and snappy. The cameras are very great quality and the display is as well. The Phone also charges very fast and the battery will last me into the next day or more. I might be wrong but the battery life on this phone is probably the best on the market at the moment. Samsung is not selling the exynos chip sets with these phones this year which is good because snapdragon has proven to be way better. The S-pen is very useful for photo editing, taking photos, taking notes, and even drawing. Sometimes I'll connected the phone to a display and use DEX to watch a movie and I use the S-pen as a remote. The phone also very obviously integrated with Google. You dont have to us the Samsung applications on this phone because it runs on android but the Samsung apps are also very useful. Software experience is very smooth as well.

"SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Flip5 AI Phone, 512GB Unlocked Android Smartphone, Compact, Foldable Design, One-Hand Control, Best Selfies, Full Cover Screen, Hands-Free Use, US Version, 2023, Lavender",TheRevenite,5.0,"Look, I love my Motorola Edge Plus 2023.  It's a great phone.  Really.  And it costs around 2/3 or less than this phone.  I considered their foldable phone to save some money.  Truth be told, they look identical and both this Samsung Galaxy Z Flip5 and the Motorola Razr+ 2023 are extremely similar but we have pros and cons with each.When shopping, I found the Razer+ charged faster and has larger screens.  However, it lacks the performance the Z Flip5 has due to the Z Flip5 having a newer generation processor.  It's not like Motorola didn't have access to the same processor, they did, but to save our pockets, they opted for a generation behind.  Not a deal breaker, but when you catch, like I did, the Z Flip on sale, well, that cost difference becomes less of an issue.Both phone are about as scratch resistant as you can get.  That is my way of saying the first thing I'd do with any phone is put a case on it and put quality screen protectors.  So neither phone wind here .The fact I have three really nice WearOS Samsung watches essentially made the decision for me.  It's sad Samsung disables ECG if you're not using a Samsung phone.  A plus for Samsung is I can now transfer my watch to a new phone or transfer it back to the same phone if I reset the phone.  This prevents having to reset and clear the watches.  Another thing Samsung has done is these phones will desltect you've switched watches and syncs all the health data, alarms, and other items you've set on the watch.  That option is omitted with any other phone.I love this phone.  I like the nice squared sides and flat screen.  It took me a little bit to get used to the small divet where the screen folds, but now I barely notice it.Would I recommend this phone at MSRP? No.  If it hasn't gone on sale and saved me over $300, I'd be writing a review on the Motorola Razr.If the Z Fold is too large for you, this is a perfect compromise.  Folded, it's half the size of my Motorola Edge+ and thinner!The battery life is really all day.  That's seems to be rare these days outside of extremely large and expensive flagship phones.  This phone feels sturdy, so I don't feel like I'm going to break it opening and closing it but a good case is a must.  Bare, this phone is slick and I don't mean just in looks!I really couldn't be happier.  It's fast so gaming is nice and smooth, the refresh rate and color quality allows movies to really look great, and surprisingly, this small phone has pretty loud speakers for their size.The only ""problem"" I have it I get interrupted when I take a call and people see me unfold it.I really am comfortable that the screen will last, and if it doesn't, I have the Amazon insurance.  My really large gripe here is with Samsung directly.  I tried to sign up for their replacement warranty the moment the phone was set up and they require all these diagnostic reports and video proof of virtually every angle while the phone is on running the diagnostics.  Ummm, not everyone has the means to do this and why should I have to since I just purchased the phone and Amazon is an authorized dealer!I'd definitely would buy it again if I needed to.

The folding feature is ACTUALLY useful on a daily basis for either more comfortable use, taking pictures, or multi-tasking. The outside screen is especially nice for photos.No issues with the hinge, 90% of the time I forget the crease is there.I hate how large most phones are, but small phones are difficult to use, so this is a perfect middle ground of being compact but also having a good size screen.I don't have any issues with the durability, but I never drop phones and haven't even broken a screen protector before, so someone with a more haphazard use pattern for their phone will probably be at risk of scratching/damaging the soft inner screen.The facial detection is not great for me, but I have an unusual face so even iphones struggle. The fingerprint reader is good, misreads are infrequent. I wish I could add more prints, as being such a strange form factor means I use different fingers to open it often.Battery is great, you can easily use it all day, even in bright conditions or cold weather.","March 5, 2024"

They let you run anything on the cover and if it doesn't work that's on the developer and you can delete it from the cover.  Has more people have cover screens more developers will support it.  Samsung software really sucks.  I'm a retired Amazon software engineer.THE BAD: I was sad to see it doesn't have a telephoto lens. I don't think I used it that much, but none of my photo apps allowed me to quickly search for the use of the different lenses.I was very disappointed the way Samsung migrated my Samsung watch- it didn't.Several of the cases I bought did not work because they were blocking the wide-angle lens at least partially.The cover screen is great but the tools that come with Samsung make it barely usable. I added GOOD LOCK to it from the Galaxy Store & now it does betterThe Google dialer didn't work with the cover screen and I had to revert to the Samsung phone dialer but that's fine.THE GOOD:  the form factor is great. I really like putting a smaller phone in my pocket although it is thicker.Without installing Good Lock I would be very disappointed but that makes it all usable.  Leaving it folded up looks like it will fill at least half of my uses.Summary:  I think it's a game changer. It's great hardware but as normal I'm underwhelmed by Samsung's software.","August 14, 2023"

It give you a compact phone when closed so that you can easily put it in your front pocket and it's not in the way of things. Then you flip it open to a full sized smart phone.

I've had it for a few months and it has survived a couple falls without a single scratch or crack (like it still looks brand new). The ability to fold also reminds me of a ds or gameboy which is good for the nostalgia feeling. The phone is also able to run games like Genshin Impact and rhythm tappers no problem with maxed settings and no lag at all. The back camera can also be used as a front camera which is great for better camera quality. Good upgrade from my old phone! Just note that it has NO headphone jack and NO sd card slot which is mildly annoying, but overall not a big deal. As a preorder bonus I actually got double the storage space, but even so, I'm nowhere near halway storage use so I wouldn't worry about lack of external storage for a long while.The battery itself takes awhile to fully charge, but it lasts a long time. With constant use and power saving mode turned off, the phone battery lasts me about 14 hrs.If you download Good Lock (samsung app) on the phone, you'll be able to do a lot more with it. For example, you can add more apps to the back screen along with be able to change app icons for more customisation.","September 23, 2023"

And customer service has no clue... At all! Seen similar problems on Reddit too. Hello Samsung do something! I do not have a short stubby nose nor does my face shaped like a hamburger. With that said, everything else is cool. I mean it's nice I can have a wallpaper of Gojo winking at me on both screens. Pretty cool! You can also utilize the small screen for everything when phone is closed. Facebook discord calls Spotify everything that app will allow you to (you do have to install this app forgot what it's called but you'll be guided in the Samsung store) Which is fun but I personally like the opening and closing mechanism. Especially withending a phone call lol. Those born in the 80s-90s get it. If you're tired of the tablet iPhone this is a nice change except the camera makes me look like Shrek.. Few things on battery in the begining it doesn't seem to last a full day now it does but I do charge everyday unliek my iPhone 12 max, other features like face recognition not as intuitive as apples! Same with their fingerprint.. it doesn't respond as well it's buggy. the texting on keyboard when you make a mistake is slightly different than just long pressing.. to me apples is easier and ive been a user for both phones. Yeah if all these things bother you, Buyer beware. Do I regret it 50/50 just cause my iPhone is still here...

Since I can't post a pic without access to my phone (too bad). It's much easier to handle due to the miniscully smaller outside width and then there's the weight difference. Wonder how long the battery will last, great now but its new. And the phone case protects the lenses to a degree better than the note. Didn't like paying the bigger price though it was a hundred off and the extra cost 512 hd would've been another 300 and hard to attain later, so. Unless I'm on web away from wifi battery life is day plus to day and a half. Much improvement over my last phone. I like it. Less consumed space in pockets and easier to keep in.","October 9, 2023"

Carrying this phone in your pocket and holding it in your hand is such a delight due to the smaller size significantly lighter weight. The small outside screen is awesome, once you figure out the apps you need to install in order to maximize its use. Being able to use the outside cameras for selfies and the ability to show people what the photo will look like while taking a picture is a really cool feature.CONS: Let's start with saying I had to return the phone. Although I was enjoying my time with the phone, the thing started to get HOT. I had to turn off the Always On Display, use Low Performance Mode, and Dim the Screen just to be able to give it normal use. Even then, the battery life leaves a lot to be desired. I had to charge the phone multiple times during the day just to be able to get through the day without the thing dying. The overheating and battery issues are definitely related and, unfortunately, an issue that I just couldn't get past.SUMMARY: I am hopeful these issues can be addressed in a future iterance of the phone. I really enjoyed the time that I has with the phone and debated multiple times whether to return it. Unfortunately, the overheating and battery life is are important factors that can't be ignored. If I have a phone, I expect to be able to use all of its features without having to decide between using said features or having a stable phone to use.","September 28, 2023"

"SAMSUNG Galaxy S21 FE 5G Cell Phone, Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone, 256GB, 120Hz Display Screen, Pro Grade Camera, All Day Intelligent Battery, US Version, Graphite",M Mullins,5.0,"My last phone was a Samsung A10e, and anyone coming from a cheap A series phone can for sure tell you that this is a MAJOR upgrade. I got the 128gb S21 FE model and I only paid $590 USD for the black version, despite really really wanting the white version, yet that one was priced at $699 USD. Would I pay $699 for it? Probably not, but everyone has a different budget for everything!When I received the phone, it came in its regular factory box which is very thin, like I was concerned for a second that they just sent me a case, but nope! They've cut down on everything that they send you. It came with the phone, a manual in a tiny box, a sim card tool behind that box, and I believe short type c cable, I already have a charging cable so I didn't pay any attention to it. Not that big of a deal really, it just worried me for a second haha.Now I'm someone who worries about storage, and this phone does NOT come with a micro SD card slot (unlike the S20 FE), however I've not had any problems with my storage yet, I still have roughly 61GB out of the 128GB to go. The system itself is 22.5GB which is expected as this is a very beefy and fast machine, and then I play a lot of games so my apps take around 39GB. I don't take many photos either so I only have around 1GB used, but if you are someone who loves to take photos, I recommend getting a separate portable hard drive or even using your personal computer to send your photos over, as spending $70-$130+ for just 128GB of more storage is a lot when you could use that to get around 500GB on a standalone drive. It is also worth mentioning that getting the bigger storage version for this phone, also adds 2GB of ram to it, giving it a speed boost, but I'm about to go over some things about the phone's speed.As for game wise, I play Genshin Impact, Colorful Stage/Project Sekai, Stardew Valley, Pokemon GO, and Fallout Shelter, and this thing runs them all like a BEAST. I wouldn't recommend getting the extra 2GB of ram in the bigger storage model since this phone can run pretty much anything you throw at it. Anyone who's ever played Genshin Impact knows how heavy the game is, and it can run it at max settings just fine, the only problem, is that it gets INCREDIBLY hot. So hot that it lowkey hurts to touch after playing for more than just 5-15 minutes. This could be completely fixed if you get a cooling mount for around $20-30. I do prioritize game functionality and speed over looks so I do play extremely comfortably in low-medium settings as it still looks great! However if you're looking for a gaming machine with smooth fps and no lag at all with maximum settings on heavy games (since bigger temperatures means lowering the processing of your game, causing lag), I'll have to recommend looking for a different phone such as an Iphone or a Oneplus since they do that well.The camera is good for me! I take photos of my dog and that's it. It also has a 30x zoom which is crazy. The front camera is really good and I sometimes put it up to my head and angle it to make myself look like a goldfish and it's super funny haha. The fingerprint reader works extremely well even with a screen protector. Fun fact I found: you can lay your finger over your fingerprint reader while the screen is off and it'll unlock! So you don't even have to double tap your screen to wake it up or press a power button. I was never a fan of 120hz screens and I still am not, but it looks super smooth when I have it turned on. The AMOLED screen was a huge game changer for me, it's beautiful and has incredible contrasting colors. I know people say they have tons of issues with the battery to this device, but I honestly haven't had any problems whatsoever. Now I do keep medium power saving mode on as I just don't see too much to the use of allowing your phone to do any big background services when you're not using it. It lasts about a day and a half. I work 9-5 and I come home with 70% battery after being on it or checking it very often and frequently. Now I will say there has been some connectivity issues during heavy storms and heavy storms only, but I experienced that issue with my last phone so there's a massive chance that's just my mobile data provider (which is US Cellular). By the way, this phone is unlocked, so it should be able to accept just about any other provider you use. I also think it supports 2 sim cards? I'm not too sure as I'm not someone who would ever have to use it, but if you are, then that's a plus.Overall this phone is absolutely amazing and I 11/10 recommend it :)","August 17, 2022"
"SAMSUNG Galaxy S21 FE 5G Cell Phone, Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone, 256GB, 120Hz Display Screen, Pro Grade Camera, All Day Intelligent Battery, US Version, Graphite",Shawn,5.0,"I got my S9 after my S4 crapped out after 5 years (screen went off, wasn't even cracked).  My S4 & S9 served me very well!  I had the S9 for 4+ years it simply is an amazing phone.  I was at a crowded place, and someone knocked my elbow while holding it.  It fell, and the screen cracked pretty bad (not like one crack, many cracks).  Screen still works perfectly, but, I was scared it could stop working at any time.  So, I needed a new phone.  I looked at the S21 FE and S22.  At the time I purchased, the prices were about $200 different (then a week after I purchased, prices were the same!).  But, I'm happy with my purchase.  I liked small phones in the past, never had a bigger one.  I am actually enjoying the larger screen.  Better for viewing content.  I'm a guy and my pants pockets are plenty large for this phone as well.  Feels no different than my previous S9 in my pocket.  I've watched a lot of YouTube reviews of the camera / video quality / test pics and footage, and it seems they are almost the same (sometimes I prefer and think the S21 FE image / video looks better, others the S22 looks better - kind of a toss up).So, what have I noticed?  Well, battery life is amazing!  Beats my S9 by FAR!  Now, my S9 was 4+ years old when I had to replace it (now use the S9 as a ""camera I'm not worried about losing or breaking"").  I had the S9 for a long time, and I cannot remember how good battery life was when I first got it.  But, I don't recall it ever getting worse either.  What I can say is, I used to have to top my S9 up a bit at least once or twice a day.  My S21 FE, lasts ALL DAY (and I even have the battery saver setup so it only charges to 85% - never did that with the S9).  And even from 85%, I get a full day no problem!  Usually around 35% or so when I am ready for bed.  The screen is great.  I do leave on 120hz mode all the time.  I also have dark mode turned on.  I like how it looks, and dark things on screen use less battery than bright white things.  But yes, battery is great.Now the cameras.  My S9 actually had almost identical video.  I make YouTube videos and the S9 did me very well in 4K by 30 or 60.  I do notice the S21 FE is ever so slightly better image.  It also has better stabilization and just some other processing stuff that helps out.  The pictures are better for sure.  I've taken pictures of people and shown them, and they've been like, ""What phone is that?!?  The pictures are sooooo good!""  The S9 did well.  But, the S21 FE is for sure an improvement.  I used to use my G7X Mark ii for most pictures, because it just was better by far than my S9.  Now, I don't think I ever really need that camera anymore.  This phone produces awesome photos!I haven't had a single issues, no glitches, no nothing.  Just a smooth perfectly working phone.  I did kind of like the S9 having the fingerprint reader on the back.  But, I quickly got used to the in screen reader.  It works fast and great.  Apps load fast.  Camera is on in an instant with a double tap of the power button.  Just really nothing to complain about.  I would have kept my S9 another few years, but, I am happy with the S21 FE and hope it lasts me 5+ years as well.Great phone, if you are looking into it and deciding if you want to get it, I for sure recommend it.","July 26, 2022"
"SAMSUNG Galaxy S21 FE 5G Cell Phone, Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone, 256GB, 120Hz Display Screen, Pro Grade Camera, All Day Intelligent Battery, US Version, Graphite",M Mullins,5.0,"Edit: I'm a super heavy user.  I'm at about the 6 month, and now the device gets warm when it's taxed or the weather is a little warm.  And the battery life, whuch is still great, and dropped down significantly.  Love the phone.  Very concerned about the longevity. Particularly as i come up on summer in floridamark Edit:  one month in, and I love it!  Battery lasts all day, and I'm on my phone nonstop.I'm used to the change in buttons and actually like them.  Put in settings so power options do come up now. Like the screenshot method, mostly.Got a supcase military grade unicorn beetle case so it's well protected.  Signal is great on tmobile.  5g is slower than 4g, so I turn it off.  but I'm out in the middle of nowhere.Touch screen works perfectly even under double acreen protectors!  Updates get sent all the time.  So worth it!And my mom is blown away by the telephoto lens.  For me it's a fun binoculars, but pretty mushy picture quality at telephoto distance.  S9 couldn't do that at all. The close up distance/focus is much better than my s9.  The rest is pretty similar.---It's only been a couple days but so far so good. None of the touch screen or overheating issues a few people listed on the internet.I took very good care of my S9, but it was overheating often. This is night and day difference.I thought the volume buttons above the power button would take some getting used to, but actually the only downside is taking a screenshot is more difficult. Oh, and the power button no longer turns it off! Although I've read There are some workarounds for that. Otherwise you have to go up in the menu.I love that it's the same width as my old phone, but taller. Gives me more space but I can still hold it.I absolutely hate that there are no good colorful heavy duty cases out for it yet. Come on OtterBox!I wanted to go with the S10 because I was nervous reading reviews, and how new this was. But this was cheaper, and so far I'm very happy with my choice.Please note, red it definitely an orangey red.  I went with red so it would be more visible if all I could find for now was transparent cases. But if I could go back I would definitely choose purple again.I've also read a lot of people turn the 5G off because it's not available everywhere and you don't really want it constantly switching between 4G and 5G. 5G was coming in pretty good for me out in the boonies with T-Mobile. I did switch it to 4G yesterday and that also worked fine during a trip.Transferring information using Smart Switch actually worked really well for me. My S9 main Drive was completely full.  The SD card was half full. This brought over ALMOST everything perfectly, and it wasn't even very slow.  The only things it didn't bring over were  paid apps that I had installed with a different Google account. I had to add the rest of my Google accounts and do those by hand. Not sure if that would have been any different had I installed all the Google accounts first.I would say it's very slightly brighter than my S9. I don't have a problem with the camera being on the screen.Haven't had great luck with a fingerprint yet, but I do need to redo it since I put a screen protector on anyways.Happy happy!","November 27, 2020"
"SAMSUNG Galaxy S21 FE 5G Cell Phone, Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone, 256GB, 120Hz Display Screen, Pro Grade Camera, All Day Intelligent Battery, US Version, Graphite",Earthling1984,4.0,"Now that the price on this phone has gone down to $600, it is a very good deal for the price.The Snapdragon 865 processor is more than fast enough for anything I want to do. 6GB of memory is less than some other phones in this price range, but it is still more than enough for most people.The phone feels very solid despite the plastic back. If you use any kind of case, you won't even notice the plastic back.The phone supports 25W fast charging, but for some reason they only included a 15W charger in the box. Buying the 25W charger separately is a waste of money as well as a waste of the natural resources that were used on the 15W charger. Amazon sells decent 25W fast chargers for less than $15, so cheaping out on the charger is a real lame move by Samsung. You can search Amazon for 15W chargers that support ""USB-C PPS"" mode and are UL Certified.The screen looks beautiful when you turn on the 120Hz mode. This does burn your battery more quickly, but the battery is big enough that it still lasts all day.The screen has been very responsive to me. I have read bug reports about screen glitches for some people. Samsung has already released bug fixes that hopefully have fixed this. I advise only buying this phone from an authorized dealer with no hassle returns so you don't have to worry about this bug.The phone does have a lot of Samsung bloatware. I owned a Samsung S-series phone several years ago and the bloatware was really bad then. This one is much better. You don't even need to create a Samsung account to use the phone now. Most of the Samsung bloatware (other than the camera app) won't work if you don't have a Samsung account, but if you never use it, this isn't a problem. There are several tutorials online about disabling all the bloatware if you never want to see any of it on your screen.The triple camera setup on this phone is very good for this price level. The telephone camera works great up to 3X in good light. Image quality deteriorates quickly if you zoom in past 3X or in lower lighting conditions. Telephoto cameras are getting rare in this smartphone price range, so I'm glad this phone has one. I really like using the telephoto lens for landscape and nature photography. The normal and wide angle cameras work better in lower light situations (including indoor situations), though not as good as the iphone or Google Pixel phones. Pictures do tend look more processed than with some other phone cameras. Some people like the Samsung look. Other people prefer more natural looking photos. You should try to look at sample photos before buying the phone, since you cannot completely disable the Samsung photo processing.This phone comes with Android version 10 out of the box, which is one version behind the Android version 11 that the Google Pixel phones are shipping with. Samsung promises software support with 3 version updates, but that is a little misleading since 1 of those version updates will be just to catch up with the current Android version 11. Still, 3 years of bug fixes and security patches is better than what Samsung used to offer.","October 29, 2020"
"SAMSUNG Galaxy S21 FE 5G Cell Phone, Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone, 256GB, 120Hz Display Screen, Pro Grade Camera, All Day Intelligent Battery, US Version, Graphite",L8rGator,5.0,"The CPU is fast and the phone has enough RAM to the point where your phone doesn't freeze up opening certain apps. The storage space is generous and the SD card slot area is pretty dope as well. It may seem inconvenient, unless you're upgrading from an android phone that had a back piece where you could take out the battery. The camera shoots in 4K and allows you to focus on an object.For those of you who don't know what 4K is, think 4K HD a certain adult film companies uses cameras of this quality, lmao.The price is reasonable, especially for all the features, storage space, RAM and other specs that this phone has. The camera is on par with most newer iPhones if not better. It's approximately as big as the iPhone 13 Pro Max and faster. I've tested this out personally. The Samsung FE series is quite a refreshing experience. It's well worth the price.Oh ANOTHER THING. If you like decent headphones, this phone sports a newer version of bluetooth connectivity. It will have better connection to wireless earbuds, wireless headphones, smart TVs, bluetooth speakers, cars that support bluetooth, etc.The colors are of a nice variety and the display is beautiful. You can watch videos in 4K quality. It is also, a legit pro gamer phone. No game I've played has ever lagged. The download speed is pretty impressive as well.Overall, if you prefer Samsung phones or great phones at reasonable prices, then I'd recommend this phone via Amazon.The best function is the Bluetooth tethering. You can share your phone's wifi/data with another device WITHOUT it using your mobile hotspot data AND WITHOUT being charged. You can even charge another Qi compatible device off this phone or charge this phone off a Qi compatible device.I apologize for the rant, lol.Also, so far as of June 2022, this is the last high end Samsung phone with a micro SD card slot.You also power off the phone differently. You don't need to hold the ""power button"" on the side of the device. Screenshots are also different. You hold the ""power button"" and the volume down button at the same time for one second.This phone can also block Apple ID.

"SAMSUNG Galaxy S21 FE 5G Cell Phone, Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone, 256GB, 120Hz Display Screen, Pro Grade Camera, All Day Intelligent Battery, US Version, Graphite",l2,5.0,"This phone is solid. It's interesting that in 2020, a ""budget"" phone is 700 dollars but it is definitely a great value for the money. The cameras aren't as great as the regular S20 line up but they are a solid upgrade coming from the S8. Just make sure you have great lighting if you plan to use the ultra wide lens or telephoto because photos get very grainy in less than  ideal conditions. Battery life is solid. I work all week and when I'm not on my phone a lot, I easily get 2 days and squeeze  in a few hours from the next day if I really can't get to another charger. If I have a day off and I'm on the phone for hours,  I can easily make it to the end of the day at 20+ percent. The screen is great. Colors are bright and the quality 120 Hz refresh rate screen is buttery smooth to navigate. The phone is definitely bigger and closer to the Note 20 (non Ultra model) in terms of size so that takes some getting used to. Touch could be a bit better. Sometimes you have to touch the screen more than once to activate the screen or to select something. The fingerprint reader is an optical one so it's hit or miss sometimes. I have found that  if I pay attention to where I place my finger, it tends to recognize it more easily.  I just never thought I'd miss the one on the S8 considering the poor placement of the thing.  The stereo speakers can get nice and loud and are better than the single firing ones found on my old phone. Reviewers say that the sound is not as rich as the more premium version of this phone bit if you're coming from a phone that is over 2 years old with only a single speaker, you'll enjoy them. Definitely get a phone cover because the plastic back does scratch and dent easily if you drop it on asphalt as I'm finding out. Haptics are another area where Samsung cut back on this model. The vibration feels close to that of the S7 in a cheap way. To their credit, they have calibrated the vibration motor to react more like when you are moving the cursor around on a text box like that found in a pixel. Just don't expect a solid thump like on the note 10 plus or the S20 models. 6 Gb of ram is plenty now but I may wish I had gotten a phone with 8+ GB in a few years after some OS updates. Only time will tell. Its a crazy time and hard to believe that phone prices have inflated the way they have but if you can get the phone on sale, it's a no brainer and very easy to recommend.","December 28, 2020"
"SAMSUNG Galaxy S21 FE 5G Cell Phone, Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone, 256GB, 120Hz Display Screen, Pro Grade Camera, All Day Intelligent Battery, US Version, Graphite",Anonymous,5.0,"I didn't think I'd ever be able to afford a new Galaxy S-series, and if my old Galaxy A-51 hadn't died, I wouldn't have spent the money to buy a new phone...but it completely died after 2 & 1/2 years, and could not be repaired, so I had to. However, at a $399.00 Cyber Monday special, I was able to get this 1-model-back S-21 for what I'd have spent on a comparable A series! And two major things the S series features that the A doesn't is that it supports wireless charging, and smart watch connectivity! It also has a much better camera, and I'm sure I'll find other great features as I go along. The color isn't as ugly as I was afraid it would be- you can actually put a tinted clear case on it and make it a little more pretty, or completely cover it with a solid case. It doesn't come with any extras like Galaxies used to in the past, like a manual, a case, a wall plug, a car plug, or screen protecter- nothing except a shortish cord and a tool to pop out the sim card slot, which is on the side.My service carrier is a government Lifeline company which runs on the T-Mobile network, so I just put my old Sim card in my new phone and it was connected instantly with the same phone number & provider, but I did have to go through all the Google setup, which would have been way easier if my old phone had not been dead, but I got all of my contacts back (though without their photos I'd put with their names), and I lost all the photos from my dead phone; I got most of my apps back, but I did have to reinstall a few, and log into most again in order to use them.Galaxies stopped making the body casings openable a few years ago, so batteries can't be replaced easily, and to try to get them repaired, a tech has to melt the sides of the case open, which turned out really ugly when I tried to get my A-51's charging port replaced (which didn't save my old phone anyway), and it looked like smeared crap after they melted it back together, fyi.This is a very desirable phone, despite the new attempts to make it more throwaway. Hopefully it will last me at least 3 or 4 years- that would be $100. a year...plus interest....it's sad how much things cost so much today.","December 2, 2022"

"SAMSUNG Galaxy S21 FE 5G Cell Phone, Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone, 256GB, 120Hz Display Screen, Pro Grade Camera, All Day Intelligent Battery, US Version, Graphite",Star,3.0,"Edit (7/30/2023): This will be the last update I write about the S20 FE, as I plan on getting a new phone in the near future.After 3 years with this phone, I can't say my feelings have changed very much. The only reason I'm writing this is to warn anyone thinking about getting this as a budget phone at some point in the future. The glue holding the back panel has loosened to the point where it is lifting off the phone. There is no bulging battery, as far as I can tell. The cheap glue that they used to put the S20 FE together just isn't holding together anymore. They tout having software/security updates for however many years, but what good is that if the phone falls apart before you get to that point?To anyone reading this in the future: no, this phone isn't worth $499 (the price amazon has it as I'm writing this) new in 2023. The chip is still okay and it has that precious SD slot that phone manufacturers don't want to include nowadays so people buy the expensive, higher storage models. If you really, really want one to use as a budget phone, look for a refurbished one. I've found ones being sold for under $150. Who knows? Maybe the phone refurbishers used better glue to put the phone back together.I haven't decided which phone to get next. All I know is that it won't be a Samsung._________________________________Edit (8/18/2021): I've dropped my rating from 4 stars to 3 stars.It's been a little less than a year, and the issues mentioned below have started to affect daily use in a way that turns this from a great phone to an okay phone not worth your time. Okay, maybe not daily use, per se. But enough that it's starting to effect my initial thoughts on it.The amount of times this phone has turned on in my pocket because of ghost touches is insane. Every time I take it out of my pocket, it's opened a random app and input a few letters on the keyboard. And this is after adjusting the settings to stop these sorts of things. I turned off double tap to turn on (despite wanting that feature) and turned on accidental touch protection (which did absolutely nothing). I even made it so that the phone needed face recognition or a fingerprint to unlock every time I close it. But it just keeps happening. No software update really fixed the screen, as suspected. This is a pure hardware mess up.Here's the cold, honest truth: the screen on the S20 FE is terrible. Worse than my old S7. Worse than even a budget android phone's screen. It's beyond comprehension. The virtual proximity sensor is also worthless. I almost want to give it the classic ""angry Amazon customer 1-star"" review, but I'll refrain. There's still good here with the chip, customizability, and great battery life, but that stuff can only get you so far.Here's my advice: don't bother with this phone. You can get a midrange smartphone for the same (or even a lower) price, with better specs. It's still not the worst thing out there and I'm not tossing it in the trash just yet, but it's definitely the last Samsung product I'll be buying. So disappointing, but I couldn't keep this review a 4-star in good conscience._________________________________I decided on the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE for my smartphone upgrade for a lot of reasons. One, and most obviously, was the price. At $599 ( the price on Amazon when I purchased it), it was an unbeatable deal. Another was the specs: Snapdragon 865 and 6gb of RAM was perfect for my needs. My old Galaxy S7 looked practically primitive when set against the S20 FE. And so, I decided to give a midrange phone a try.At first glance, the S20 FE seemed too good to be true. The screen, while not 4K, still looks great with the 120Hz refresh rate enabled. The rear cameras look incredibly good, nice and crisp. I've done everything from web browsing and gaming to word processing and photography, all with minimal issue. Battery life is solid, but not the best in the market right now. You'll still be able to get a couple of days out of the S20 FE on 120Hz. Also, you can't beat the customizability of Android. With the option to install launchers/widgets plus a wealth of storage (and SD card support), you get a lot of choice with the S20 FE. The size, while much larger than I was used to, still fits in the hand really well. I would recommend getting a case and screen protector for this one though, as I have seen people shatter the screen with a single drop.But, if you've been reading up on the S20 FE at all, then you know that there are problems. First off, the virtual proximity sensor on the phone is spotty at best. Testing it out myself, I had to be right on top of the sensor for it to detect my face. And for phone calls, that means a few more accidental muted/ended calls than usual. The face recognition and fingerprint scanner are also not great. I'd say it works about 85% of the time, but when it doesn't, do you ever feel it. Adding on, the front-facing camera is pretty lackluster. Not bad, but it's not flagship levels by any stretch. You'll need to be in absolutely optimal lighting to get a decent picture out of it. So if you're looking for a phone to take selfies indoors with, I'd look elsewhere.From what I've seen, the standout complaint with the S20 FE is the touchscreen. And yes, my phone (ordered in early November) has the issue too. Pretty horrendous ghosting when testing it in the touchscreen test app. There's undeniably a hardware issue with the S20 FE. There have been updates since the phone released, but none have fixed it entirely; merely a band-aid on a bloody gash. The real question is: does it affect everyday use? Will you notice it every moment you use the S20 FE? The answer to both is no, at least for me. While I'm sure it does affect certain tasks (most notably those that involve fast touches or 3+ fingers), I really haven't noticed it in actual use. Pinching/zooming with your fingers close together will cause the screen to jitter, but that's about all I've seen. If that worries you enough to pass on the S20 FE, I don't blame you.It really is a shame that I can't give the S20 FE a perfect 5 stars, because it does deserve it in some aspects. But with these hardware issues, there's always the worry that time will make them worse. It's a genuine worry, I get that. But even with the problems, the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE is a pretty great phone. It really does feel like a flagship phone, but with a massive price cut and a few downgrades. Only time will tell if the problems the phone has will get worse, but for right now, I'm more than happy with it.","November 18, 2020"
"SAMSUNG Galaxy S21 FE 5G Cell Phone, Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone, 256GB, 120Hz Display Screen, Pro Grade Camera, All Day Intelligent Battery, US Version, Graphite",June,5.0,"I tried out the Galaxy (I think?) A71 and hand a lackluster experience before I got this phone. Upgrading was one of the best tech decisions I've ever made.For such a thin and 'delicate' phone, I was worried about how well it would handle everyday life. I never got an indestructible case, just an air-based protection to help keep it from getting dinged up, and this phone has still survived my clumsy hands dropping it all the time. I would recommend a good screen protector, since this phone is All Screen! It makes videos easy to watch and reading text is comfortable thanks to the amount of space I get.The camera is truly stellar. I take a lot of photos of plants and small animals and my photo quality is always very crisp and the color comes through clearly. I've only dabbled with the pro-style lense and the built-in 'photo enhacement' software a little bit, but I think anyone who posts regularly to social media would be able to use those functions well and have some stellar pics come out of it.The battery has suffered, but when I say that I mean it goes about 10hrs on a full charge. Compared to my iPhone 8, which hit the ground running at 12hrs and dropped off dramatically. The original battery was anywhere between 24-36hrs based on my usage, often high because I used my phone for work. Even with the shorter life, the fast-charging mode means I've got my battery juiced in about an hour, maybe two if it's fully dead.The phone can struggle to work as a GPS unit at times, especially when layering GPS, a podcast app, and being plugged in for my car's android auto to work. Typically this only happens to me on long drives, but if I set the phone on an AC vent it can keep chugging away the entire time.","June 28, 2024"
"SAMSUNG Galaxy S21 FE 5G Cell Phone, Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone, 256GB, 120Hz Display Screen, Pro Grade Camera, All Day Intelligent Battery, US Version, Graphite",M Mullins,3.0,"Last update, 12/24/22This will be my last update, as I traded this in for a Google Pixel 7. With the price that I bought it at, and the amount for trade in I received from Google on their Black Friday sale, I couldn't pass it up and was basically a wash.This phone never received a monthly security patch. I don't know if that is a Samsung, Amazon, or T-Mobile issue (and maybe it is because I had bought the 256GB storage option??), but it is a major one to me. I don't know if this phone would have even received One UI 5 (aka, Android 13), and I traded it in before I heard it was released in the US for this model. In my few months with this phone, the best thing about it was the price - both amazon's sales price, and Google's trade in value. Take that for what you will if you have a use case similar to mine.Update - 9/15/22I have not received any security updates (August should have been out, by now, September was just released, but my phone is still on the July patch the phone shipped with). I am not sure why this is, and unlike a Pixel phone, there is no way to force/sideload a security patch. In the same timeframe, my S20FE did receive the August patch. I am holding off for now and hoping this is a fluke, but if I don't receive the September update by October, this may indicate an issue with phone itself.Update - 8/9/22After going caseless for a couple of days - both on wifi almost exclusively one day and on 4G LTE another - the case was likely the issue. Both tests resulted in a warm, not heated phone after heavy usage and over 6 hours of screen on time. The Spigen thin hybrid was the same case I had for my S20FE, except this one was not the ""clear"" option. I am not sure if the hard type of plastic on the back did not displace heat well with this phone model or if something in the non-clear cases are made with a material that interferes with RF signals, but that case was returned and a cheap, all-TPU case was purchased. Screen on time has continued to improve from the barely 5 hours before to 6.5-7 with the same usage now. As such, I have added one star to my review. I still encounter ghost touches and I am not sure how much of an improvement the case change has been to signal strength, but this has gone from an underwhelming experience to a solid option for those that can get a good deal on it.Original review below:I have bought and used both an S20 FE (6 RAM/128 ROM) in 2021 and an S21 FE (8 RAM/256 ROM) on Prime Day in 2022. While the S20 FE ended up being almost the perfect phone for the past year, the S21 FE was not worth it, even at Amazon's great price.S21 FE Pros1. Slightly smaller than the S20 FE, and I found it easier to handle - a few millimeters makes a huge difference here.2. Camera was excellent as every other Samsung phone I have owned has been.3. Phone had the July 5th Android update waiting to download when I received the phone in mid July. My S20 FE was about a month behind on monthly patches (probably due to Samsung prioritizing newer phones).4. Solid construction - Like the S20 FE, I have no worries of this getting bent, punctured, or damaged from compression, as I have experienced on some phones. As with just about every other phone I have owned, I have a TPU case on it to prevent fall damage.S21 FE Cons1. Battery life. A little about my settings: after doing all updates, I factory reset the phone to have a ""clean"" install. Downloaded all apps and then turned auto brightness and NFC off, only have bluetooth on when in the car, screen set to 60hz refresh, 5G off, and mostly on fiber-connected WiFi at home. On my S20 FE, this could get me 9 hours on-screen time for one charge easily. The same settings on the S21 FE barely eek out 5 hours with a slightly smaller screen and the same battery size. Not sure if this is a bad android security update (which will prompt an addendum to this review next month) or the phone itself. But underwhelming after 2 weeks of usage.2. Possibly tied to the battery - it seems a lot warmer than my S20 FE ever got when using for long periods of time. Will be using without a case at home to see if that is part of the issue or not.3. Connectivity - I wouldn't say there are rampant issues per se, but it does not seem to have the signal strength when using 4G LTE when out and about. Again, the case may be a factor here, and will be using without for a couple days.4. Ghost touches - have had odd things happen with active on display stopping music, or tapping one area of the screen to open an app and something else entirely launches.At this point, this was not worth the upgrade for my use case, and I probably should have just bought another S20 FE instead. My phones get full usage daily, and it is just a matter of time before the S20 FE's battery starts to take a hit. However, with the charge I get out of the S21 FE, I probably could have stuck with my current S20 FE for quite some time.","July 28, 2022"

Only one of those dozens of phones survived the first year intact and almost-fully functional.  Enter the S20FE. A week after activation my phone fell off the side of a pool table and cracked the corner of the screen,  expectations plummeted and i figured I'd need yet another new device before the winter's snow had melted.  A few years later and I'm happy to say i was wrong *as i post this review from that same device with the same cracked screen.  I've put this phone through at least the 7th depth of hades: it had been frozen,  drowned, burnt, shot at, stabbed, shocked,  and seen things that shall forevermore remain unspoken of.  And it still works great.I truly can't stand anything bixby, despite having restricted as much a possible it is  still ever-present and annoying.Expandable memory issues and the battery would be my 2 biggest gripes. This phone just loves to corrupt larger capacity memory cards.  Cards of 512gb, 256gb, 200gb, and 128gb have all corrupted & rendered unrecognizable by any other devices i own. 512 was almost immediately,  128 survived a few months but required several reformats performed.Battery life is pathetic. Unplugged maybe an hour now, done little more a couple quick searches & compose this review and already battery is down 15%.  This makes me miss the good old days of being able to swap batteries instead of having to carry around an entire battery pack and leave charge cables hanging from pocket to pocket.","March 2, 2024"

I got it for $400 on Amazon- the most I was willing to pay for a phone in 2022.But I'm not very happy with it. It comes with a lot of nonsense apps and just isn't as efficient as the pixel.I'm going to compare this to the Pixel because other than the oneplus nord20 it was the best other option for me and the one I went with.The pixel has a good price of $300 (when it's on sale.) That's the most I'm happy to spend on a phone (obviously I was willing to pay a bit more though.)The pixel is just a much better phone in my opinion- at least for an adult. For me the FE 21 is a candy phone. It's a phone a rich parent would give to a kid (usually- obviously there are different adults and kids), but the Pixel 6a is a useful phone.I have really loved Samsung for a long time. I always bought their phones, but Samsung keeps coming out with more and more expensive phones that are more and more gimmicky.And I swore that I would never spend more than $300 for a phone after spending a lot on Samsung 10e (just wasn't worth the dough). I bought this phone anyway, because, hey, inflation? I wanted to like it since it's Samsung.After trying it out I said, enough is enough, and kept my Pixel.Two things that are better about this phone though:1. the screen has the strongest gorilla glass (victus or whatever.) The pixel 6a uses a really, really old one. That's annoying and not okay.2. This phone is much easier to fix. I've taken apart my S10e and know that Samsung phones are easy to fix. If you want, take a quick look on Youtube or whatever other video website and look for ""Pixel 6a screen repair."" It's not a phone that makes sense to fix :-(. If it breaks you throw it away.But in the end those two reasons weren't enough for me to spend 25% more on a gimmicky candy phone...Have a nice day :-)Update:Oh and the phone doesn't come with a charger. The phone brands claim that it's to reduce ""waste"", but to be honest, I don't know anyone who just throws away an extra phone charger!!! Probably 95% of people keep it as a secondary charger or a charger in the car or something. And there are also the people that for whatever reason just don't have a charger. We don't all inherit chargers at birth!I would take off a star for that, but pretty much all of non-Chinese designed brands are doing ir. That being said, companies like Blu (American owned and designed) or Motorola (Chinese-owned, but Chicago designed) aren't!!!!","December 26, 2022"

After using it for a few months I like its battery life better as it lasts me through the day.The phone is highly customizable thru the ""Good Lock"" app.The volume on the speakerphone has been useful a few times when I have taken while riding my bike with the phone on an armband.I still highly recommend this phone, specially when there's a sale or refurbished one available. More bang for the buck!-------I upgraded from a Galaxy S8. I love the bigger screen size. I miss the physical thumbprint on my old phone, but the on-screen one on the S21FE is very responsive. After reading about all the issues people have had with the Pixel 6, I was wary. This phone exceeded my expectations. It is fast and the screen size is just right. For my older eyes I can read well, and will just fit in my back pocket [inside of a Spigen case].The sound is good as I place calls on speakerphone or listen podcasts while I mull around the kitchen.The battery is average, it is great that it can be charged wirelessly since having it in my jacket pocket while I cycle I get condensation and would not be able to charge it with a cable until it fully dries.I set my refresh screen to 60Mhz to save some battery and the scrolling is still smooth.To nitpick, it would be nice to have a SD card slot when I want to shoot a lot of pics or bring extra lectures (videos) to watch at my leisure.The modem has been great and I have been getting speeds of 300Gbps in Chicago (Metro by T-Mobile)I am very happy with this phone and think the icing on the cake was that it will get 4 android versions.

"SAMSUNG Galaxy S21 FE 5G Cell Phone, Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone, 256GB, 120Hz Display Screen, Pro Grade Camera, All Day Intelligent Battery, US Version, Graphite",Felice jamaica,5.0,"I had my previous phone, a Huawei Mate 9  for 3 years (ordered from Amazon), and I felt it was time for an upgrade. After researching and narrowing my decision down to the Google Pixel 5 and the Samsung S20 FE 5G, I chose the S20 FE 5G. For me, it came down to being able to expand the memory and I prefer to have that option. So far, everything works great. I love the pastel color choices! Cloud lavender looks pretty and so does the Cloud Orange, but I had to go with my favorite color, Cloud Mint.The fingerprint reader is accurate and fast. When unlocking the phone, the bright light is a little blinding, especially if unlocking the phone in the dark. Face recognition works great and it unlocks well with my eyeglasses on too.For the battery life, it seems that it doesn't last long compared to my previous phone. With the S20 FE 5G, I noticed with my normal use (watching YouTube videos, using social media, surfing the internet, etc.), I would have to charge it after a day, but with the Mate 9, I was able to use it for almost 2 days before having to charge it.I love the quality of the rear/front camera. The rear camera focuses well and the photos appear brighter/sharper which I like. The front camera is fixed and doesn't allow for autofocus when tapping on the screen, which I'm bummed out about. I hope this is something that will be fixed. The super steady mode is awesome!Included in the box: phone, charging adapter, charging cable, paperwork, and the sim tray eject tool. I do wish the charging cable was a bit longer and I wish it came with earphones, but it's not a big deal. I'll be buying a usb-c to 3.5mm headphone adapter. I do have Bluetooth earbuds, but I prefer connecting directly for better sound.When I received my package and I opened it up, it came with ZERO packaging, which I was unhappy about. You would think it would come with some protection with bubble wrap or air pillows to avoid the phone from getting tossed around in the box. Amazon, please make sure the package is secured well so the product we are paying $$$ for arrives safely.","January 25, 2021"

I have been a Motorola user with my last being the Moto 5G Plus.  That lasted only 2 years and then moved so slow and functioned so poorly I knew I had to research and move into the big leagues.  I am so thrilled with every aspect of this phone.  Its screen is vibrant and colorful.  Its video quality is superb and scrolling around and going between apps it moves like lightning.  I am extremely impressed with the camera and video quality as well.  Some complain about the selfie camera.  At first I was not happy but did my research on how to use all its features and now I am beyond thrilled.  Everything here far surpasses all my expectations.  Phone call quality is excellent and the audio from the speakers also shines.  Bluetooth connectivity is a breeze and music and audio books sound excellent.  This is all enough for me to love this phone but add in the battery life and it becomes a true winner.  With excessive use I get at least a full day out of it.  I never got half a day with my Motorola.  I have installed a 128 gb sd card for quality amount of storage.  This phone never falters and performs at the highest level all the time.

For $635 , the phone is quick the cameras look really cool on the back but I'm not a fan of how clear they look the picture is fuzzy and is always halfway zoomed in. Coming from lg Google phone from 2017 the samsung ui and ecosystem is mediocre at best, it feels really slippery and unfufilling like every app you open is opened on accident like you just slipped into this app. Counter intuitive power off process(its not the same as to power on wtf ). Bixby sucks to say the least, a lot of wireless half baked features that are impractical. But the phone seems reliable enough, I know how to maximize battery life like first changing the wallpaper to a black and white version, limiting 5g/network(I like how you can easily enable 5g if needed, but who really needs that much power?), and of course keeping no apps running in the background, and putting the phone on do not disturb mode so it doesn't vibrate itself to oblivion, which is weird because the phone forces a lot of notifications even after you turn them off or minimize them. I expected a little cleaner software, honestly would have preferred a brand new s9+, but I couldn't find anything that wasn't refurbished. I turned the 120 Hz refresh rate off and boom the battery is lasting a couple days on the regular love 4500 MA battery. I like the glasstic back, but be warned there is a slippery feel to it so go to eBay and grab a quick 10 buck case to be safe. Overall I'm happy with the device. The expandable storage is very nice and I bought another 128 gigs for 30 bucks at target so I have all the memory I need and more! Just wish I could switch to the Google version of software but keep the Samsung hardware, because those pixels are looking weak! Watching the iphone 12 commercial made me shrug and grateful I had this phone, the price, the value, and the vibe of my mint cloud samsung 20 fe is one that is pretty much unmatched! The box is the phone and charger, the speakers sound is a little above average. The fingerprint reader is solid and practical. Totally worth it.","October 15, 2020"

Too expensive.But this was on sale for Prime Day and a very good deal.

Saved $180 on Prime Day. Much cheaper than if I bought it from my service provider. I can only compare it to my previous phones but this is a very noticeable improvement in quality and operation.It works well, quicker and a little smoother operating than the S10e. In switching sim card to this phone, there were no glitches for the service provider, Consumer Cellular. I play a lot of games. and the apps are running without crashing anymore and it works well. Battery is solid not great, but a definite upgrade from my previous Samsung. Display is sharper and a bigger screen which means a better viewing experience for my old eyes. Setting up the fingerprint security has improved greatly since I last bought. Much quicker and easier.

It's definitely missing basic features like a headphone jack, that I enjoyed on my Samsung Galaxy A52.That being said, the thing with Samsung phones is that the battery could be twice this size and it'll only last as long as the average time of other brands. Samsung has horrendous battery managent because they force you to always run their bloatware. You can't uninstall them and some you can't remove notifications or stop from running.In general I really like the camera and the screen. You can't get the specs that this phone has for the sale price. It does have smaller cameras but it's about the software and the sensors being used here. I can have a phone with 100+ megapixels and still lack the details that this phone provides. It's why I turned down similar Motorola, Nokia, TCL and other branded phones.I also wanted dust resistance which this phone is good at. Truthfully, LG phones blew these Samsung phones out of the water. But hype and brand popularity kept Samsung chugging along while real competition got removed. So now I'm stuck using this phone until another company comes along. But it is a good phone! So no worries there. You just won't have good battery life. Also Samsung phones are notoriously slow chargers, my 5yr old phone charges faster than this thing. I'm talking about older than 2010 speeds. Definitely buy a fast charger!

I concluded that the problem had to be with the QI system within the phone, and initiated a return procedure to Amazon, intending to request a simple 'return and replace with identical item', but that option was not available for the phone. Amazon indicated that to speed up the process, I should chat with their specialists before simply returning the phone for credit. After a one-hour 'chat' with Amazon technical help, who finally transferred me to Samsung technical help, who spent another hour before they concluded that I should take the phone to a Samsung-approved service center, which is 2.5 hours away, with no assurance that they could resolve the problem; even less probability they could resolve the problem in the same day...I processed the standard return-to-Amazon-for credit application. Then with a confirmation that the return was approved, I simply ordered another (identical) phone. On it's arrival, I quickly transferred all app, data, etc from the old phone to the new phone, swapped the SIM carrier (containing the SIM card and the external memory card). The new phone charges easily and quickly on both Samsung wireless chargers, even with the Samsung cover on the phone. Using the straight-forward Amazon process is simple and efficient, but when people get involved, the efficiency is subject to total loss, simplicity is gone, and patience becomes a victim.","January 29, 2021"

Replacing my LG Style 6, which measures over 7"", this Samsung phone is smaller but still comfortable to use in most regards.  Most phones I and my wife have had these past several years have their fingerprint reader on the back of the phone, which is much easier to use and more comfortable.  The Samsung S20 FE has a fingerprint reader embedded on the bottom of the screen, which is a bit awkward to use.  But the fingerprint reader is fairly accurate providing you follow the directions and scan multiple areas of your fingertip.  The screen is vibrant with deep colors & good contrast.  Since my phone is primarly a phone that I occasionally use for texting, I haven't used the camera yet nor do I use all of the features associated with video.  I have my dozen or so apps that I use frequently, and they all work well on this phone.  There isn't much bloatware installed by Samsung; most of it is installed by Google.  I do seem to get a bit better connection with this phone.Setup was a breeze.  I use ConsumerCellular as my carrier, and all I had to do was move my SIM and microSD cards from the old phone to this new phone, and everything was automated after that!  I used the SmartSwitch app to transfer from the LG phone to the Samsung phone, and that went smoothly, easily and without issue.","March 15, 2022"

For those of you with Spectrum Mobile service, 'in my experience,' the S21 FE phone works without issue. HOWEVER, do not expect meaningful support from Spectrum. The Spectrum Compatibility Web App reports the S21 FE is incompatible with their network. However, it also reports incompatibility for my wife's Galaxy S21 Ultra and my old S8+, both of which perform well on the Spectrum network. Chatting with customer service yielded the same result: incompatible. However, after switching the SIM card from my S8+ to the S21 FE, about fifteen minutes later, I received an automated email from Spectrum stating I would be enjoying their 5G service within an hour. Less than twenty minutes later, the network recognized my phone's IMEI number and connected it to the network. DISCLAIMER: The foregoing is for informational purposes.

I contacted my carrier and tries swapping the sim card in another phone, which shows that the sim was working fine. So I contacted samsung customer service again, they told me to send the phone over to repair it. After about a week, I have received the phone. The service statement says cause of problem was WPC FAILURE, and solution was S/W UPDATED. I got my phone back after a week, the software was updated and the phone was working fine so far. Hopefully there wont be any more issues in the near future.---------Purchased the S21fe early July this year, been having so much issue since purchased. I was unable to receive phone calls for over a month. Tried so many things to fix the issues. One day, I was able to receive phone calls after resetting everything, and thought the problem was finally resolved... I was wrong. Another issue popped up; the audio quality during phone call became so bad, the other side couldn't understand a single word I said. Then again, after the help from Samsung customer service, I was able to resolve that issue. While I thought everything was good.... I couldn't receive the phone call again!!! Have booked an appointment with a local service center, hopefully they can fix it. Aside from that, my phone still hasn't received the August security patch, it has been one month since the patch released.  It's been so frustrating trying to deal with the issue and having to worry about missing important calls. (Also can't return it, because I thought a software update would fix the problem and has been waiting and waiting, and 30 days has passed, issue still there)","September 16, 2022"

After using the new S21 for a few days I can almost live with my old glitches and cracked screen.  For a brand new phone this battery drains QUICKLY.  I am already going to be ordering another fast charging port so that I can get through the day at work AND the evening before charging it fully at night.  Another feature that isn't working is the face recognition.  That isn't a deal breaker for me since I am content using the fingerprint option, but something I've noticed just the same and wanted to mention in case you relied on it.I have had LOTS of Samsung phones and am always happy with them, but this one misses the mark a bit for me mainly due to battery life.  Since purchasing I have done a few tweaks that were mentioned like going to dark mode and restarting more to make sure I am rebooting once in awhile (which is something I rarely had to do on my S10).  I am hoping that makes a difference.","July 22, 2022"

Performance is alright but it's Android so you will occasionally get app freezing every now and again. Camera is good (not great) but pixel 6 is better. I love the many many features that Samsung that this device comes with such as Bixby routines (game changer), Samsung Dex, secure folder, good lock, RAM Plus, a customizable always on display, edge panels, link to windows for synchronization with a windows computer, smart widgets (stacking multiple interactive widgets together that can rotate) video call effects with apps such as duo as duo, WhatsApp, MS Teams, zoom. The screen recorder actually captures the audio from a zoom or Google meet etc. Battery life is good enough once you don't use 120hz all the time (Bixby routine can help with that).This phone will get 4 years of OS updates and 5 years of security updates so that's really great for longevity.Wouldn't recommend it for $699 but if you see it on sale for much less (you certainly will on Amazon) then go for it","May 6, 2022"

The battery life is pretty good; I get a full day on one charge although I don't play a lot of graphic heavy games, just mainly social media and online browsing, emails etc. I may eventually go back to Apple but I like that I could purchase a brand new phone at a reasonable price and not be locked into a device agreement for three years or so.

Im switching over from the original Pixel XL. Wasnt thrilled enough with the Pixel 5 and 4a 5G lineup/availability. So I thought I would give this one a shot.  Overall its been a good first day with the phone.I popped in my Verizon sim card and after setup (see below) I immediately had cell service and 4G connectivity. No problems there.Setup was kinda a pain switching from a Google phone. I had my old phone backing up to Google drive. The setup process didnt quite help make a full transfer. It pulled in my contacts and app data, but didnt reinstall my play store apps automatically or transfer my SMS/call history. What I ended up doing was using the Samsung Smart Switch app. I installed it on my old/new device and it transferred every thing.  Contacts, SMS/call history, app data, photos, videos, etc. It even started automatically installing my missing apps. That was nice.Performance wise the phone feels pretty snappy and has a nice display.  I havent had a chance to play with the camera yet. Today was just 'get the phone up and running"" day.My biggest issue is not with the phone itself but with the the original listing on Amazon when I purchased the phone a few days back. It said the phone had 8GB of RAM.  That was a selling point for me.  When I booted up the phone I check the settings and it says 6GB. I came back into this phones listing in Amazon and wouldnt you know, now it says the phone has 6GB of RAM. Hmmm... That kinda ticked me off. But not the phones fault.","October 4, 2020"
"SAMSUNG Galaxy S21 FE 5G Cell Phone, Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone, 256GB, 120Hz Display Screen, Pro Grade Camera, All Day Intelligent Battery, US Version, Graphite",Kimberly M.,3.0,The phone does work as a smart phone. When I can get it to take pictures in focus they are nice but it is hard to tell until after if I am not specifically looking at the focus.Auto focus:The auto focus is painfully slow. Sometimes it just works but most times it works after a solid 1-3 seconds. Sometimes it takes >5s which just leaves me wondering what it is doing that could take this long.A perfect example is with normal lens everything in view of the camera is >20' away and it is just stuck out of focus for 3 seconds. Then the focus finally starts to wander after another 1-2 seconds it focuses.This seems to affect both the normal and zoom lense. I don't use the wide angle much but I would guess it has the same problem.The final result of this is if I'm in a hurry and not paying attention to the focus 1/4 to 1/3 of my pictures are out of focusFinger Print Sensor:It works okay most of the time. When in a dark environment it is blindingly bright if you don't cover the entire sensor before the back light turns on at ~100% brightness.Also sometimes the phone unlocks at 100% brightness too which just seems like sloppy programming that doesn't turn down the rest of the screen brightness before it displays it. It seems like it realizes it is dark after the phone has been unlocked for a 1/10 of a second.Overall it makes unlocking my phone in the dark painful at best. It feels like it is wrong more times than it is right so I close my eyes before I try unlocking it.Using the Camera kills other apps:I run and keep track of it on my phone. If I take some pictures while running more often than not the camera app will silently kill all apps running on the phone. So when I get done I find that my phone stopped recording when I took some pictures. There doesn't seem to be a way to stop the camera from killing everything. In testing I can get runs that are 39 seconds long by taking pictures shortly after starting the run.Note: Moved to this phone from the S9,"December 22, 2020"

The battery life is impeccable for me! I am a young person. That being said, I am on my phone very often. I have watched hours of movies, YouTube videos, and shows. I am not much of a tech nerd but I can say that compared to my old phone the battery lasts more than all day, after countless hours using it.I originally bought this type of phone because I hoped that it would not be obsolete in two years like my old LG K10. I also bought this phone for it's DeX feature. You can basically turn your phone into a computer desktop if you have a projector or desktop computer/laptop using an HDMI cord to type-C. This is an awesome device! The screen is very colorful and watching videos on it is perfect!I must say that this phones fingerprint reader is horrendous. It has only read my fingerprint about 62% of the time. I really do not care about it, because my old phone never even had that feature. I have not tried the face recognition feature yet.Something that I do not like is the back camera sticks out from the phone a little. I would recommend you get a phone case right away, or at least get camera and screen protectors ASAP. If you drop your phone one good time without a case and protectors, your whole phone would probably malfunction. The cameras I think would shatter internally.","August 3, 2021"

I bought this after my S9 began to really slow down and stop working. This phone is, hands down, amazing for the price. I've only used my portable charger once since buying this phone and that was when I first got it and the phone was at around 50%. I was so used to my old phone dying I didn't realize the battery life on this one was great. I can leave my house at 9am at 80%, use Bluetooth and play around on it almost all day, use snapchat and text and watch videos on it, and come home by 9pm to 20% and it can still go for another hour.I've used this phone up to 5% with no real issues and for someone who's out the house for hours at a time, this is great news.The fingerprint reader is, in my opinion, better than the S9 and in a better place. The facial recognition is also great. And the ability to transfer all my data AND keep my pages in the exact same layout was, no doubt, AMAZING!The only MINOR complaint I have is the lack of a microsd slot. I personally don't need it much but some might and I could see how that'll be an issue.","April 6, 2022"

First, I bought the Galaxy S22+.  It got really hot and the battery drained so quickly.  Plus, the outrageous price.  So, I returned it.  Look around, read reviews, and I found this S21 FE 5G with 8gb Ram and 256gb memory.  Got it on a good deal on Amazon Prime Day  I love this phone.  Yes, it's an older model, with older Snapdragon 888 processor, and plastic back.  But with Snapdragon 888, the phone does not get hot, and the battery life last me more than a day.  And I use Spigen Rugged Armor case to keep the phone safe.  Therefore, whether it has a glass back or plastic back means nothing to me.  And it was half the price of the S22+.

I didn't have to take the phone to store, I didn't have to log in and change settings, etc.- The 120hz OLED screen is game changing (for me).

It's also running the 20 series flagship processor.- Camera is amazing.  3x zoom and wide lens. Yesss please.- I love the colors. I got the Orange.- Samsung's OneUI is a huge improvement. Very intuitive and very powerful. I've been setting up advanced Bixby routines.

I tried giving the Sony two chances because the camera features are nice but it wasn't enough enough to cover the flaws. The s21 ultra was fantastic, but I couldn't justify the price tag. This phone however was the best. 120hz screen makes it feel premium, but hardware is not slow to where to muddied the user experience. The screen is bright, and it's not 4k but you can't tell on a all device. The battery life also lasts so long because the resolution is not high. Samsung's interface is quite nice and it certainly makes using an android phone extremely enjoyable because it doesn't feel cheap like the Sony did. I will never use an iPhone again, and it was hard for me to find a great alternative. I was hesitant on getting a Samsung too because I was in love with Google products up until the pixel 5.

"SAMSUNG Galaxy S21 FE 5G Cell Phone, Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone, 256GB, 120Hz Display Screen, Pro Grade Camera, All Day Intelligent Battery, US Version, Graphite",KalvinStein,4.0,"Im upgrading from a Note 8 to this so needless to say its a very welcome upgrade overall except for a few things. Battery life is much better considering how old my Note 8 is. Screen is a downgrade as its only 1080 over my 1440 but still great for what it is. The fingerprint reader is a double edged sword for me. Coming from a note 8, the position of the reader is an upgrade (the reader on the note is on the rear of the phone) but its reliability is iffy. Sometimes itll recognize immediately and other times it takes it a while to recognize it. This is a common issue documented elsewhere as well but not a deal breaker. The biggest issue for me is the camera. While the camera is better than the note 8s on paper, in the real world im having issues with it. The focus is terrible, especially while using flash. The camera consistently gets confused as to where it needs to focus and flash pictures are completely unuseable. Overall a great phone but decide if what I described is a deal breaker for you","May 31, 2021"

Many years. This screen is a little weird. Sometimes it won't track my finger completely, when I'm scrolling text. It's really disconcerting.The fingerprint reader doesn't work as well as older Samsung phones where it was on the back of the phone. Those worked almost always... maybe once every couple days it would need a second read.This one, probably 10-20 times per day it won't read my fingerprint right, and I have to do it a second, third, or fourth time. Occasionally it will even refuse to read so many times in a row I have to draw my pattern to unlock.Final problem: when I'm taking pictures with it, sometimes the camera app will ""freeze"" for 10-15 seconds at a time. It will seem like it's working, but just won't take a picture, no matter how many times I jam that take-a-picture button on the screen. Really annoying to lose 15 seconds of shots because the camera app sucks.One time it stayed ""frozen"" so long that the ""camera app has stopped responding"" thing popped up.","April 8, 2021"

I felt the upgrade after 2 weeks of use ( or even in an lesser time), the s20 fe is not a phone you can easily hold with one hand, the plastic back may seem cheap, but, it grows on you, also it won't break as easily like a glass back. The front camera doesn't disturb you when you are watching videos, movies, pic etc. Gaming, it will run very smoothly. Battery, if the phone starts at 100%, by the end of the day it won't be fully dead (even if you have the 120hz screen, which is like spreading butter on bread, you won't go back to 60hz after using the 120hz).Once you get to play with the phone itself, you will notice this cellphone can compete or even win its sisters like the s20 or the s20 plus (heck it can probably bit the iphone11 just with its extra perks)For the price you get, you won't get rip off. It's nice that you can this phone at an reasonable price and not spend 1k on a phone that can do the same thing.Highly recommend if you want a good Phone and for a great price!!!","April 13, 2021"

The reason why I decided to buy it however though is for 3 reasons; 1. Value for money; 2. Wanting to stay within the Samsung ecosystem and 3. The software support lifetime.For all reasons above and you may have read before, if you are wondering...the s21 fe DOES deliver!However, there is one (and a half) nitpick which influenced my 3/5 rating.1. (The half) - The battery life, though great seems a bit beneath the standard for modern smartphones, this can be attributed to the absence of an adaptive refresh rate on the display (so basically it's either ALL IN or 50% IN with your display)2. (The actual stuff) - The phone is advertised to be dual sim, heck even the model number indicates ""DS"" meaning ""Dual SIM"" and while the phone does have 2 SIM trays to back this up. The sad thing is, only ONE works at a time. The Quick Start Guide indicates that ""a software upgrade will be required..."" however so far I'm THREE (3) updates in and still no Dual SIM functionality. This will be pretty devastating to a lot of persons who travel internationally, however its even worse that Samsung is seemingly misleading its consumers with features but no functionality.","June 20, 2022"

It's fast, stable, and feature packed.  I replaced an older LG G8 and this is my first Samsung phone since the original Galaxy (which I was horrible for me).  I bought this because it supports an SD Card and was otherwise a relatively inexpensive, yet full featured phone.If I have one notable complaint, it's how the camera physically protrudes from the phone.  Not much, but it prevents it from sitting flat on a surface (unless I have it in a case).  This might be necessary for the camera's features and the ""thinness"" of the phone, but it makes me concerned about scratching the camera glass.  While there are glass screen protectors for the camera glass, they don't stay on well unless appropriately protected in a case.Overall very good, but I don't like how the phone makes me concerned about damaging the camera area and doesn't otherwise sit flat outside of a case.","November 20, 2021"

That is a great phone with working Dual Sims, looong battery life, and expanded memory. The didn't tell me they were shutting off my device they just did it. After a back and forth, I learned the Ulefone company is not partnered with AT&T, so they were rejecting their unlocked devices in the U.S. I went to the AT&T store, and I was told the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G would work with dual Sims on the AT&T network. They didn't  have any on stock other than the display that features two sim slots. I checked Samsung  online and it also advertised  the dual sim US functionality.  Finally, I came to Amazon and I purchased it after verifying the dual physical sims. It cost me $634 with tax. My Ulefone that worked great cost $120-$130 also on Amazon. I was willing to pay 5 times more for a slightly less powerful phone because of AT&T's stance on non partner unlocked phones and Samsung and AT&T's verifying  this was a Dual sim capable  product. After receiving it, I used AT&T's social media support to re-activate my line via a phone call. They said they didn't do the dual sim support and ended the call. After spending a couple hours transferring  everything  - apps, passwords,  pics, etc. - I finally reached Samsung chat support. After I submitted picture evidence  that it has 2 sim slots, Samsung came clean. They don't release the software for dual sims in the U.S. (because carriers don't want it I've learned), BUT they said that they will release the feature update ""soon."" When is soon? ""Soon.""If Samsung and the distributor advertisements here on Amazon wouldn't have misrepresented this phone, i wouldn't have purchased it.

I am a Sprint customer and because of the merger and network confusion my phone thinks a 5/5 Sprint 4G LTE signal is  roaming and tried to grab the 1 bar TMobile signal..Now for the showstopper.  The touch hardware is complete and utter trash.  The October firmware update helped a bit.  The sensor array is in a horizontal/Vertical grid.  If you touch three points on the screen and slide any of those fingers past the same grid line as another finger, it drops the moving touch . 4 out of 10 times, and strobes like a series of taps the other 6. The strobing lasts for 1/10 second or so.  I used developer mode to show touches and can watch the touch just disappear.  Now if I place two fingers on each side of the screen so they're both on the same horizontal plane, and then move a third finger between them it drops touch and then strobes every single time.This really looks like an issue from the early days when companies were struggling to get multi finger gestures to reliably work.  Perhaps Samsung used a design made in 2006-2008 to maximize profits. Shameful.I pre-ordered this phone. I have never preordered any piece of hardware. I did it because ""Samsung knows howmto make a phone. That is one thing they get right, unless it explodes..."".  Well, apparently Samsung forgot how to make a touchscreen screen.... Yes, Samsung.  A screen.  That's your thing... You make screens. You screwed that up like a first time manufacturer.  And then you decided to sell it anyway. You even mentioned ""Games"" in your advertising.This is my third Galaxy S10 FE with this same issue.  Initial phone was Sprint branded (returned), second was unlocked (waited two weeks for more information and spent over an hour on the phone with Samsung, the Requested replacement), replacement phone has same exact issue.  Failing 3/3 of the time... That looks like 1... Yup.  100% failure rate. This is after the October firmware update that was supposed to fix the touch bugs.","November 1, 2020"

I spent months debating between Galaxy s10 or s20 series, but couldn't stomach spending almost a grand on a phone. When I saw this s20 FE was released with all the bells and whistles of the $1000 phone and for a more reasonable price, I had to go for it. The phone came undamaged, no scratches or smudges or anything. The battery life is great. I have a lot of screen time throughout the day, and by the time I go to bed at night I still have within the 70% range of battery left. The cameras are cool, but I haven't had a chance to really mess with the features all that much yet. I love that it works with my wireless charger. The display features are awesome.

One area of the screenlooked a little off to me but I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me and pushed through. I noticed the bend( which slightly warped part of the screen) about a week in but ignored it because it could only be seen under certain conditions and because i believed it to be harmless. However within a few weeks I noticed that the touch detection when I'm typing often messes up, especially when I'm using swipe. Not only that but after applying a screen protector the issue becomes very obvious as it's never able to properly adhere to the warped area of the screen. I contacted Amazon about the problem and was told there was nothing that could be done because my complaint  was outside their ""satisfactory window"". Now I'm left with a device with a factory defect that I have to pay out of pocket to fix. Now I understand why my friends refuse to buy certain tech items from Amazon.Other aspects of the phone are pretty great safe for the fingerprint reader which is a bit hit or miss but I'm not sure if it's meant to be that way or just a result of the aforementioned bend.","September 1, 2022"

Didn't take long for the Samsung to start freezing and become slow to respond. So now I have two phones that kinda suck for a total of 1k. One can't be returned and with price drop means I'd be lucky to get a hundred bucks in resale. So returned this one and will live with flaws of the TCL. Maybe I'm expecting too much for the price. 300 bucks should get a decent phone. So for 200 more than I want to spend freezing and glitches this early is not good news. Haven't tried iphone yet.

These phones were mid tier at best phones bought for 200-300 dollars each time. They always got the job done but I was never impressed by the speed of the phone,  often times running Facebook by itself would run slow let alone multiple apps would stall the phones a ton.So over 4-5 years I bought 4 phones for about $1,2000 total, figuring each time I was owning a phone almost as fast as a Samsung for 1/5 the price. I run an Etsy and Ebay business now and my phone is my life. On my Motorola everything was average, the camera, the processor, the ram, the battery, etc.So I had been researching these new Samsung phones,  especially the S23+ Ultra and this Z Fold 5, and feel in love with everything I saw, including the reviews. After owning mid tier phones for half a decade I guess I simply forgot there's a reason why if you love Android over IOS you go with Samsung.Pricey, sure it is. But my God, the display is a thing of beauty to start. The speed is also so incredible I forgot what it was like to multi task on a phone in Nana seconds with absolutely no lag. Samsung truly knows how to build a superior product and it's worth every penny!!12 gb of ram make this thing run multiple applications at once without any problem. In settings there's even an extra mouse that takes 8gb of your internal memory and turns it into more ram,  which is icing in the cake.The phone itself is extremely solid and hard to break or Crack. I bought the case with the s pen built into it and love the features and case. Folding it out to watch you tube videos feels like in using a tablet whenever I want,  as well as running multiple apps side by side flawlessly.The camera is super impressive with the 50mp option that really helps me take great photos of my vintage products I sell. Couldn't be happier.The only, single complaint, if I dare call it that,  would be the battery life is very similar to the moto phones I owned before. Even if I only use the front screen it doesn't last as long as I expected. Luckily it comes with a special charger that literally takes it from 20% to 100% in line 40 minutes,  so I'm satisfied as a whole with the battery,  not enough of a problem to not give it 5 stars.Thanks Samsung, I now remember what is like to have lightning fast operating system, to get every actual notification correctly, a screen to watch movies and videos that's amazing, a Samsung one OS that makes the fold out screen work flawlessly with multiple apps, and settings for every tiny thing possible.I spent $1,500 instead of $300 on a moto, but I'm sure this phone will last me 3-5 years easily. Definitely recommend this product.5 of 5","January 25, 2024"

For this phone, I believe it is especially true. If you have an use case that fits it's form factor and specs, then you'll be the happiest camper. In case contrary, you might find yourself with a phone that is more annoying than helpful.I travel quite a bit, need to work on the go, and love to read comics and books. For many years, I've traveled with a tablet (for reading), a laptop (for working), and a phone. I've switched in the airport waiting room and on my seat from one to the other, scrambling to put things away, and having more devices than I'd like going through security. This phone absolutely solves that. I haven't practically used my tablet since I got it and the laptop stays in my bag at the airport and on the plane.By the way, the unfolded phone surface is very similar to a Kindle, so it is a superb replacement for one, especially with the dark theme, that causes less strain to the eyes.Additionally, I used to carry my tablet to the table to watch Netflix while I eat, I colored and drew on my tablet to relax, and I played games on the bigger tablet screen rather than the phone. This phone solves for all that.I like that is narrow, it's easy to hold. When I run outside, I typically carry my phone in my hand so it doesn't bounce in my pockets. This is a very comfortable phone to do that. I had an iPhone 8 Plus before, and it got uncomfortable after a certain time.There is only one drawback that I've found so far. I also go to a climbing gym a couple of times per week. I used to bring my old phone with me and listen to podcasts while I climbed. I didn't care because it was an old iPhone 8. This phone stays in the locker when I go climbing because a) it's not a cheap/old phone, and b) I am concerned the chalk I use for climbing might damage the interior screen.Typing in the narrower screen might take some getting used to, but it is not too annoying, to be frank.I've only had the phone for a few weeks, and I am still learning all there is to it, but for now, it really seemed to have been designed for me.

It really is a whole lot like having a computer in your hand given the computing power and larger screen.The thing is that really is a bit of a compromise.  To make the dimensions work out OK they made the front screen a bit narrower than I like and the opened device doesn't fit that well in my hand (and I have fairly big hands).What works fairly well for me with the main screen opened is that I put on a case which has a s-pen holder which goes on the back of where the screen folds.  I'm right-handed so I have my left thumb on the left edge of the phone and my 3rd and 4th fingers holding onto the spine that holds the s-pen.  That makes for a fairly secure hold.So the case makes the phone more workable in one way.  But the case makes it a bit more difficult to get the fingerprint reader to function well.  Without the case the fingerprint reader works very well indeed in my opinion.Despite the utility of having the S-pen spine on the case I'd probably not use a case at all if it weren't for the fact that the caseless phone is sufficiently slippery that it feels like it will fall out of my shirt pocket if I lean forward more than just a little bit.Facial recognition is not great but not that bad either.The features it brings are extensive and I'm still exploring the multiple screen functionalities.My granddaughter enjoys drawing in Samsung Notes and that has more value to me than you might think.  A much better experience than what I got with my previous Samsung S22 Ultra.Yes, I have quibbles but they are not that big a deal and I think that in the Fold 5 we might be looking at the future of portable phones.One other thing?  I hope Samsung will figure out how to store the S-pen in the phone as was the case with the S22 Ultra.  I'm not really sure that will prove to be practical given that it might result in excessive thickness of the phone - and mean less room for the electronics and battery.","November 21, 2023"

Now with work, this phone caught my attention.TLDR [SUMMARY]: Great device, easy setup, major android improvements throughout out the years (missing some basic iOS features that are nice to have). Two stars because the seller for this device sold me a damaged phone, so word of caution, be careful who you purchase from. The manufacturer screen protector was removed so the warranty is voided as I found out by going to a Samsung authorized repair shop when I noticed screen discoloration after a week of light use.  Also, there is an active SIM card in the phone, but the tray is broken so I can’t remove it 😩. Photos attached.First the pros:1. The size and feel are phenomenal. The phone feels sturdy, not cheap or like it will break easily. The size is great especially for Zoom meetings when away from the desk or working on documents where you need can utilize the large screen for editing on the go (Note: editing text, not formatting an entire document on the go)2. Android has made many improvements over the years. I thought I would hate getting used to the Android OS but it was pretty easy getting used to it. There are a few nice to have features that I still enjoy about my personal iPhone (tap time to scroll to the top of the page/screen you’re looking at, native visual voicemail). The setup was very simple for me to complete.And now the cons:1. The phone arrived with an active AT&T SIM card in it. The tray is broken so when I try to eject it, only the top part comes out. The SIM and rest of the tray remain lodged into the SIM card slot. Yes, I can disable it and use the eSIM from my carrier but for the price of this phone, I don’t feel that’s worth it.2. This device is my work phone so it receives very light usage (meetings, slacks, and email) if I happen to not be in front my computer for any reason. I’ve only had it for about one week when I noticed the crease of the screen is discolored. It has vertical colored lines in it. I thought maybe it could be the manufacturer’s screen protector that might need replacing (which should be covered by warranty). When I took it to a Samsung authorized repair shop, I was informed that there was no screen protector on it. Sadly, I am returning and seeing if I can justify spending more for a brand new one.I’ve attached photos of the screen and the active SIM line.","August 4, 2024"

I bought two cases but the second case didn't protect the screen the front screen if I was making a call, not the flip open one. while I talking to someone I dropped it the second day, cracked the front screen pretty bad :(. I even had a front screen protector onp order. The USB C sucks, I've had luck with most of my usb c devices but maybe 1 out 10 just don't like usb C. so I can't really use that to charge the phone.I turn off all my apps, Bluetooth, brightness you name it and it just drains battery. This phone literally lives on the charger. I've never had a phone like this before. yes it was my fault for dropping the phone but it was eating battery life this before that happened. I rarely ever open the phone up either, so I have no idea why it drains the battery so fast. I think the fold is a cool idea, but I'd rather get the flip or just a regular smart phone. I haven't really had to many needs t opens the phone up itself. maybe if the battery life were better I'd be more opt to use it more often.I went ahead and just put my sim back in my old phone for now. I guess I get ahold of samsung support. I can live with the cracked screen, but this battery life issue makes the phone useless to me.

I thought it was the flickering rate, PWM, blue light etc. All Based on my amateur Internet research.Anyway, I conceded and decided to see an Ophthalmologist, and a he told me it was because I needed reading glasses. I'm in my early 40's. That was it, while they did work, it was a mild improvement. I wasn't getting the tension headaches from the TV, computer monitors, so figured a more horizontal mobile device would help.And this phone did!! With free returns on this phone, I figured I had nothing to lose. Those headache issues are gone now, thank God!In addition to my issues/experience the fold phone is amazing!! It performs way better than any vertical phone lol","November 24, 2023"

Performes great with apps, decent taking pictures but the absolutely worst thing of this phone is battery size.Comming from s23 ultra, using it heavily all day easily went with a single charge no problem at all. fold5 on the other hand, need almost 3 charges for the same amount of use (no even in tablet mode), that is really mediocre for this flagship/expensive device.Definitely not a device for everyone.Final tought: still too expensive and lack of standard features to replace/ compete with s23 ultra.S23 ultra pros: outstanding camera, great battery life, included s-pen, overall really thin and lots of accessories/cases for it.S23 U cons: compared to note 20 ultra is heavier and battery life is shorter.Fold 5 pros: confortable tablet mode.Fold5 cons: BATTERY LIFE, just ok cameras (main ones, selfies/in screen are rubbish). Folded screen not s-pen compatible, no s-pen included in/with phone, heats a lot when fast charging. No accesories available conpared to other device, ALL cases need some form of glue/tape to stay in place!!! and turns phone to 1/2 inch thick!.","September 5, 2023"

I couldn't get it to power down either.When I attempted to return, Amazon's return policy and Customer Service was the least helpful I've ever experienced, as I ordered a new Zfold 5, the return/refund policy would take a minimum of 2 weeks to receive, there was only one option to return product (pickup) which was 3 visits over 3 days, which I had to present for and no scheduled visit time, meaning I had to be home for up to 3 days without leaving.Additionally, I received notice from Amazon that it could take up to a full month to refund original refurbished price of approximately $1400. The resulting financial strain on my resources of covering both purchases for up to 7 weeks (still waiting on refund) when I've been a member of Amazon for over 10 years without any mishap.

The pros are that it's like having a tablet that you can carry around all day.  I love it, and that I can get so much work done on long subway trips.  If you are someone who has the time to sit and work while ""on the go"", you will love it.  I prefer to flip it sideways for better/wider viewing once it is open.  Past that, you have likely heard of the other pros.  As for the cons, this is not a phone to buy used.  I spend much of my year overseas and in Korea, where the various Folds and Flips have been out for several years.  I know several other business people with Fold 3's, 4's, and they are now getting the 5's.  I also know many young university students with Flip 3's, and 4's.  What you have to know about these phones is that the inner screen is incredibly fragile, as is the video transmission cable in earlier models.  They make a big deal about the hinge, but the real problems are with needing to replace the thin inner screen or possibly cable.  The factory screen protector needs occasional replacement (8 months shows bubbling on model 3's and some 4's), which means giving up your phone and waiting to have it done (or shipping out) and paying for it.  Then, in colder seasons, screens on model 3's have worn out inside of 1 to 2 years, or start to fray along the corners and at the hinge points. Model 4's a bit better, from what I am seeing.  Basically, know that you really should get Samsung Care with this phone, or plan to get rid of it by 1 to 2 years.  Otherwise, once you exceed the base screen warranty, you will pay a ridiculous amount to replace it.  Knowing this, it is just not a good ""long term"" phone for those who like to hold onto it for years and years.  Replacing that film may become prohibitively expensive or a hassle to keep up, if you don't have cheap/fast service nearby, and a full inner screen replacement is like buying a new phone if you don't have Samsung Care.  Likewise, the used value on the Fold phones is atrocious.  How bad?  In Korea, a 1-year old Fold 4 sells for $600 or less.  That's almost a 2/3 loss in value inside of a year!  The reason why is because anyone who purchases it used will have to worry about hundreds of dollars in inner screen replacements, ribbon cable fixing, and have absolutely no coverage for them.  Despite how awesome this phone is, I think it's development was Samsung attempting to create a device that can bring in more repair profit, and shoehorn users into paying for Samsung Care.  They want you buying new phones more often, buying additional warranties, or paying through the nose for repairs.  That's really what the Fold and Flip are about.  If you have the money to burn, and don't mind upgrading every year or investing in Samsung Care and keeping it a bit longer, this phone is incredible.  Case coverage and drop weight of the full phone is also difficult, leaving it damage prone.  Unless you can afford upgrading every 1 to 2 years -- avoid it.","October 10, 2023"

There are hundreds of people who give the fold phones a negative review because of the price and they don't see the benefit. However, if you are in the camp that sees a large near tablet size screen incorporated into a easily compacted device, then a fold phone has a purpose.I have owned the Fold 2, 3 and 4. Each year I get the next iteration as I love new cell phone technology. And, without hesitation, this is the best Samsung fold to date. There are plenty of reviews stating that the improvements are only incremental. But, incremental improvements are still improvements.I did consider the Pixel Fold. I was hesitant because Samsung has struggled to get the Fold phones to this level of quality. Even the Fold 4, a vast improvement to the Fold 3, was showing its age after only one year. The inner screen cover had separated and the somewhat wonky hinge design was becoming more irritating as other manufacturers had figured out how to make a hinge without a bump.I got my phone from Samsung, unlocked, 512GB. One thing Samsung does is give its loyal customers a huge discount. Between the buyback of the Fold 4, the early order discount, and other perks, the phone was in the $700 dollar range. They also sold a new slim case with an S pen for a large discount.The new phone is slimmer, lighter, and that annoying hinge bump is gone. It opens and closes with a satisfying motion. And, when closed, even with the S pen case, the new phone is slimmer than the old phone with a slim case.There are numerous reviews giving the specs and quality of the phone. From my point of view, the new benefits are:1.) It is slimmer, lighter and seems to have a more solid hinge.2.) The inner screen protector has supposedly been improved with a new glue. Time will tell.3.) The screen is bright. It is so bright that I routinely turn it down, even when outside.4.) A major problem with the old Fold phones is that there was no easy way to store the S pen. The new slim S Pen case is awesome. It is thin and the S Pen stay in a slot that does not make the back thicker or clunky. What Samsung did was to utilize the design that makes photo optics prominent in the back. They revised case, minimized the thickness of the S Pen, and made it fit in the space that is created by protruding thicker lenses.5.) Samsung does make it easy to switch phones. The Smart Switch moved all of my apps and settings. The only thing that is annoying is that all of the bluetooth settings need to be re-installed.6.) I like the narrow front screen. I agree with others that the narrow screen makes it difficult to type and it's not as big as a standard phone screen, like the Pixel Fold. However, the narrowness makes it easy to use one hand to check who's calling, review a message, and get a quick update on any app. If I need more detail, I open the phone and use the full size screen. Also, the Samsung screen, when opened, immediately resizes the app a full screen display. There is no need to rotate the phone as appears to be an issue with the Pixel Fold.If you are thinking of a Fold phone, this is the one to get. It took Samsung five tries, but this is the best one to date. It is refined to near perfection.","August 15, 2023"

Overall I like it but there are a few nagging issues worth mentioning. Sometimes when I press on the screen, nothing happens. It's like the phone isn't getting the signal. The other issue is getting bogged down on some social media sites like Facebook. Trying to move from one profile to another is already a challenge with the ridiculous interface that FB provides but on this phone the issue is just compounded.

After about a week I got the phone back and the wifi was fixed, but when I looked at the phone I saw a lot of scratches on the front display. The display protector had been on the phone since I bought it, and it was still on when I sent it to the Samsung repair center, but when I got it back, there was no screen protector on the phone.I immediately contacted the Samsung service center, and they said they were sorry and would fix it if I sent the phone back to them, so I sent it back to the repair center. A few days later, I got an email from them, and when I checked it, they wanted over $170 to replace the face display on the phone. Obviously, the repair center accidentally scratched a lot of scratches on my phone, and I was angry that they wanted money when I was still under warranty, so I called the service center and asked why they wanted money, and they connected me to the repair center and talked to the repair center supervisor. The supervisor of the repair center said that my phone had many scratches from the beginning, which is ridiculous, and demanded more than $170 to fix it. Despite my repeatedly explaining that my phone had a protective film on it and that there was no protective film when I received it, the samsung repair center manager kept repeating that there were many scratches on it from the beginning and that he could not fix it. In my opinion, Samsung is a company that thinks that it is enough to sell products. I told my friends about it, and they all cursed Samsung a lot. Don't buy any Samsung products.","September 3, 2023"

I upgraded from a Galaxy S20, so some of my comments will include that comparison.Pros:-MicroSD support! This is a requirement for me, and why I didn't really consider the S21 or S22.-Headphone jack! I missed it on the S20.-Replaceable battery! I hadn't had that since the LG G3.-Notification LED! I can't say I was conscious of missing it, and wasn't sure I'd use it. But it's nice to be able to see charge status or if I have a new notification from across the room.-Rugged, grippy build, with IP68. I actually like the plastic; I don't get the trend of slippery, fingerprint-magnet glass sandwiches (like the S20).-Very fast and reliable side-mounted fingerprint sensor. I hate the trend of in-display fingerprint sensors that are slow, unreliable, and leave a smudge on the screen. (The S20 is horrible about this.)-Gorilla Glass Victus+ for the display. It also has an excellent oleophobic coating - doesn't easily get smeared.-Snappy, smooth performance with the efficient Snapdragon 778G. Gets warm occasionally but not hot and doesn't throttle. I don't notice a performance difference compared to a flagship (but then I don't do benchmarks or heavy gaming). (The S20 got really hot and throttled.)-USB 3 with video out and Samsung Dex support. USB video out often isn't listed on specs sheets, but it's usually only on flagships, so it's nice to have it here.-Great battery life. I can easily get 2+ days despite the not-huge battery (4050 mAh).-The Wifi and LTE range and speed are noticeably better than on my S20! (My rural Verizon-partner carrier does not have 5G so I can't comment on that.)-Extra assignable keys-Reasonable price-Software support equivalent to flagships (month security updates,, 4 Android updates, 5 years of security updates)-Clear, sharp display without PWM according to notebookcheck - PWM is a dimming method that uses flicker. OLEDs and some LCDs use it - this doesn't - no flicker! So it's easier on the eyes than OLED if you're flicker-sensitive. I find it to be bright enough.Cons:-It is a rather big and heavy phone. Think S22 Ultra with a rugged case.-The display is LCD, not AMOLED, and according to notebookcheck, the color accuracy isn't great. I admit that the colors aren't as vibrant as AMOLED - they don't ""pop"" as much. But I like the display anyway, and as noted above, it's sharp and clear and without PWM.-Being LCD, there's also no Always-On Display. I adjusted by turning on Lift to Wake, plus the notification LED and really fast fingerprint sensor help.-It has a notch for the front camera. It's a small waterdrop notch, but it's still my first phone with a notch and I don't love it. With the big bezels Samsung could have put the camera in the bezel instead.-Big bezels (but I don't care).-According the specs the cameras aren't as good as on a flagship. But they're good enough for me.-Slow charging. 15W ""Fast Charging"" was fast 5 years ago with much smaller batteries. At least battery life is good, and charging doesn't make the phone hot, and the battery is changeable.-The built-in mono audio is okay, but certainly not premium. Still, I can hear and be heard clearly and the volume is fine. The S20 certainly has better audio. But my friend said he could hear me better when I was on the XCover6 than on the S20, so maybe it has a better mic. Or maybe it was the better Wifi performance.Other notes:This model - SM-G736U1, USA Unlocked - is not identical to the European models reviewed on notebookcheck and YouTube, or the specs listed on GSMArena. The network bands supported are different. Also, some reviewed models have dual SIM slots plus dedicated MicroSD. This model does not. It has one SIM slot, one MicroSD slot, and supports e-SIM.-It's hard to find a network bands list for the USA Unlocked model. I can confirm that it supports LTE Band 13, required for Verizon and Verizon partner support. I had to check this because a lot of Samsung Unlocked devices - like the A53 - do not support Band 13. My rural Verizon partner requires B13 and it works great. No 5G is available in my area so I don't know what it supports there.That's a lot, hope it's helpful. Though I wish it had faster charging, I'm very happy with this phone.","November 23, 2022"

No issues at all.Speaker is loud, so far my voice is clear to the other people I've spoken with and asked, Bluetooth works well and easily paired to my Sony headphones.Another PLUS is the 3.5mm jack! Bluetooth is a subpar quality of audio transmission to analog and I frequently use my studio headphones with my phone when checking mixes. Big kudos to keeping the 3.5mm jack alive!I used the camera and it seems fine...photos were clear and seemed to be balanced for indoors photos.Absolutely happy with my purchase.

The removable battery is a really cool and sadly uncommon feature, the camera is good enough, the functionality is great, and its also fairly rugged. But the screen broke on mine after several months of ownership when it fell on a metal coathanger, of all things. Ok. Had it replaced by a local shop. Great. All set. Worked for another few months. Then last week, out of the blue, the backlight dies. You can still barely see stuff on the screen (sometimes), but there's no lighting, so you cant really do anything with it. So I figure that the screen is shot (the backlight being part of the screen, after all) and order a replacement which I installed without issue. But the backlight still isn't illuminating the screen. A bit of research exposed that this is a known issue that Samsung refuses to address. Samsung tech support chat was utterly useless. Buy a new phone or send it in and pay them to maybe repair it the guy said... Screw it. I'll bring it to the local shop and see if they can fix it so I can have it as a backup, but I'm done with this thing as my everyday use phone. It's replacement is not another Samsung.

First off, all phones should have a replaceable battery (an easily replaceable battery I suppose I should say). Due to my last phone having one I was able to hold on to it for many years longer than my friends and family held on to theirs without one, so that was a must have. Secondly, it's a newer phone but still sports an external jack, another must have! It's lightning fast compared to my LG (but to be fair to my old LG, it Was old and pretty much maxed out on RAM), and it's fully customizable, which is always nice, and the battery charges super fast and so far, lasts super long! The speakers are loud and great too! My only critics are that it's rather large (even longer than my LG) & the fingerprint sensor isn't as friendly as my LG's was... but if you're looking for a capable android that will last a long time and won't break your wallet, I'd say this is the phone!","August 16, 2023"

Rooting the phone and removing the Samsung+Google bloatware/spyware was simple, as is the case for all the other Samsung devices I have owned. For $600 as of 12/2022, I am very happy.A note on carrier support: 4g functionality works on US domestic AT&T, 5g does not. When at the AT&T store they insisted this device would not work on their network AT ALL, but I insisted on getting a sim ""for my other phone"", and go figure, the xcover works fine with that sim.So unless you are one of those ""special"" people that needs to stream 4k video on the bus, this is a fully functional phone on AT&T, and I highly recommend it over every single other phone made after the 3G shutdown.PS, USBc charge brick is not included.","December 13, 2022"

I think it's a good enough smartphone.  I only use this smartphone for normal everyday use such as web browse, text message, and watch less than ten videos that are less than 15 minutes long per day.  The battery usually ends up at around 50% at the end of the day.  I only charge my phone to 85% and that is what I start with at the start of the day.Form factor:In regards to the form factor of the smartphone, I like the shape and it is super easy to handle compared to my old S20 Ultra 5G.  This fits so much easier in my pant pockets and jacket pockets.  I love that fact that I don't have to use a sim card ejector tool in order to install my sim card or microSD card because of the removeable back cover.  I love having removeable back cover.Camera:I love the fact that in normal camera mode the software makes the camera take super fast and in-focus pictures.  I think this is really convenience for people who want to take a quick photo and not have to change modes or have to deal with manual camera settings.  Easy to take a photo of items that I want to show to other people.Battery:Removeable!  I bought spares!Misc. complaints:I wish I can buy an accessory to charge my spare batteries to 85% or a desire capacity.","March 1, 2023"

Voice to text is all I use on this and all my Samsung devices, I can't text with my fingers for the life of me, it's way too time-consuming. As for Gboard, it works just fine on this phone but I prefer the Samsung keyboard. The only pet peeve I have so far with this phone is that the top and side key which provide the ability to Launch any app you choose including the flashlight will not turn on while the screen is off, i.e. the screen must be lit up in order for these key features to work which is counterproductive since the whole point of having these assigned keys are to Launch whatever you want quickly.

There is no setting for shaking your phone awake like my moto g power has. This phone also uses a microphone app that wont work w/ android 13 so no voice to text no matter what you do. Fast charging is slow af as well. Also hope you have a wall to usb c brick b/c this thing doesnt come w/ one. I should have bought a mototrola or fixed my current one.Golden lining is that the phone is super easy to work on and repair. I have not worked on mine but watched a lot of tear downs and read a lot of reviews. battery change in 5 minutes is pretty solid w/ no heat gun required. Also charging port and aux jack are daughter boards easy to replace w/ no soldering. Literally the only good things about this phone esp at this price point.If you are looking to deploy a fleet of them, you better know what you are doing, if my employer made me use one, i would look for another job.If you are a end user buying for personal use, just buy a moto g power 2022 and a heat gun.

This is a great Android cell phone, as it seems to have missed most of the consumer-hostile trends in the mobile phone industry.  Unlike most current devices, this one has a replaceable battery, headphone jack, and SD card slot.  It also seems to be well designed and durable.  It is exactly the phone that I wanted, and I have been very happy with it.My only major complaint with the device itself is that it ships without a manual or charging device.  A PDF of the manual is available for download, but, for $600, a printed copy should come with the device itself.  I have not been able to find a service manual for this anywhere, unfortunately.I ended up getting the Koamtac charging cradle (not the Xcover model on Amazon), which charges using the pogo pins on the base of the device.  It is expensive, but works well.There does seem to be an issue with parts availability for this model in the USA.  I wanted to get a spare back cover for mine.  This is part number GH98-47657A, but good luck buying one in the US.  Samsung support send me to Samsung Parts, which does not sell that part and sent me back to Samsung support, which was useless.  Why are these parts not available in a web store for easy purchase?  I ended up buying spares from a company in Belgium (with inflated shipping prices), but it seems nutty that genuine replacement parts seem to be unobtainium in the US through official channels.Anyway, this is a good product, but Samsung needs to provide a service manual and better parts support in the US.","April 7, 2023"

This went on-sale.  It's great for her needs.  The cameras do not work well at all in low light (in fact they need a lot of light).  Photos come out grainy in less than bright light.  But she's not going to be doing much of that.  Works great for calls, and for playing video- even though it's not stereo (but with headphones it is, and smartphone speakers are not aurally stereo- they're too close together to get a good stereo image).The screen is plenty good for most anyone's purposes.  Battery life also seems good (in the few days we've had this).  I just wish it had wireless charging.  But it does have NFC, and can screen-cast- which is great for her, though she needs help to do it.The USB interface is as fast as the one on my Note 10 (using a 10Gbps cable), which isn't to say it's that fast.  And it charges rapidly.It's water-resistant enough for snorkeling, so that won't be an issue- though I don't think she got her old phone wet, ever.  It's plenty loud enough for her needs.  I have already sat on it (on the seat of her wheeled walker) for about 10 minutes, and that didn't pose any problem at all.  I showed her that the screen is scratch-proof (by scraping it with a knife and an ice pick).  So it will hold up in her purse just fine.Once she got the hang of answering it, it's been great so far.

It's very fast and speaker calls sound very clear.  Signal reception also appears to be good.  You will need the IMEI number found on the box (if you can read it) or in settings/about phone to give to your cell provider for activation.  There are TWO IMEI codes provided. The holder for SIM and Micro SD cards is very flimsy.  Use great care when removing and installing cards.  The SIM slot beside the SD slot, uses the IMEI number for SLOT 1.  Knowing this information may save you a headache, when you call your provider to set-up your new phone registration.  One nice feature is the ability to use the volume bar to answer calls and the power button to end calls.  This can come in handy when driving or where daylight is too bright to see the screen. Another good feature is EASY MODE which makes icons and print easier to see.","November 15, 2022"

Not gonna pay $800+ for a giant phone with way more features than I need, and not gonna go with an inexpensive, off-brand phone either. Found the A23 and the reviews looked promising, especially when it was on sale.Setting up the phone and getting the apps copied over was easy - I assume I got lucky sticking my SIM card in the correct slot. Had to re-do a few log-ins as I could not copy some accounts over from the old phone. Fingerprint reader works well enough, although it was tedious to get my finger scanned all the way.It has taken me a while to get used to the newer version of Android, and a few things are annoyingly over-complicated, compared to the old phone, but I'll get used to it. Performance and call quality are good, and the 5G screams. I typically get home from work with at least 75% battery left -- which is much better than the LG phone, even when it was new.Sadly, the camera resolution is poor - digital zoom gets grainy pretty fast, and zooming / cropping a 1x photo shows this as well. However, the macro and portrait features are nice, and do take good photos. The flash feature is kinda weird -- even if you turn it off, it may still come on if the overall picture area is dark.Overall, I'd say this is a good phone for kids / seniors / frugal folks -- good performance, battery life, speaker volume, and screen brightness. I wish it was a tad smaller -- but unless I want to go to the dark side (smaller iPhone), I'll have to get used to it.","December 3, 2022"

I understand the newest ones are phasing out these features.  It also mirrors to smart tv's.  Of course, the camera is pretty great too.  I highly recommend this phone.","February 8, 2023"

The reception is great, the opening of sites and uploads is quick, it takes great pictures and the battery life lasts for over three days.  My old Motorola only lasted half a day, so this is amazing!  The only thing I'm not crazy about is having to enter a pin number or a fingerprint to open the phone to use it.  I know it's for security, but I didn't have that on my old phone, so this is new to me.","May 8, 2023"

I have tried NINE different texting apps, & NONE work. I can use FB, Messenger, surf the web, etc., but can't send a text that is longer than a few lines, send a pic, screenshot, etc....which I never realized I did until I suddenly could NOT with this phone.I have put my SIM card back into my 5 YO phone, & it works PERFECTLY for tects. wifi calling, etc.I would NOT purchase this nor any Samsung until this issue is fixed.

YouTube even has a built in mode that turns the bottom half into the video controls!- The springs don't drag it open or close like my flip, so I can stand it at almost any angle!- materials make it feel premium! Samsung put a lot of effort into perfecting the foldable feeeling of quality. I also own an S24 ultra and they feel almost identical in terms of trust I have in the physical design and materials. Extremely well machined!- using the outside screen doesn't feel terrible and cramped as I had expected. It's a lot like when I got my flip and thought it was weirdly tall, but I got used to it.- ecosystem integration is finally to a point I can recommend people get everything Samsung, like the watch, ring, and tablets! Copy and paste works, if I need to open a message on my phone from my watch, I can immediately just open my phone, copy an OTP, etc.Ehhh:- Battery life is middling, it will last you all day, BUT with low-medium use. I am in a job where I use it around 4 hours a day and it struggles to be at even 20% at the end of my day.- Samsung bloatware is Mostly removable, I miss my pixel phones with completely uninstallable to no bloatware. I hate that we have non-uninstallabke bloatware like AR camera or Bixby (Google assistant FTW)Cons:- app support is getting closer to being more widespread but still not where it needs to be, some apps have issues with both the external and internal display ratios, whether it be too skinny to display things, or too wide to display things properly.- front/internal camera is terrible, it is taking a picture through the screen, but it is simply unacceptably bad- Brightness of the screen is not enough for outdoor use. I went to a local restaurant today and noticed I could barely see the screen with extra brightness enabled in overcast weather.Overall 8.5/10TL:DRPhysical design is impeccable, however software support and battery life hold it back from being what Samsung envisions: the perfect compact phone. 8.5/10","July 28, 2024"

Davis,4.0,"The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 improves upon that of its predecessor. Its refined, sharper, and lighter. The model design is a little bit longer and following the design choice of the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. However there is so things it could improve of on the future. The first thing is the phone isn't the smartest software wise with autocorrect. I am hoping with the next One UI update it receives an adequate update. But the biggest fix for the future would be, the design. Don't get me wrong its absolutely stunning in pink and screen quality however, the body design makes it difficult to hold. On countless times since it's delivery, it has dug into my skin and left indentions. So if holdability is important you may want to consider that. Other than that, the phone is stunning!

My primary phone is a Samsung Galaxy S22 and it's been so great I was expecting to keep stay with that phone for year but the opportunity to check this one out arose.Goods:This is a very high quality phone. The build is great, it's slim, has a satisfying hinge close, solid quality speakers, screens look great, and I can go on. It's obviously got all the new bells and whistles in there. Galaxy AI is the new thing with it. It includes translation features, summarizing websites, notes assist with formatting/decorating, and photo/drawing assists. They seem to work fine but honestly not game changing in terms of day to day use. The massive folding screen is cool. It's got a function where if it's like half open you can use the bottom part as a mousepad+other functions and the top part as your screen. Not all apps support it very well but most basic ones I've used work fine. I really don't have any faults with the features and the overall quality of the phone, it's great which it should be for being nearly 2k. That's where I get to my criticisms.Downsides:So it's hard for me to to give this a full 5 stars for a couple reasons. For the cost of this device I expect a little more. It's got many features and functions to work with an S pen but somehow does not come with one. Doesn't even come with a holder for one. It doesn't come with a power brick either, not a huge deal for me but for 2k? Even just a screen protector for the front screen would've been nice. Come on. Yes I am being picky and honestly if you are looking at a phone that costs this much you probably don't care to spend a little more on an S pen and case with holder but I just had to put it out there. Another point, as someone who isn't an artist or doesn't power use their phone I don't see myself getting the full use of a giant screen like this. I can see drawing and taking notes, which would be nice with an s pen... but there are videos which do look nice on the big screen.While my large ""downsides"" section seems to make it look like I don't like this phone, in reality I do because it's a great phone. I love that the single main screen is super functional as a regular phone then I can open it up for big screen movies or videos. I can't in good conscious give this phone any lower than a 4 since there are really no issues with the phone itself, just the value and what's included in the box.Overall, this phone isn't for everyone or even for most people I'd say but if you think that it would be a good fit for you then you will not be disappointed. I would definitely recommend this phone to people who could get good use out of a phone like this!","July 31, 2024"
"SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Fold 6 AI Cell Phone, 512GB Unlocked Android Smartphone, Circle to Search, Handsfree Live Interpreter, AI Photo Edits, Large Screen, 2024,US 1 Yr Manufacturer Warranty, Navy",S. Davis,4.0,"This is Samsung’s flagship phone and I had to give it a try. I thought this would be overly bulky to hold and carry but it is not bad at all. The biggest difference is the thickness. Samsung has  made the cover screen slightly larger than on the Fold 5 and it is very usable. Sure, it is narrower than most standard phones, but this make for easy one handed use. I also find the squared off corners more appealing than the more rounded ones on the Fold 5.  The main inside screen is fantastic. Super sharp and bright. The crease is noticeable but I do not find it intrusive. This screen is great for streaming videos. The biggest advantage is the way you can have several apps displayed at once for multitasking. Battery life is sufficient. I am new to this phone so have been playing with it a lot. I can still get pretty much a whole day’s usage without charging. Charging is decently fast but not as good as some competitors. Considering this is Samsung’s top phone, I wish they would have provided a bigger battery with quicker charging.  The processor is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 so performance, as expected is quick and snappy. In fact, I have changed the performance profile in settings to light as opposed to standard and have not noticed a decrease in performance. This did increase battery life which was a nice plus. The cameras (5 of them) are acceptable. The main cameras, a 50mp main camera, a 10mp, 3X optical zoom telephoto, and a 12mp ultra wide take very good photos. The phone also has a 10mp selfie camera on the cover screen and a 4mp camera on the main screen when opened. As I said, the cameras are acceptable but given the price of this phone, Samsung could do better. Their competition has.  This phone comes with the usual Samsung bloatware, but also has an impressive array of AI features. I find the translating apps especially impressive. Some of the AI features are really neat (circle to search, sketch to image, portrait studio) but not something I would use on a daily basis. More of something to wow your friends with.  Overall, I am very happy with this phone. I am sure the more I use it, the more great features I will find. However, at a price of $1899, I feel Samsung could have done better. Especially the camera and the battery and charging. This super expensive phone will certainly not be for everyone, but if you multi task a lot, have to have the latest and greatest tech, and can find a good deal out there with trade ins, it could be for you.","July 30, 2024"
"SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Fold 6 AI Cell Phone, 512GB Unlocked Android Smartphone, Circle to Search, Handsfree Live Interpreter, AI Photo Edits, Large Screen, 2024,US 1 Yr Manufacturer Warranty, Navy",Frank in PA.,4.0,"This is a pretty solid phone with the interesting folding gimmick. The price point feels a bit high when compared to other phones on the market, but it works great and is very responsive. The new biometrics reader on the side was a bit of a surprise at how well it works and the camera is really nice, all of them, btw. The unfolded screen becomes large enough that you start seeing ""desktop"" resolution settings for website layouts, or you can dock apps to each half and run multiple at the same time, which is cool. You can't use the front screen with the inner screen, but that makes sense. I do find myself gravitating towards the front more often for quick things, but if I'm interested I'll open it up and the transition is pretty seamless.It supports a pen, but doesn't have any way to store it. There's no wall charger, just the cord as well.","August 14, 2024"
"SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Fold 6 AI Cell Phone, 512GB Unlocked Android Smartphone, Circle to Search, Handsfree Live Interpreter, AI Photo Edits, Large Screen, 2024,US 1 Yr Manufacturer Warranty, Navy",Robby,5.0,"I've been using this phone exclusively for over a week now. The setup was easy and fun (switched from my S22 Ultra and transferred over my settings). I also got the S Pen case, which I've been enjoying since the S pen on the inner screen is pretty useful. Here have been my experiences so far:Overall:An amazingly powerful phone that's fast, fun, unique, powerful, and has very few downsides compared to a 'regular' slab phone.Look and feel:I think it looks incredible, both the designs and the screen. It feels a little heavy when closed, but almost like magic it feels very lightweight when open due to the large screen size. The front screen is thin and tall, but I actually enjoy that because it's easy to type one-handed. The screens are extremely bright and at the right angle the crease on the inner screen virtually disappears.Performance:This thing is FAST! No lag, very smooth (I changed my animations to 0.5x in developer settings to make it feel snappier).Battery:Better than expected. I'm getting more hours out of this than my S22 Ultra, even though I'm using this phone more and often have it open to use the large screen.Cameras:Overall, it takes good pictures. The one area where it doesn't keep up with other flagship Samsung phones is the zoom. If you're coming from any phone 2+ years old, it'll probably still be an overall upgrade.Features:Way more than any other phone that I'm aware of. Samsung's ecosystem is now bigger and better than Apple's in my opinion, it works great with Windows, it makes excellent use of the large inner screen, the S pen is very handy, the fingerprint scanner works great, etc. etc.Surprises:I don't like the inner camera that 'disappears' when you're not using it. I think the pixelation over the small cutout is more distracting than if it were just a cutout. Luckily, this can be turned off in the Goodlock app.The fingerprint scanner works great, and I actually thought I'd like the location better, but I think I prefer the under-display scanner on the S22 Ultra in terms of location vs the power button.The weight doesn't bother me, and it often feels smaller in my pocket even though it's thicker than most phones.Wireless charging still works well with the S pen case, which is great!","August 8, 2024"
"SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Fold 6 AI Cell Phone, 512GB Unlocked Android Smartphone, Circle to Search, Handsfree Live Interpreter, AI Photo Edits, Large Screen, 2024,US 1 Yr Manufacturer Warranty, Navy",Robby,5.0,"-----  SUMMARY  -----Verdict:The Galaxy Z Fold 6 is a top-of-the-line foldable phone with a stunning design, powerful performance, and a versatile camera system. I think it’s the best foldable phone on the market, but its high price tag and bulky form factor may not be for everyone.Pros:  -  Stunning design  -  Powerful performance  -  Versatile camera system  -  Long battery life  -  Unique features that take advantage of the foldable designCons:  -  High price tag  -  Bulky form factor  -  Camera not as powerful as some other premium phones-----  DETAILS  -----Design:The Galaxy Z Fold 6 looks like any other regular phone when it's closed. It has squared edges that remind me of the Galaxy S24 Ultra, which I like. When I use the cover screen, I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything because I have full access to all the phone's features, regardless of which screen I'm using.On the right edge, you'll find a volume rocker and the power button, which also serves as a fingerprint sensor. I was initially worried about how well the fingerprint sensor would work because it's so small, but it turns out to be one of the best I've used on a phone. There's a USB-C port at the bottom and speaker grilles at the top and bottom. There's also a SIM tray, but the phone supports eSIM as well.The build quality of the Galaxy Z Fold 6 is top-notch. It's clear that this is a well-made device that's worth its premium price tag. The tablet-sized 7.6-inch internal screen is the standout design feature, and it doesn't disappoint. The display is sharp and vibrant, and I barely notice the crease when I'm using it straight on. At an angle, you can definitely tell it's there, but that's the case with any foldable phone.The Z Fold 6's bulk and weight are its main drawbacks. While Samsung has done an impressive job making it more compact than its predecessors, it's still noticeably thicker and heavier than most other smartphones on the market. This is inherent to foldable phones due to their dual screens and complex hinge mechanisms. If you're considering purchasing the Z Fold 6, I highly recommend trying it out in a store first to ensure you're comfortable with its size and weight before making a decision.Features:AI is all the rage in tech these days, and Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 6 is no exception. One feature that I've had a blast playing with is Sketch to Image. You can use the Samsung Notes app to sketch something and have AI turn it into a pro-looking image. There are lots of styles to choose from, like watercolor or 3D cartoon. I've been seriously impressed with the results. Another cool thing you can do with Sketch to Image is take a photo and draw on it, then bring your creation to life. I'm not exactly an artist, but the Sketch to Image feature still manages to make some pretty cool illustrations and pics.Portrait Studio is another fun one. You can turn your selfies into paintings, sketches, or 3D cartoons. The results can be a bit unpredictable. Sometimes they're amazing, and sometimes they're a little, well, unflattering or unrecognizable. But it's still a pretty cool feature.One feature that I've tried out that takes advantage of the Galaxy Z Fold 6's unique foldable design is conversation mode in the Interpretor app. It shows translated text on both the outward-facing cover screen and the inner screen. This lets two people having a conversation see the translations at the same time, all while just holding the phone in one spot. I can totally see this being useful when I go on my international travels, which I'm hoping to do soon.These are just a few of the standout features that I wanted to mention. There are a bunch of other features from Samsung or Google built into the phone, and you can always access Google Gemini with a swipe from the corner. What I'd love to see is more features like conversation mode in Interpretor that use both screens. That would make the Z Fold 6 an even more compelling choice.Performance:The Z Fold 6 has been an exceptional performer. I haven't encountered any lag, even when multitasking or running demanding applications. From casual browsing to video editing and graphically intensive games, the Z Fold 6 handled everything with ease. While it does warm up slightly during particularly intense tasks, it never becomes excessively hot to the touch. In normal usage scenarios, it maintains a comfortable temperature. You can expect consistently smooth graphics and rapid performance from the Z Fold 6, making it an ideal device for both work and entertainment.Camera:The Z Fold 6 features a versatile triple-lens rear camera system. The 50-megapixel main camera captures stunning, detailed shots with vivid colors. The 12-megapixel ultrawide lens is perfect for expansive landscapes and group photos, offering a broader perspective. The 10-megapixel telephoto lens provides a respectable 3x optical zoom, allowing you to get closer to distant subjects without sacrificing image quality. While it may not have the 5x optical zoom of the Galaxy S24 Ultra and iPhone 15 Pro Max, the Z Fold 6's camera still excels in capturing sharp and vibrant images. Overall, the Z Fold 6's camera is well-equipped to handle various photography scenarios, making it a reliable choice for mobile photography enthusiasts.Battery Life:The Z Fold 6 can easily last an entire day. Even when I use it heavily, doing things like using GPS, streaming music, and taking photos, I still usually have more than 20% of my battery left at the end of the day. However, the key factor that affects battery life is how much you use the internal screen. If I use the internal screen for content like watching YouTube videos, the battery drains much faster than when doing other tasks. Despite this, the battery life hasn't let me down.","September 1, 2024"
"SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Fold 6 AI Cell Phone, 512GB Unlocked Android Smartphone, Circle to Search, Handsfree Live Interpreter, AI Photo Edits, Large Screen, 2024,US 1 Yr Manufacturer Warranty, Navy",Range Finder,5.0,"I have been using Samsung phones since the Note 3 and I very rarely upgrade once I get used to a phone. Before switching to this I had been using the Samsung Note 9  for years as it had great features that were hard to beat from even the newer models. This device however is the exception to that rule.Going from a single screen phone to this amazing multi screen foldable was to me night and day. My vision is not the best so I normally get the larger screen phones to assist in that regard. Not counting all the other features that I am loving, just being able to flip open the phone into a much larger tablet like screen is so helpful. Unless looking at the screen from an angle I can barely even notice the crease in the center of the foldable screen and as for touch its only noticeable when using an s-pen.Coming from the Note 9 the front screen was a little narrower but not by much. This device doesn't have those beveled screen edges so you get more room for the actual screen. Having the the fingerprint scanner on the side makes it much easier to unlock single handedly as well.As for the cameras, coming from an older model these things blow my mind. They can take such clear pictures even in lower light situations. There are three that come with this phone and each has there own boons.The speed of the device is also a great improvement from my old phone. I am able to quickly navigate apps as well as play games without any issues. The device keeps up with multiple tasks running without any performance degradation.Overall I am blown away with how this tech has advanced and loving this new device. I have only had this for a about a week so far and will update this review if anything changes.","July 29, 2024"
"SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Fold 6 AI Cell Phone, 512GB Unlocked Android Smartphone, Circle to Search, Handsfree Live Interpreter, AI Photo Edits, Large Screen, 2024,US 1 Yr Manufacturer Warranty, Navy",Range Finder,4.0,"TLDR: An improvement in almost every possible way, and worth the upgrade (if the price isn't too much or a hurdle.)My original review of the Fold3 surmised that I loved the device, but would only recommend it to those who had a clear need for the interior ""main"" display; those who frequently watch movies/TV, play games, or (like me) like to read manga/manhua on the go. I think most of this is still true, but Samsung has made such significant changes in terms of ""usability"" that this is now a much easier recommendation, to even those who may only use the main display once or twice a day at most, possibly only a few times a week. The biggest change is how one-hand-friendly the device has become; cutting the weight by 12% and thinning the bezels down to the point that the outer screen just feels like a regular (albeit thinner) phone. It used to be I would try and use the outer display with one hand, but would often use two because the heft left me feeling a bit insecure (just physically, emotionally that's always been true.) This is now a thing of the past being lighter than ever, but also the hinge now has a matte texture instead of glossy; a small change that gives my fingers a better feel they have total control over the device as I grip it, to the point that I don't think I'll be putting a case on it (something I tried on the 3, but got tired of after a while.) The interior display is the same size it has been, but now that the screen-to-body ratio is tighter with smaller bezels, the whole device has become tangibly smaller, making ""pocketability"" so much easier. Which is also nice with its improved ""flatness"" when folded, as I have noticed less dust getting into the crease as compared to my 3.But there are still a couple weird things to note; the camera, and the phone's ""sharpness."" The phone overall has become thinner and folds slimmer, but the camera bezels are so much larger/more pronounced that the phone is still technically the same thickness. Its like the phone phone was shaved down around the camera, and they forgot to go back and finish. This isn't a huge issue, but you definitely notice is when you pick it up/grab it in your pocket. Speaking of grabbing it, if you have incredibly soft hands watch out, you might cut yourself on these edges. Yes that's a joke, but it doesn't change just how angular this phone feels. I guess 90° angles are ""in""? The phone looks very nice with its clean angled edges, but in practice I'd be lying if I said I never got tired of holding this phone for extended periods of time (something that while writing, I realized does mean I should make this a 4/5 rating.) This feels like a case of ""form over function,"" which is something I've long hated because if you make something more unpleasant to use just to look better, that to me is a tradeoff not worth making.But the main question will always be: How long will the folding screen last? As seen, my Fold3 interior display did get small hairline fractures all along the hinge after being folded and unfolded so many times. Thing is, they didn't start until about 1.5 years into use, and as long as whatever I was viewing wasn't a purely white screen, they were easily missed unless laser-focused on. Hopefully with development this newest version will last longer than ever, but I will update this as soon as it starts to degrade. So if you're thinking about upgrading from a couple generations ago I do think this is a vastly improved device, and would recommend it. If you're looking to get into the ""foldable"" market I think this is a great entry point, and even if you don't fall in love with the interior display, the outer one is so good you may not even care, especially now that the phone folds almost perfectly flat with those thinner bezels. This continues to be an incredible device for people like me who used to carry a tablet for movies and reading, and will continue to be my go-to device until someone makes a phone that unfolds even larger (I miss my 10in tablet screen.) If it wasn't for the squared-off edges I'd feel completely safe giving this a perfect 5/5, but it is still a very recommendable device at a 4/5, since I'd give it a 4.5/5 if I could.","August 2, 2024"

The base model with 256GB of storage, 12GB RAM, and in silver finish. The phone operates on latest OneUI 6.1, Android 14. This phone has Samsung's 'AI' features. The battery is 4400mAh.In hindsight, I would have preferred the 512GB version, for the extra storage...which is currently selling for less.The initial impressions of the new model Z Fold 6 is WOW! It's pretty fast, the multiple screens are great, and I was planning to get a tablet but no longer need to thanks to the size of the folder. I'm still setting up the phone's configuration, and service. So, I will have updates as they materialize. I will be testing with eSIM and standard SIM. And hotspot WiFi operations. As a photographer, I'm excited with the powerful photo camera features of this model.The form factor is excellent. How thin it is folded is impressive. The hinge is much improved to be more rigid and strong. But a protective case must be acquired for it.  The next gen Z Fold 6 is a recommend and thumbs up! But go for the 512GB model.","August 20, 2024"

The moment you unfold that massive screen, it's like discovering a whole new world of possibilities. It's like having a mini-tablet in your hand. Watching movies or playing games on it is a totally different experience. The display is absolutely stunning, with vibrant colors and incredible detail. It also feels a lot more durable than I had expected in a folding screen (although I'd still be extremely cautious and considering a case!)All of the cameras are top-notch, capturing every moment in stunning clarity even at high speeds or dim lighting.I'm enjoying the new ""circle it"" feature too, though I bet we'll see that on other less expensive phones soon enough (as we are seeing with Gemini becoming more ubiquitous across Androids).It's a premium device, though, and the price reflects that. It's a lot to swallow, even for someone who likes their gadgets. You really gotta decide if the extra features are worth the extra cash.","August 9, 2024"

I switched to iPhone and never went back.  However, after hearing all the hype about the Z fold, I wanted to give it a try.  My review will compare my current iPhone 15 pro to the Z fold 6Overall Impression: Z fold 6 is a clear winnerThe Z fold connects to WiFi much faster, pulls higher down speeds and maintains a steadier connectionThe Z fold offers a better gaming experience on the goThe Z fold is a little bulkier, however not as much as you would think for a phone that is also a tabletThe iPhone does offer a bit smoother of a transition between appsGetting used to the switch has taken some time.  Adding a case to the Z Fold does make it a bit bulkier than it already is, but with the price, I wouldn’t chance not having a case.The phone lacks a storage spot for an S pen so you will need a case if you want to use the S pen with the Fold 6.Overall, I am glad I switched and can’t wait to see what else this phone can offer","July 25, 2024"

If you find yourself already using multiple apps on the screen at the same time then you're going to LOVE the multi apps features. I use multiple PDFs and emails on the screen at once, and love how much more productive I'm able to be while on one device. It kinda becomes a mobile work station for me. I can't speak about durability yet, but the build quality seems solid! Everything is aligned perfectly on mine, I know others have had some quality issues so far though. Battery is lasting about 8 hours using the main screen during sunny parts of the day, on 5G, and downloading stuff so pretty much max usage. Temperature on mine stays really cool.

The screen is super clear even in direct sunlight and collects very few fingerprints (its like sorcery). The screen refresh rate also lends itself well to make the phone feel snappy and smooth. It's honestly heaven in my hands. The fast charging is a must, but fast wireless charging is even better. In glass finger print sensor is fast and accurate, you just have to get used to where it is (way better than face ID. However, the battery life is a little short (for heavy loads), but fast charging more for makes up for it. I considered getting the Ultra, but this phone exceeded my expectations in every way. The law of diminishing returns plagues the Ultra waaay too much.

I have been a Samsung user for years and loved every phone from galaxy s4 through to my previous galaxy note 8.  The S21 was very sluggish with every action. It was as if it disconnected constantly from celluar and wifi and you had to wait 20 seconds or more for it to 'wake up' to do anything.  Within weeks it began to malfunction and freeze up. I constantly kept having to restart in safe mode. I eventually had to erase all data and ultimately attempt several factory resets. After several tech calls with amazon repeating the same troubleshooting steps, the last resort was to take it to an authorized repair service 30 miles away from me. However after working with the repair service they said it likely needed the mother board replaced. The Amazon customer service said it was clear it was faulty and to return it...I would be fully refunded and then I could buy it again. Well they refunded me $100 less than I paid without explanation. When I inquired they claimed it had been returned outside the 30 day window and this was a restock fee. I am now protesting this as I spent hours and weeks trying to get the phone to work before returning it. Trust me....this phone has major glitch issues. I also advise you save your money and sanity and NEVER buy a high end product from AMAZON.  I can accept that sometimes a product just is faulty but this issue was amplified by the Amazon customer service methods and refund policies. The headache and hassle I've been through has been exhausting. If you do order from them I suggest you save copies of the order details page and all chat history if you ever want your money back.  I've asked my issue be escalted to a manager but in the meant time because of this fiasco I have had to buy a lesser phone as I'm out $100 not to mention the case, pop socket and screen protector i got for the S21 that is wasted now! :(","July 14, 2021"

Glad I grabbed the 256gb I guess, but with no expansion storage option, will it make my new phone obsolete faster?Next, I need to set up my fingerprint scanner. Always traveling & on the go, slightly running my finger along the power button on my S10e cut down on time & effort swiping or entering a pin or pattern. Every app used my fingerprint to log in, unlocking the screen was a breeze... not anymore. Instead of the first try unlocking the phone, it sometimes takes multiple attempts. Prompting to ""press harder"" or ""cover the entire sensor"". The sensor is built into the lower portion of the screen. No easy way to gauge that your thumb is centered on it each time. I found it so frustrating I resorted to face recognition & a pin lock & swipe so essentially downgrading the convenience. I have since retried after a software update and adding a fingerprint sensor compatible screen protector and its 100% unusable now.Battery life is better than my 3 year old S10e, but not by a drastic amount.Camera function & quality is overhyped. I can get a wider shot on the S21 and nice HDR images, but I strongly feel anything in low light is much more grainy than my S10e was. I feel they barely upgraded the image sensor on the S21 to save on costs. This is also apparent with the phone pretty much only including the phone in the box. No charger, screen protector, or form of headphones as previous flagship S series phones included.My banking app does not work on the S21. It says I have an autoclicker app installed and closes. Bank claims it's the new phone, Samsung claims it's the banking app. Works on my S10e, reset the S21 to default and installed just my banking app..still doesn't work.Performance-wise I'm not able to see a difference with any of the apps or games I've used on both phones. Maybe that will be more apparent in the future as processing demands increase across apps.Do I regret my purchase? Yes. But if you are coming from any phone that is less than an S9 you'll probably see a noticeable upgrade. S21 is a misleading name, I'd consider it more of an S10.5 5G if anything.. and that's being nice about it.","July 15, 2021"

New problem: My SIM card doesn't work. I am taking it to MetroPCS to see if I can get help. This whole process has been difficult. I was really hoping to just pop the SIM in and start using right away. Disappointing.I was super excited to get this phone because I have never had an S series Galaxy phone before. When I opened the box it would not turn on. It didn't come with a charger and I did not own one so I had to wait for one to arrive in the mail because no store had them in stock near me. Finally plugged it in and nothing happens. Even the phone store I took it to couldn't figure it out. Amazon is sending me a replacement and I'll update my review once I actually get to use the phone.

"Samsung Galaxy XCover Pro | Rugged (IP68 Rated) Unlocked (Verizon and AT&T) | Dual Sim | 64GB of Storage | SM-G715UZKDXAA, Black",T. L. Fulton,5.0,"I've been going through a lot of phones lately. I live a rugged lifestyle: construction, farming, hunting, camping... I need a phone that can take a tumble or two. The last phone I had like that was a Samsung J7, a strong phone that lasted a long time, but is out dated because it only has 16 gig ROM—towards the end I was switching between apps by uninstalling one and reinstalling the other. This phone has 64, which is plenty for me, since I found the SD slot—the two SIM bays threw me off for a minute, those little things can be tough to see: the SD slot is on top of SIM 1, which is the SIM slot you want to use for the States.Anyway, ever since they started putting the fingerprint scanner under the screen, it seems the screen has become super fragile, and now when you break it, it doesn't just crack and you can still use it, it completely craps out and your phone is now useless. Mind you, every phone I purchase is bought with tempered glass screen protectors at the same time, which is installed immediately upon removing the phone from its packaging, the moment the protective film is removed from the screen a tempered glass screen cover is the next thing to touch it. The last time I didn't have the screen protector when the phone arrived, I left the protective film on the phone and used it like that until the protectors arrived. My old J7 would look a total shattered mess, and I'd peel off the screen protector and it'd look like a bran new phone underneath, and a new protector would be put right back on. I swore by them, but they don't protect the new phones like they did my J7, and I really think it's the stuff they put behind the screen now.This is probably why this phone has the fingerprint scanner on a side button, which I love, because it's way more accurate (probably due to the glass shields), and because it's more accessible: I can reach it with my left middle finger if I'm holding it in my left hand, or with my right thumb if I'm holding it in my right. The on screen readers often took me two hands to operate, this one I can easily work with one, making this phone so much easier for me to get into.Also, I love the two added programmable buttons, a great feature to have for people who frequently wear gloves, you can program these buttons for easy access to things like your phone dialer or camera, even if your phone is still locked, if you choose that option.Android 10 is incredibly customizable and full of features, and this is a standard Samsung phone in that it gives you full access to these features and runs the operating system well. I told you I've broken a lot of phones lately, some phones I can compare this to are the Samsung A20 and A51, and moto z4. The A20 had a power port failure on like day two, the rest were all broken screens. Those phones I think are designed more for office type workers or those in medical field and such, I think. They have a nice sleek design and their screens go to the edge of the phone or even wrap around. This phone's screen doesn't go to the edge, and is slightly recessed, which makes me feel it's better protected from a fall on its face. This makes the screen protector fit flush in the recess, but I'm disappointed that it does not fit snug. That's a separate review for the screen protector, I don't fault the phone for that. This phone is a little bit bulkier (thicker) and I suppose heavier than those sleeker designs, but I'm more comfortable with it in my hands and it definitely feels sturdier.I loved removing the cover and seeing the battery! I've missed being able to change batteries when I go on a long trip into the woods for a campout, and want to take photos or use Google Earth, or track a hike... I hope to be able to purchase a backup soon.It would be nice to have a phone again that outlasts it's specs. If this phone holds up for me as well as the J7 did, I'll be happy. If not, I will update my review.","October 30, 2020"
"Samsung Galaxy XCover Pro | Rugged (IP68 Rated) Unlocked (Verizon and AT&T) | Dual Sim | 64GB of Storage | SM-G715UZKDXAA, Black",T Kebbe,5.0,"Yada yada yada, this phone, that phone, all kinds of phones everywhere you turn - you get so bombarded with cell phone ads and commercials it becomes obnoxious. What sold me on this phone is the incredibly easy to remove / replace battery which you just can't find much of anymore. All of these new phones do not particularly serviceable batteries, so what happens after a 1000 charge cycles? If you want to keep a phone for years to come, this is it. When they say BEAST, it truly is in everyway. While it is not a slim small phone that you could forget in your pants pocket and accidentally end up in the washing machine, it is not overbearingly large or heavy. This IS definitely a commercial heavy duty grade phone. I put what I considered to be an enormous 256gb micro SD card in it, so along with the 60GB it already has built into it, it now has more space available in it than my laptop PC does. Yes, there are no particular instructions that come with this phone, but it is truly rather intuitive to learn to use. Battery life has been amazing. Reception has been amazing, even in the metal building I work in that is usually dicey for reception at best under any carrier. There is such a dramatic leap in technology with this phone that I am actually stunned - Android 10 is very well done. It is not listed as 5G, but I wouldn't be one bit surprised if it gets a software update at some point and magically meets the new mark. As it is, it downloads things and plays HD videos so quickly and smoothly that I wouldn't likely even be able to tell the difference if it switched to 5G.So I receive the phone, a little anxious about whether I can just swap in my Verizon SIM card out of my old phone and go. Ooops... Apparently SIM cards got smaller when I wasn't looking - DOH! NANO SIM cards now? Ok, so I have apparently been living under a rock. My older SIM was too big to fit. I hopped online and researched it, and what do you know, you can actually see a ton of online tutorials as to how to simply trim your older / larger SIM card down to the new NANO size - interesting. I ordered a new replacement NANO SIM from Verizon at no charge, but it will take a few days to get here. Anxious to try this bad boy phone out, I nervously trimmed my SIM card down with scissors, sanded the plastic side down a bit, and popped it right in. Not sure if I had possibly wrecked the SIM card, and also not sure if Verizon would accept the phone without a fight, I powered it up, went through the initial on screen set up prompts, and BAM - up and running perfectly (standard personal Verizon account - not commercial or prepaid). I transferred all of my data from my old phone to the new phone using the Wondershare Mobile Trans software I have installed on my PC, and everything transferred over perfectly - hooray!Now what they aren't advertising much just yet is that this phone has a dual sim card capability - wow. I haven't tested it yet, but am going to yank the SIM card out of my wife's Verizon phone and pop it into the the slot labeled ""SIM 2"". There was some mention that this feature is coming soon via a software update, but who knows - maybe that day has already come? I am VERY curious to see what it does with two SIM cards in it, speculating that it will act like a ""Line 1 or Line 2"" phone. WAAAAAAAY back in the early days, I had a Sprint phone that ran two lines. I ran a business line and also a personal line on that phone - I sure have missed that capability since then. If this works and I have two lines, I may try one of those companies like Cricket to provide a low cost second line. Again, I haven't tested this yet, but I'll bet you it works, which will tickle me silly for my business and personal usages.It has only been a few days now, but I am beyond tickled with this phone. I took a bit of a gamble on it, seeing some reviews that ranged from soup to nuts. The outcome? Tickled silly :)  BIG SCREEN, ultra fast processor, more capabilities than I ever imagined (still finding more and more cool features as I continue to use it further), outstanding battery life, incredible HD audio clarity on the phone (bizarre how clear actually), phenomenal camera and video with all kinds of different possible settings, and on and on and on. Rated for being immersed in water up to five feet for thirty minutes??? Military grade drop tested with a Gorilla glass screen?Can you tell how tickled I am with this phone? And to think I was just sold on the fact that you could pop in a spare fresh battery in ten seconds flat - this is an AMAZING SUPER PHONE PEOPLE !!!  I occasionally get something that under promises and over delivers - rare, but it happens. This is most definitely one of the best purchases I have made in years - SERIOUSLY  :)  :)  :)","April 9, 2021"
"Samsung Galaxy XCover Pro | Rugged (IP68 Rated) Unlocked (Verizon and AT&T) | Dual Sim | 64GB of Storage | SM-G715UZKDXAA, Black",T. L. Fulton,1.0,"I am an android phone user and have been using Samsung galaxy phones for the past decade. I started off with the Galaxy S3 moving to Galaxy S6, the Galaxy S8 Active ( my favorite so far) to the Galaxy Xcover Pro. I had to replace my S8 Active with a Xcover pro, because the S8 phone would not charge anymore in any way, and the Xcover pro was the closest match, even though it doesn't come close to the Galaxy S8 Active. Don't even know why Samsung has discontinued it.I purchased my Galaxy pro around a month ago on Amazon, which provided a 30 day return policy, however around 3 weeks ago, I started experiencing problems with my phone screen, the phone started restarting on its own, and I started seeing some white lines on my screen. Did not give it too much attention as I was very busy at work, and did not have any time to attend this issue.A couple days ago, the screen colors started fading, and the screen started acting up even more, tried calling samsung customer service yesterday but the hold times were over 2 hours, ended up giving up. This morning, I woke up to find the screen almost 90% faded, and the touch keys were not working, I was unable to use the phone at this point.I decided to take the phone to the nearest samsung electronics service center in Maywood NJ. The manager over there was very friendly, accepted to service the phone even though I had no appointment. Once I showed her the model, she told me that she wasnt sure if this model was serviced at this location, but still showed it to the Tech which then confirmed that there are no spare part available for this phone. I was then given the option to ship the phone to samsung and get it fixed under warranty, which would leave me without a phone for 7 business days!!! and that was my only option since I have no other phone to use ( Galaxy S8 wont charge). I refused and was then advised to call 1-800-SAMSUNGThis is when it gets even better, the service rep who picked up the phone was making it look like I was making this story up, and was trying to convince me that there was never a screen issue with this phone, and that this is the first time he hears this, I then asked to speak with a supervisor, which told me the same thing and was then transferred to case management. After two hours on the phone and 1 hour driving to get in and back from the service center, case management advised me to call ""U break it we fix it"" which is the Authorised repair facility for Samsung as mentioned by case management. I call their location in Westwood, and guess what?? They do not have any spare parts and I was then referred to the Service Center in Maywood that handles uncommon phones like mine. SO guess what, 3 hours later back to square one, I took a day off to resolve this issue.Bottom line is Samsung customer service is the worst!!! Will be duping this piece of trash in the garbage, and will purchase another phone with any other manufacturer that has an android platform.Thank you SAMSUNG","September 23, 2020"
"Samsung Galaxy XCover Pro | Rugged (IP68 Rated) Unlocked (Verizon and AT&T) | Dual Sim | 64GB of Storage | SM-G715UZKDXAA, Black",Paul C.,4.0,"Update 7/30: I've had this phone for over a month now. Here's a few things to either reinforce or introduce.Looking at the camera feed in the Ultra Wide mode while in motion/walking around to get shots makes me feel uneasy. Not sick, but it looks so off.It is IP68 rated. Still be cautious though.Get a case and screen protector. As someone who went from a thick rugged phone to this lighter weight but rugged phone, you want extra protection. I still use and abuse the other rugged phone, but I have found out very quickly that it wasn't as waterproof as the company claimed it be. (Don't get the Ulefone Armor 7, water will get in through the SIM card port even though it has a rubber gasket on it.)Still very strong on the gaming aspect having weird results from game to game. Even with the device up to date on updates, it still plays weird with some or runs smoothly on others. Your mileage will vary.Speakers... Still meh and disappointed about. Invest in wired earbuds (YES, it has a 3.5mm jack) or bluetooth ones.Bluetooth connects flawlessly, for me. No issues with connecting to numerous bluetooth earbuds, speakers, and car audio systems I've tested/daily use.Original:It's been since the Samsung Galaxy S5 that I've had a phone with a removable back and battery. Wow!Although it's IP68 rated, I'd still get a case and screen protector for this phone. As you should for most phones.I am very nit picky with phones. Over the past 3 years, I have gone through (either daily driven, tested and returned, or daily driven and broken) 7 Android phones and 1 Apple device (yuck BTW). I can say that I'm glad to be back with Samsung Galaxy line up, but there could be better options out there for the features I care about - especially the IP68 or IP69K dust and water resistant ratings.For what it's worth and in my tests/everyday use, this isn't a beefy rugged phone. However, it is an average joe type of rugged phone. (I define ""average joe"" as someone who daily drives this phone, keeps it turned on for months at a time unless they *somehow* install updates in that ""once in a solar eclipse"" moments, plays casual games or even as far as Pokemon Go, charges their phone without a care in the world, and rarely drops their phone but still want that sense of security it's not going to shatter on them if they drop it)Pros:+IP68 Rating. I love me a water resistant phone that I can take to the pool with me or get a bit wet in the rain.+Removable battery. I miss it. I still love it. If it happens to get a bit wet, do a unsafe shutdown by removing the battery. Put the phone in some moisture absorbing material or apparatus and check on it in 12-24hrs. (Not rice because the broken rice grains can get into spots it shouldn't)+Dual SIM and still have the microSD card? Yes please! Look... most phones have the dual SIM trays with one of the SIMs being a microSD card/SIM slot. Once you put a microSD card in, you only have 1 SIM slot. I hated that. But with this, you can have both SIM slots taken and still have the ability to put in a microSD card! (Nano SIMs are accepted on both SIM slots)+Speaking of Dual SIMs... Verizon and AT&T only, but it's great. I hate T-Mobile anyways. Verizon, minus their customer service and online registration, has been great. So when a phone has full Verizon capability, I'm in.+Cameras are decent. I like it, but I've had better phone cameras. Main cameras (25MP main, f/1.7, 26mm (wide), PDAF and 8MP wide, f/2.2, 123˚ (ultrawide), 1/4.0"", 1.12µm) are ok. I wouldn't use the 8MP wide for anything other than Panoramic photos. Selfie camera (13MP, f/2.0, (wide), 1/3.1"", 1.12µm) is good. I still look ugly, so there's that.Cons:-Playing games can be challenging. Some games like Shop Titans lag while Pokemon Go can run smoothly. Not sure why. Could be the ARM Mali-G72 MP3 GPU - which is integrated into the Exynos 9611 CPU. I've seen mixed reviews on the Exynos 9611 CPU. So your mileage can vary.-Single loudspeaker that isn't loud enough. I find myself having to put the phone closer to my ear, if I were to put my phone on speaker while I talk to someone. For music, it sounds more mono than a single speaker stereo output. Very disappointing.-Android 11... I am ok with it, but I hate it at the same time. It's got dark mode, which is nice. But Secure Folder isn't the best idea for locking apps. Android 9 had it better where you can lock apps with a code or password without having to sign into your profiles again. But it is easier to access your apps via the app drawer, unlike Android 10.-1 too many buttons for the same functions. There are 2 function keys, along with your fingerprint/lock button and 2 volume control buttons. The top key, which in default turned on your flashlight with 1 press. And the left side key, which turned on Bixby by default. I've gotten used to a phone where their function key was customizable for screenshots, without having to press the traditional Volume Down + Lock Button. So, it's disappointing that such function isn't accessible on the function keys. You can change the function keys to other actions like turning on and off a Flashlight, or launching your Settings, or anything app based. So you're not stuck with the defaults of Bixby and flashlight only.-Speaking of Bixby... I'm not a fan. I'm not a fan of Google Assistant either. But I would rather use Google and Bixby. I'm not sure if they'll upgrade to Samsung Sam at this point.","June 22, 2021"
"Samsung Galaxy XCover Pro | Rugged (IP68 Rated) Unlocked (Verizon and AT&T) | Dual Sim | 64GB of Storage | SM-G715UZKDXAA, Black",T Kebbe,5.0,"I love my LG G5 so much I bought more than 15 of it for my family and relatives, and 1 as a back up for myself, but unfortunately both died... one wouldn't turn on again one day and the other takes too much effort to repair. I have been eyeing this phone from Samsung since May 2020, but the only reason why I did not get it sooner was because the spare battery was nowhere to be found in the states. WTH Samsung? I was ready to upgrade the whole family to this phone, but you've let us down - you've let a lot of folks down.So why then the 5 stars? Read on....Going from the LG G5 to this phone was smooth. Only a few things that bothered me. So lets go over the cons first:- No spare battery available in th US. Enough said.- Volume is lower than any other phone I've used. I've disabled the volume limiter, but the volume on max settings for this phone including for its loudspeaker is still too low. For a phone marketed for industrial use, the audio quality should atleast be up to par with other phones. Microphone is clear and crisp, but what good is it if you can't really hear the other person on the line while being in an industrial environment? Regular users should be okay with the volume.- The fingerprint reader/power button is on the right near the volume buttons and is flushed with the side making hard to feel for  whereas the G5 has it slightly raised and it is the only button on the back...so it was easier to feel for. Would really rather have the ""XCover"" button as the power/fingerprint button.- Default button and screen page layout for this phone is messy and frustrating to navigate. It will require some fiddling to get a better end result. Can be much easier to use than the G5. My suggestion...download a button remapper app. It will make your life much easier. Let's just hope Samsung doesn't decide to disable the 3rd party button remapper as their button remapper is extremely limited, junk.- No IR blaster. Who uses it these days? I do, and quite often. Really miss this option...but then again...it's just me.Pros:- Long battery life. I use my phone heavily... to give you an idea...I go through at least 3 to 4 G5 batteries a day. With this phone from morning until night ...I still have about 20% left to go. This is the reason why I am not knocking off a star for the spare battery issue - there's  really no need to change battery. However, like all batteries, their charge cycles diminishes, and also because there will be time when I am out for days without a charger. Therefore, I still would like to see Samsung live up to its promises.- Feels good on the hand. Feels solid... not slipper...no fingerprints all over the phone. Looks clean - all the time.- Top button by default is a flashlight on/off. You can change the settings to even have it accessible even when the phone is locked. This is definitely one of my favorite feature for this phone. Ofcourse you can also remap it to other things too if you so choose. Same with the left ""Xcover"" button.- Removable battery and is waterproof? As long as you dont drop it deep into a lake...I was already sold on the removable battery.- Better cameras. The cameras setup is similar to what you get with the G5: Main camera, wide camera, and selfie...just better quality.- Charges quickly. For a battery this size...it completes its charge almost at the same time as the LG G5.Other things to consider:- May be on the heavier side. I don't mind this at all, but it is heavier than the G5. Just something you might want to note.Conclusion: it is an upgrade from the LG G5. And for the price, it definitely deserves a 4.5 five star rating. However, I can't give half a star, so I'll give it a 5 star and hope that Samsung will finally make available the spare battery plus charging cradle.","December 15, 2020"
"Samsung Galaxy XCover Pro | Rugged (IP68 Rated) Unlocked (Verizon and AT&T) | Dual Sim | 64GB of Storage | SM-G715UZKDXAA, Black",MRandomInterviews,2.0,"It took two phones ( the first shipped with no battery, shame on Samsung ) but once I had it and got it working, it's fine. Nice large and clear screen, quick fingerprint scanner and face recognition, battery lasts reasonably well. I really don't need a ""superthin"" expensive super phone and this works well and has features I like, like ruggedized, removable battery and dual sim ( once Samsung gets the software done to activate that ). This is NOT 5G capable but those networks are still coming in, will take awhile, and the 4G LTE works fine anyway.Good luck finding a spare battery. Nothing on Amazon or that other large Internet vendor. Good luck finding a dedicated charger for the battery outside of the phone. There are some ""universal"" chargers on Amazon and elsewhere but I returned the one I ordered, wouldn't work even following maker's specific instructions for XCover Pro battery. Cheaply made junk IMHO.So where is Samsung? Hey, I want to spend more money with you! Gone missing. This phone has been selling retail since early this year. But, nothing on their web site(s) for extra battery or dedicated charger. I called their service line, 1-800-SAMSUNG this morning ( Saturday ). That rep referred me to ""sales"". That was a crummy phone connection to an ESL person obviously overseas. After she did much looking and off line research, that rep said I need to talk to ""parts"" which isn't open weekends ( ! ). She said she will send me an e-mail number with the ""parts"" contact information for next week. I hope so but so far since the call, no e-mail yet.It's no bueno that I can't use one of the best features of this phone, swapable battery. Even more so that Samsung has such weak support for their otherwise nice product.","August 1, 2020"
"Samsung Galaxy XCover Pro | Rugged (IP68 Rated) Unlocked (Verizon and AT&T) | Dual Sim | 64GB of Storage | SM-G715UZKDXAA, Black",Weirdest,3.0,"I bought this phone for many of the reasons B. Rodgers cited in his thorough review. The phone is bigger and much heavier than what I expected [ UPDATE: but I got used to the bigger size and weight].Flagship phones are designed for obsolescence and cost twice as much. They have sealed-in batteries that typically fail after 2 years, and usually only promise 1-2 years of security updates. Since the Xcover Pro has Android 10 from the factory, it reportedly can support more thorough or lasting updates than Android 9 phones. The Xcover Pro guarantees 3-4 years of security updates, and has a 24-month warranty, whereas most phones offer only 12 month warranties and maybe 1 OS update.The battery can be swapped out before a new work shift, and swapped out at the end of its useful life, using only our bare hands. This phone is rugged, water resistant, and has good cameras; other phones with removable batteries have no water-resistance, low-end processors, and low-end cameras. I don't want to contribute to electronic waste, so I chose a phone that is designed to last. The ultra-wide-angle camera seems to cover about 135 degrees, so you can stand in a room corner and fit the whole room into the frame.It has a left-side button that can be assigned to any two apps via a long press or short press, and a top button that can be assigned to launch any two apps. The right-side power button can also be assigned, and I don't have to lift the phone off the desk to use the fingerprint reader that is built into the right-side power button.* Dictation without the cloudThis phone can convert speech to text internally, without sending your voice to the cloud. I confirmed this by dictating text into apps while holding the right-side button, even when I had the phone in airplane mode.* Wi-Fi callingI need Wi-Fi calling so I can place and receive calls without paying exorbitant roaming fees when I travel, while using my regular phone number. Although Samsung reassured me that all their phones including this one support WI-Fi calling, after purchase Samsung support told me that Wi-Fi calling requires cell-carrier bloatware baked into the phone's firmware. Consequently, if you want this phone to have Wi-Fi calling, the only option is to get a carrier version. In the US it is only Verizon, so you will have to put up with the worst customer service I have experienced in years, or purchase the phone from Verizon then use it on another network.* Point Of Sale (POS) transactions:Samsung claims that this is the only phone with EMV Level-1 compatibility: ""You can now accept payments without the need for additional hardware. The Galaxy XCover Pro has EMV Level-1 that makes it mPOS-ready."" However, the Xcover Pro does NOT have MST (Magnetic Secure Transfer) hardware, and therefore does not support Samsung Pay for paying at point of sale (POS) locations.Samsung claims I can use Google Pay, but I have not tried that, as I do not want Google to log every transaction I make with my phone. Unlike other payment systems, Samsung Pay uses MST hardware on their most popular phones to make credit card transactions compatible with all POS magnetic strip readers.The phone does have NFC payment, which works only on POS systems that support NFC. So Ironically, the XCover Pro has more capabilities for accepting payments from other credit cards, but fewer capabilities for making payments with your own credit card due to lack of MST hardware.This unlocked Xcover Pro has powered down for no apparent reason, and self-reset numerous times. I don't know if that's due to any of my installed apps, though they were working fine on my older & slower Samsung phone. I'm returning this phone and trying my luck with the Verizon version because Wi-Fi calling is essential to me. The Verizon XCover Pro is not self-resetting, but I have not yet allowed it to install the latest OS update, so I don't know if that will cause the resets.*** UPDATE on 2020-07-25: ***I purchased the $500 Verizon XCover Pro with a $200 discount to be credited monthly over 24 months, and an additional $200 credit on my first Verizon bill for porting my phone number to a Verizon Enterprise account. Obtaining a new account from Verizon was so aggravating I'm not sure it will be worth the savings.1) As far as I know my Verizon XCover Pro has not self-reset. I've had it for almost two months. I suppose I should restart the phone.2) If anyone has conclusively been able to get this unlocked XCover Pro to work with Wi-Fi calling, please reply to this review and let us know. Samsung told me Wi-Fi calling is not possible on an unlocked phone.3) If you have been able to get this phone at a discount from Verizon on a personal account, let us know.4)  Unsurprisingly, Verizon's custom bloatware on the Verizon version of the XCover Pro disabled the built-in FM radio. Carriers do this to push us into their data plan. So no emergency radio reception for when the towers are down or out of reach, and no radio feed without a data plan on the Verizon version.5) The FM radio on this unlocked phone was not disabled. However, I could not get FM radio reception using  the NextRadio app (all I heard was noise) even though reception was great on my nearby Android tablet using the same wired earphones as an antenna. Does the FM radio work on your XCover Pro? You you can install the NextRadio app and use wired earphones as an antenna.","June 7, 2020"
"Samsung Galaxy XCover Pro | Rugged (IP68 Rated) Unlocked (Verizon and AT&T) | Dual Sim | 64GB of Storage | SM-G715UZKDXAA, Black",Saulster,5.0,"I went from a S5 to a LG v20 to this phone. I've had it for about a day and this is the next generation phone for replacement battery users. This is a phone for everyone. I strongly believe it will become a best seller despite what the designers of the modern thin and flimsy phones want you to buy. Assuming I don't bust this phone it should last me 4+ years.This thing feels good in the hand. It's plastic/rubber material is welcome. I don't feel like it will slip out of my hand. I don't need a case! In the end this phone is smaller than my LG v20 with the smallest of cases on it.The software is okay. I'm not in love with what Samsung does but I've been able to make it more usable with some items in the play store (such as a brightness slider on the slide down menu). I turned off most of Samsung's stuff so it feels pretty simple. Not a lot of added apps. Some things you would expect aren't here but easily added (calculator, calendar and I'm sure some other basics I'm missing still).The screen is great. I was worried about sunlight with sun glasses on but it does just fine. However if you put the phone into landscape mode and are wearing polarized sun glasses - the screen is basically unusable.  Something due to the alignment of the pixels. So if you like to watch movies or play games with your sun glasses on don't get this phone. For me personally this is not a deal breaker one bit.When writing this on 6/9/2020 this phone doesn't quite feel finished. It's been a long time since I felt like an early adopter. The second SIM card isn't enabled yet. There is no way to purchase a second battery (however Samsung did above in the questions the product SKUs and a timeline when they will come out) and I find that odd as the first thing I want is a second battery and charger for it. TAKE MY MONEY. The walkie talkie feature sounds amazing but does not look supported yet and even when it is supported I'm not sure if I want to use MS teams. I wish it came with a minimal app to talk to other xcover pro's. I'd buy one for my wife instantly. With all of that said I've had no crashes or issues with getting anything to work.The camera is good and seems to be an upgrade from even my wife's S9+. I have not played around with the video a whole lot but it does seem to be fine, even if the app is too minimal for me. I really enjoy much higher FPS for certain types of recording and I will need to find another app for it.The physical side and top buttons are welcome as well as the headphone jack. It only comes with 1 speaker but it is loud and I'm fine with that. The phone works great with Samsung earbuds as you'd expect (then again...never know). Having external storage is fantastic also. I can keep hours of videos on this thing, which is something I find quite useful in my job.If you have a LG v20 or a S5 just get this phone. The price is right and we should be supporting a phone made for people who live in the real world. If you just busted your back glass or screen or have a big stupid looking case on your phone then get this one. It might last you years and years. Even when you upgrade from this in 2024 you can always slap a new battery and use it as a backup phone.","June 9, 2020"
"Samsung Galaxy XCover Pro | Rugged (IP68 Rated) Unlocked (Verizon and AT&T) | Dual Sim | 64GB of Storage | SM-G715UZKDXAA, Black",BuyBye planet Earth,4.0,"Overall, a very solid phone. I was trying to decide between this and the ($200 more expensive) Cat S62 Pro, so I'll discuss pros and cons compared between the two. Spoiler alert: I finally decided on the CAT S62 Pro.Pros:-- Screen -- The screen on this phone is nice and responsive. It's the nicer of the two, overall. Crisp display, nice colors for the price point, clear letters.-- Battery -- I only used it off and on for a little bit, but the battery life was nice. The battery is actually replacable. That's one of the few phones on the market that does that. I really wanted to like this phone for that very reason.-- Protection -- Overall, the case design was very nice (it's supposed to be a rugged phone after all). I didn't test waterproofness since I wasn't sure if I wanted to keep the phone. The camera was recessed beneath the case cover, the edges around the screen were bossed to provide extra protection. That was actually better than the S62 whose camera wasn't recessed, but was in fact excessed.Personal Preferences:-- UI -- With that being said, the UI on this is a Samsung UI and it's not one that I'm as fond of as the S62 UI due to having come from an S41. It's a personal preference, so no knock against the phone. Basically, the back button and the window carousel button are swapped.-- OS and Preloads -- Oh, the S62 is a stripped down Android with two or three of its own apps. The Samsung has quite a few extra apps. Most of them are quite nice, but I don't need any of them, so they're bloatware to me: Bixby, Samsung App Store, and some other baked in features (e.g. the UI is built by Samsung, not a stock Google one, and Samsung has its accounts baked into the setting pages. The preloads may be a con to you, but it wasn't for me. It runs Android 10, which doesn't have all the new permissions junk that 11 has.-- Call Quality -- In my particular setup, call quality was decent, but not stellar. The S62 beat out the Samsung slightly. It could have been the party I was calling, or a host of other issues, so I didn't factor this into my overall rating.-- Settings -- The settings page wasn't intuitive for me (since it's Samsung's arrangement of the settings page), but I'm also used to a different setup.Cons:-- Camera -- The camera on this has a higher megapixel count, but the S62 actually had better shots with its 12MP camera. So this camera has larger photos with a slightly lower quality.-- Phone Back -- To access the battery, SIM card, and SD card, a cover on the back of the phone must be popped off. This is just a plastic panel, so I'm worried about the durability of the panel over time.Ultimately, I returned the XCover Pro in favor of the CAT S62 Pro, but it was close. The S62 has slightly better IP ratings, and a slightly better camera, oh and the FLIR sensor. In all fairness, as mentioned earlier, the S62 is nearly $200 more, though (which is roughly the cost of the FLIR sensor in it).","March 21, 2022"
"Samsung Galaxy XCover Pro | Rugged (IP68 Rated) Unlocked (Verizon and AT&T) | Dual Sim | 64GB of Storage | SM-G715UZKDXAA, Black",RJW,4.0,"I bought this thinking it would be a nice upgrade as I'm a current verizon customer and none of their current offerings have a replaceable battery. This phone is advertised as compatible with verizon network but after 2 new sim cards, and 2 weeks with customer support of both Samsung and verizon, a supervisor from verizons customer support came back and said it's not compatible. So buyer beware, what is compatible is data streaming services. What is not compatible is calling and texting, as the only way to do that is through data streaming. So if you're setup with a phone number through volp and you're not planning to use 4g for calling or txting this is the phone for you.For details of my ordeal:I bought this without a sim card and went to a small wireless shop near me to get a new sim card. First person said, I can't register this sim card with your device, you'll need to contact customer support and have them mail you a new sim card. After calling customer support, they said you have to go to a verizon company store. Went to a verizon company store who did the check on the imei#, installed new sim card but when she tried to make a test phone call, it wouldn't connect. She goes, this phone isn't compatible, sorry, call the manufacturer. I left which was a big mistake because I should've rolled my service back to old phone since everything now authenticates through txt, including email and bank accounts. I wasn't connected to world and an Aunt reported me missing to police. Got resolved, but still stressed her out. Called Samsung and they said, it should work on verizon there's no additional settings needed, it's a network issue, call verizons customer support. So I did and customer support told me when they try to activate it it'll appear for a split second on their screen but doesn't connect. So she rolled back my service to old phone so I'm connected to world again and sent me a new sim card. Plan was to activate new sim card on old phone, and place in new phone. I get new sim card but old phone was too old and no longer compatible. So I called Verizon customer support again and went through 2 reps and a supervisor who finally told me this phone isn't compatible with verizons network.The phone itself is fast and responsive. Great look and still has a replaceable battery. But don't get this if you use cellular networks for calling and texting. Every single rep I talked too, both verizon and Samsung asked to verify compatibility with imei# and it always checked out. If this was to teach people to buy their phones directly from a carrier, f them.","November 10, 2021"
"Samsung Galaxy XCover Pro | Rugged (IP68 Rated) Unlocked (Verizon and AT&T) | Dual Sim | 64GB of Storage | SM-G715UZKDXAA, Black",T. L. Fulton,4.0,"So got this phone as my old one of 6 yrs finally crapped out after going through a dozen replaceable batteries and after I could no longer delete enough carrier bloatware to stop the phone from bogging down - did I mention it was old? So because of my job I needed a phone that can be used for 18 to 24 hrs without a charge and that means a replaceable battery - also nice to have extra storage in the form of an SD card as it allows one to avoid prematurely clogging up the device memory with all those 2 thousand songs and photos.That pretty much limited my choices, buy an older phone model like the LG V20 which is old already, or buy a really old old model like the galaxy S5 like I just had - or buy the Samsung Galaxy xcover pro. So I got the xcover and got two extra batteries from England for 60 bucks delivered - they arrived in 3 days same day as the phone, (noice job there mates). Anyway getting the phone to work on Verizon (the only carrier that works reliably at my home) was an adventure. Couldn't swap the Sim card as the xcover takes a smaller one than the one in my old phone. Drove 30 miles to town to get a new Sim card - first place all out - drove 5 more miles to next place they had one. They put it in the phone activated it and started transfering data. Longer story short the new Sim was bad couldn't make or receive calls and once that was resolved still couldn't make calls until they found that the hd digital box had to be checked and activated on my Verizon account. After that it finally worked. So yeah, can't give it four stars as the phone came with no documentation - there is a manual online but you have to look for it - and it was real pain to get it to work - I certainly could not have done it on my own and was weirdly lucky to run into a computer/phone geek at the verizon store who took an hour to make it work, ""cause it should work.""Using the phone is fine - a little bigger than I'm used to but seems like most of the phones are all huge now-a-days. Love the replaceable batteries a real life and anxiety saver. Like the fast charge. Phone seems to work fast enough. Love the SD card just drop all the crap right on it. Can't speak to durability - like the claimed drop resistance, water resistance, etc.... But still got a case and a screen cover as crap happens. Overall I am very glad to have found this phone, it's what I needed.","November 16, 2020"
"Samsung Galaxy XCover Pro | Rugged (IP68 Rated) Unlocked (Verizon and AT&T) | Dual Sim | 64GB of Storage | SM-G715UZKDXAA, Black",T Kebbe,4.0,"I love the phone. It is so much nicer than my older Note 4.  It has Facial Recognition, as well as a Fingerprint Reader. This Fingerprint reader is now part of the on/off button on the side of the phone. You only need to position your index finger on it as you hold the phone in your hand... no more swiping your finger!  In addition to the up and down volume toggle buttons on the right edge of the phone, there is a power button which is also the finger print reader. There are two additional buttons, one of the left edge and one on the top edge, both of which can be assigned to an app or a event.  The LED light used for notification has been moved from the top front of the phone to the top edge of the phone, so you can't always see the LED flashing unless you're looking at the top edge of the phone.The phone is thin and actually longer than my Note 4. In addition, the screen is larger and resolution is higher especially since the the display is the entire front, as there is no loner a bezel. Even the front facing camera is inside the screen display, which is strange when looking at a picture since you may think that there is a black dot in the top right of the picture, when actually it is the front facing camera.Since the phone is not sold by Verizon, I had some issues getting it provisioned.  Some of the Verizon employees said it wasn't supported, when in fact it is. The phone has two SIM card slots. When I entered the 1st IMEI number (slot 1) on the Verizon site, it said that this phone is a perfect match. I eventually got it provisioned by swapping the SIM card between my Note 4 and XCover Pro phones.  The only remaining issue is that voice mail doesn't work when the SIM in in the XCover Pro.  I have to believe that that will eventually get fixed. (I am on hold with Verizon as I type this).The documentation is almost useless. A simple pamphlet is provided with a basic diagram, but it is not clearly evident that slot 1 actually has a lower slot for a Verizon nano SIM card, and an upper slot, for the SD card.  There is of course a second SIM card slot to the right of first for a GSM SIM card. You need to remove the large battery to access any of the slots (which is simple).  Also the first SIM card slot has a very tiny embedded lever that allows you to easily remove the nano SIM card! I didn't look to see if the second SIM card slot has a similar lever.","July 18, 2020"
"Samsung Galaxy XCover Pro | Rugged (IP68 Rated) Unlocked (Verizon and AT&T) | Dual Sim | 64GB of Storage | SM-G715UZKDXAA, Black",Mack,4.0,"Very nice phone with a few caveats. First I am a consumer user not a business enterprise.The phone is fast, very nice screen, quality build with Android 10, no carrier bloatware. The big thing for me is the replaceable battery. Every new smartphone I have had to buy is because the built battery would not hold a charge and was a pain to replace. (I know I have done it myself).Now for some issues with setup.  There is no user manual available.  I went to the Samsung site and not there.  Therefore you have to stumble through by yourself.Inserting the SIM and SD Card.  The phone has SIM 1 and SIM 2.  for Verizon use SIM 1.  The SIM card is installed under the SD Card.  The slots are under the battery.  Turning the phone on is intuitive, push the button on the side.  Turning the phone off is not intuitive, the button does not work.  The off button is on the upper right corner next to the settings button, both visible after swiping down.  Transferring data and apps from your old phone is a snap, follow the prompts.Since this a Global phone when you turn it on it automatically selects the best carrier, GMS or CDMA.  What this means when you turn it on the first time it will connect but maybe not to Verizon.  Here is what you have to do.Go to:SettingsConnectionsMobile NetworkNetwork ModeManualNetwork OperatorsChoose VerizonNow you are all set and on the Verizon network. If you try to activate on line with the EMIE it tells you it is invalid however the phone is on the network and works fine.  I called Verizon and the only reason this happens is that the global phone is not yet in their EMIE database yet it will work fine (Verizon sells the same phone with a slightly different sub-model number).  The only thing you will notice is that on line under ""My Devices""  you will see your phone number but no picture or model of your phone.Some have questioned say that the phone does not support WIFI calling, it does in fact support WIFI calling, to activate you have to enter emergency contact information.  I know this correct because I have it set up for WI-FI calling.  Just ordered an OTTERBOX from their website, 20% less than on Amazon with free shipping.Hope this helpful, great phone","June 9, 2020"
"Samsung Galaxy XCover Pro | Rugged (IP68 Rated) Unlocked (Verizon and AT&T) | Dual Sim | 64GB of Storage | SM-G715UZKDXAA, Black",AutoKlick,5.0,"TL;DR: If you want an S-Pen, iPhone, or a phone to play PUBG on this is not your phone. Everyone else should seriously consider it.If anyone asks you what phone they should buy, this should be #1 on the list. It's not for everyone - but it is for everyone that doesn't know enough about phones to know why they need the latest Galaxy S, Note, Asus ROG, or other specialty or flagship phones.This phone is rugged, yes. but it looks almost identical to most every black rectangle out there. Nobody is going to look at this phone and think it's for construction workers. It's got a little extra on the corners, and a slight lip around the screen to keep the screen safer. It doesn't affect usability in any way.Why else should this phone be at the top of lists? There's so many good reasons:* Durability. Yeah, no phone is invincible, but being able to survive getting knocked off a table onto a tile floor is great (and the reason I had to replace my wife's phone).* Headphone jack. Yep, their loss isn't mourned or protested anymore, but it's nice to have.* Waterproof. Every phone should be.* User replaceable battery. This phone proves that there is no valid argument about phone thickness, bulkiness, or loss of waterproofing by offering this. It takes 5 seconds to swap a battery.* Expandable memory slot. Still on most phones, but this phone does it without giving up a second SIM card slot.* Dual sim. A lot of phones give up the memory card slot to have this feature. Not this phone. Put two lines in it, and a memory card.* USB-C. It doesn't have the blazing fast charging rates that the Note 10 has, but it's still fast.* Fingerprint reader in the power button. In-screen readers are still terrible (nearly unusable at times in my Note 10), this one is fast and accurate.* Modern Processor. The Exynos 9611 isn't their flagship processor, but it's a huge step up from what is put in most of the rugged phones out there. It's about equivalent to a 2018 flagship chip (Snapdragon 665) in terms of speed. Plenty fast for anything that isn't ""hardcore"" phone gaming.* IPS screen. Not a flagship OLED screen, but it looks fantastic, and better than standard LCD.* Gorilla Glass 5. Scratch resistant and tough.* Notification LED. I miss this on newer phones, but it has an LED so you can see if there's active notifications.* Regular and wide angle lenses.* Half the price of a Galaxy S20.Nitpicks (or the only stuff I miss from a flagship device).Tap to wake is not enabled by default.The holepunch camera hole is bigger than flagship phones.Single speaker instead of stereo.It might be larger than some people want.No Samsung Pay means you can't use it with old magnetic-only card readers.No 5G.

All of the features of this device are exactly as described and as advertised. Two of my biggest complaint are first, it takes the phone almost 2 minutes to fully power up. I'm not certain why. I've researched on Samsung, watched Youtube vids, read online articles, read community forum reviews. Unfortunately, I have not found any helpful tips to resolve this issue. Second, BEWARE! There are a lot of system updates right after you get the phone setup on your carrier's network. You can delay the updates but at some point, you're going to want to just do them for the security and functionality of the device. My advice is to ensure you are connected a very good private wifi connection. I do not recommend doing the system updates over your carrier mobile network. It will take way too long. Watching videos and reading through the user guide is very helpful to learn about all the features of this otherwise amazing phone. Hope this review is helpful.

I got this to replace a Samsung Galaxy S6 Active.  That six year old phone was the most trouble-free phone I've ever owned going all the way back to the mid-1990s.  I've been hard on it, but it still looks like a brand new phone.  I was reluctant to give it up, but the battery was giving out, the phone was spending a lot of time tethered to the charger, and the case is sealed so it's not easy to change the battery.  I decided to go with a new phone instead.The Xcover PRO is actually a lot larger and heavier than I was expecting, but I'm getting used to it.  I unboxed the phone, put the battery in it and charged it up.  It took about 90 minutes for a full charge.  Transferring my old apps and contacts to the new phone was painless and was over in mere minutes.  I plugged in the SIM card and made a few calls on it.  It works fine on AT&T.  Battery life appears to be excellent.  I still have more than 50% at the end of the day, so I could probably get through a second day at work without having to recharge.  The camera gets some great shots.  I love the combo side key/fingerprint reader.  It's the perfect place to put it... right on the unlock button.Nothing too mysterious about this phone.

"Samsung Galaxy XCover Pro | Rugged (IP68 Rated) Unlocked (Verizon and AT&T) | Dual Sim | 64GB of Storage | SM-G715UZKDXAA, Black",Verified Purchaser,4.0,"I've dropped this phone from over 1 story at a work site and all that happened was the force of the impact made the battery come out and it left a little scuff mark on the edge of the phone. Aside from that, everything in it still works fine. Also it's a pretty slim phone that you can easily carry around in your pockets. The camera is nice, I've used it for a few shots in a short film I'm putting together. The only complaints I have are: the touch sensitivity can be kinda lacking, sometimes I have the touch screen doesn't register in certain spots, so I have to press a few times or harder. Also it would be nice if I could figure out how to turn off the tint on the screen, idk if it's a permanent blue light filter, but it throws me off sometimes. Lastly, I really hate how samsung tries to encourage you to use it's Bixby feature, which gets in the way of other task that are more important, like turning off the phone.. now you have to press and hold two buttons at the same time (power and down volume) to prompt the phone to turn off, restart, or go in airplane mode. However if you accidentally press and hold just the power button, it activates Bixby, pretty annoying and invasive, imo. I would still recommend, or if you have more money, maybe look into the Cat phones, I think they're american made too!","January 4, 2022"

This is the best se.i-ruggedized phone they will now allow on the network. I had to replace my Doogee 96s pro as it isn't on ATTs approved list even though it technically supported VoLTE completely on the network.Problems I have with the Galaxy is that it really doesn't seem to be a ruggedized phone. It has little protection from drops and the removable back cover is super thin and flimsy. There are no covers for the ports. Even though they are internally sealed water can get in them and cause issues. The first thing I had to do was buy a good case and screen protector to make up for some of these shortcomings.  Then, the processor isn't the best and it shows some. No huge issues but some things aren't as instantaneous as I'm used to on better ruggedized phones. The ram is sorely lacking and so is internal memory.  For less money my Doigee had a better processor and twice the memory.  This is a huge mistake on Samsung's part in my opinion.The cameras are the minimum I would accept in a smart phone and really lacking compared to other higher end ruggedized phones.  The resolution of both is half of the Doogee and the doogee wide angle is way better. On top of that this phone offers NO dedicated camera like the FAIRS and IR night vision other higher end ruggedized phones add.The one positive is that this does out shine the Kyocera phones ATT offers as ruggedized phones.","February 22, 2022"

So I really don't like the operating system yet.  However the phone itself is wonderful!  Much cheaper then a new iphone, a great screen, love the size, the multiple buttons available for different uses.  I am VERY hard on phones and 2 things brought me to this, the first being its ruggedized.  Have already dropped it from about 4 feet onto a wooden floor a few times, absolutely no issues.  Got it covered in snow several times, big deal, wiped it off, stuck it in my pocket.  So far completely bombproof.  The extra batteries.  A removable battery!  What an amazing old fashioned idea!  Love it!  My iphone battery lasted about 2 years.  So I went out and bought 2 extra batteries for this phone and just rotate them through every few days.  Cost $25 each and had to order them from England but the lady was totally awesome and they arrived here in the US in 3 days.So, don't like the OS but I will get used to it.  OH and I DESPISE the keyboard for texting!  The  key sizes and spacing are all wrong for me and I constantly misspell but hopefully will get better.  But the phone itself is wonderful so far. I would very much recommend it.  I get a solid 36 hours out of a battery, its bombproof so far and I love the screen.  Buy some extra batteries and its a great package.","February 17, 2021"
"Samsung Galaxy XCover Pro | Rugged (IP68 Rated) Unlocked (Verizon and AT&T) | Dual Sim | 64GB of Storage | SM-G715UZKDXAA, Black",Doc Savage,1.0,"First off, this phone felt great in my hand, which only made the rest of my experience that much harder to accept. My whole family is on a T-Mobile plan. T-Mobile is also one of the most accessible providers in the US when it comes to BYOD (bring your own device) phones, and every ""unlocked"" phone I've ever had worked with their network, except this one. Data works fine over the 4G network but it's when you go to make a call that things get crappy. As soon as you dial out or the phone starts to ring for an incoming call, it switches over to 3G and you get all the quality of a 20 year old technology. T-Mobile was super helpful and bumped me to higher tier tech support immediately, but soon tracked the problem down to this model not being compliant with their VoLTE system, which is because Samsung didn't make the phone compatible with the T-Mobile network. No option of getting a network update exists from T-Mobile, because they're not the ones writing that code, Samsung is.Samsung's tech support was an embarrassing testimony to a behemoth in the cell phone world. Their business tech agent (this phone is part of their business line of devices) had almost no information in her system about this issue. In fact, the IMEI number showed up as being locked to Verizon while the phone's own  model number, software, and box all indicated it was an unlocked version. All the poor lady could do was recommend I go back to T-Mobile and ask them to make it work. T-Mobile also has a page where you can check to see if your device is compatible with BYOD, and entering the IMEI on that page immediately returns the message that the Xcover Pro is NOT compatible. All-in-all, the experience left me with a nasty taste for Samsung in my mouth. I sold my old phone the day before the new one arrived, but because of the incompatibility I ended up without a phone for three days, which in this day and age is horrible when you run a business and need to make and take calls, navigate to customers, and deal with emails on the run. The phone seemed great, but the experience was awful.The moral of the story is that Samsung is presenting this phone both here on Amazon as well as on their own website as an unlocked phone, which it is not - at least in the generally accepted meaning of that word. It may be unlocked from Verizon, but it's not compatible with a lot of other carriers. A customer shouldn't have to actually buy the phone to test it out or check it for compatibility (you need an IMEI number in most cases to do this). This information should be clearly presented by Samsung, and it's their failure that it's not. Shame on them!Edit to add: A lot of other reviews here mention problems with Wi-Fi calling, but I wonder whether some of the posters are confusing that with VoLTE which is like Wi-Fi calling but over the provider's data network. I personally did not have issues with Wi-Fi calling. It connected to my home network just fine and when connected, it used that connection for inbound and outbound calls (the LTE signal bars disappear when you're on a Wi-Fi network). It's the VoLTE part of the equation that's the issue with this phone on some carriers. It simply isn't capable of using many of the data networks for voice calls, which almost any other modern phone can do.","September 26, 2020"

Fulton,4.0,"I'm disappointed that only the international version has an FM tuner, and that this wasn't explained until I contacted Samsung tech support chat. On the other hand, it has a replaceable battery, microSD card slot, and headphone jack on a rugged Samsung phone in 2021. It is also made in veitnam instead of China. This is what sold me on it, the fm tuner would have just been a bonus. Finger print reader is just OK. Maybe it's just my fingers that get cut up at work, but the old AGM X2 had a larger sensor on the back of the phone that never complained that my finger wasn't all the way on the sensor. AGM X2 had a 6000mAh battery, and this XCover just doesn't hold a candle to it battery life wise with its 4000ish battery. But it's replaceable, so I plan on buying a spare or two.I also don't like the fad of putting the camera inside the screen, it's like a constant circle of dead pixels. The iPhone notch wasn't any better. Just give me my larger bezel back. Oh well, I'll probably get used to it eventually.

"Samsung Galaxy XCover Pro | Rugged (IP68 Rated) Unlocked (Verizon and AT&T) | Dual Sim | 64GB of Storage | SM-G715UZKDXAA, Black",N. D. Jones,5.0,"This is an excellent smart phone at a reasonable price. My previous device was a Samsung ""Active"", which had an area fingerprint reader on the back surface that was nearly useless as it required the orientation and placement of my finger to be nearly perfect. This reader is essentially a linear array, and so well integrated into the inset-side-mounted on/off button that it is reliable, hence routinely useful. I purchased the phone through Amazon (good), and followed the on-line guide to transfer files and set it up (again, good). Transfering my activated AT&T account was another matter. The technical information that came with the phone made a point that a certain (specified) SIM card was required. To my eyes, that description did not match the SIM card in my Active. Calls to AT&T did not work. A visit to the local AT&T store at first was unsuccessful. The clerk shook his head and walked away, passing off my request to another agent. She pointed out that the SIM in my older Active was the correct variety, and in a few minutes had switched them out, tested, and verified that all was well. She told me that Samsung has used the same SIM card on all of their phones for the past several years. Easy peasy for the cognizenti :~) Other features...The back plate of this phone removes easily (without tools), allowing access to the innards. The battery may be removed (for security if required), replaced, or swapped out to be charged externally (extra equipment needed). There is an internal slot for another chip to increase storage. The screen is hardened glass, so that no screen protector should be required.","April 22, 2021"

It started having screen issues after a software update or so it seems as there were no other changes that had been made to the phone. The screen would not come on bright enough to see what was on the phone.  I then contacted Samsung customer service to try to figure out a fix. After trying several different things including clearing cache and even a factory reset it was determined I needed to take it to a repair store.  Huh none exist that will mess with an X Cover Pro so it had to be sent to a Samsung facility in Texas. So after a week without my phone it was sent back and I was told there were no issues found.  Well that is wonderful because upon unboxing my phone and attempting to turn on low and behold, ""Same Issue"". The screen was impossibility dim and it took several minutes of messing with it to get it to come up. (And yes adaptive brightness is turned off) So I was informed by another Samsung tech rep to ""send it in again and have them look at it"" the rep then said if they cannot figure anything out they will send me another phone of the same model. Well thats fair right. Or so I thought because after determining that they were unsure of what was wrong with the phone and I was owed a replacement they told me it would be 15 days before one would be sent out...  Ok, my agitation is growing because after 2 days in shipping and another few days in the facility being looked at combined with the previous sending in I am now without the device for over a month.But we haven't made it to the best part yet... The replacement does the same crap. After about a month it has started doing the same thing. The only thing that changed was another software update and it very well might just be coincidence. Although now I am not so gentle with the phone. I have found that when the issue happens if you smack the phone against your palm it will come on. Sometimes it takes once or twice sometimes more but Samsung wants me to play UPS tag with them again.  Arrrrrg.So if I may I would suggest to stay away from the X Cover Pro and find something a bit more common as it is great in theory but failed in use.","March 23, 2021"

I was worried about it being too big, that some users had issues with WiFi calling and the fact it was new technology. So I’m not sure why people had trouble using WiFi calling I was able to turn it in simply under call settings on Verizon. I was worried about not having a home button, but the new technology is great, I don’t miss it. I was worried about upgrading to a type c charger from old school usb, it’s awesome. I love my phone so much, there are only a few things I don’t like. So there are few cases available and they aren’t cute, which I get it’s a rugged phone but I like my speck cases and none fit. It is also is missing the always on display. I know I could buy myself a watch, but I really miss my Always on Display. While I’m sure it’s not good for the battery life, I used it a lot and have had it for awhile..... that’s honestly my only issues.

Completely inadequate for a demanding business environment. This is not a power user's phone.

I tried this phone for 28 days and had to return it. I loved the ruggedness, the removable battery which I was unable to find in the US sadly, the potential for Pogo charging which I was unable to find in the US sadly..The phone I had before this was a note 8 which is definitely a flagship phone of its day, so someone coming from an older non flagship phone would probably be happy with this. It also made me sad that Samsung pay wasn't available at all.  Even for non MSG payment.Ultimately I ended up getting an s10e which is such an excellent phone and has a flat screen which was one of my biggest wants after spending so much on curved screen protectors of any kind of quality.Overall I would say pass it unless you expectations of multitasking and power using are set quite low.","August 1, 2020"

There's no pattern or reason for it. sometimes it's while I'm using it other times it's just randomly while it's sitting there. It would do this about 10 times a day. I registered the device with Samsung and contacted them about the issue. They sent me to a repair shop. They told me it was a software issue/app issue and advised me to do a factory reset and delete any apps I could. I did as they instructed and still had the same issue. I contacted Samsung again and they kept trying to send me back to the repair shop. I finally told them id like to use the warranty because I had the issue out of the box. They told me that all they can do is keep sending me to the repair shop because I didn't send it back within the first two weeks. The only reason i didn't send it back within the first two weeks was that they made me go to the repair shop.

No damage to the screen and the phone was not dropped. Had Samsung warranty repair product. After it was fixed I decided to no longer carry it while working and just left it in my vehicle so it would not break. Well that did not work. After 5 months the same issue reoccurred. I spoke with Samsung and asked if they would exchange my phone or refund me. They said there is a 28 day return policy and there are no exceptions. Very disappointed with the phone and Samsung company. I bought several Samsung products in the past, but I will never buy a Samsung product again after this.

This device is NOT on AT&T's VOLTE list, so they won't activate it without jumping through a bunch of hoops even if you buy one from them.  It doesn't have the bands to work on T-Mobile, so that's a no-go.  It does work on Verizon though! (except for the fact that voicemail never worked on one of them and they never could figure it out and a recent update nuked BOTH of these phones on my account, and Verizon's repeated message is that I needed new SIM cards that also never fixed anything through the 3 times changing them.)As for the device itself, there's no wireless charging which is no fun.  The cameras are better than most ""rugged"" phones, and overall the performance is pretty snappy.

The sims for both the donor phones worked well, but when placed into this Xcover pro, whichever sim was in the 2nd sim tray was not seen by the phone, nor was there a sim manager installed in the settings as is on dual sim phones. I believe the phone had incorrect firmware/software installed from the factory.  After a long, long, session with Samsung help, I was directed to take the phone to a Samsung authorized repair center. I explained the problem to them, and they said they would probably have to reflash the firmware.  When I returned to pick up the phone the repair tech said the phone  needed to have the correct firmware/software installed, but since it was an international phone, not a North American phone Samsung would not allow them to do that. In other words, Amazon sold me an international phone which did not work due to Samsung's not installing the correct firmware/software, and because it was not a North American phone, Samsung would not allow it to be repaired in North America. Thanks a lot Amazon and Samsung! No less than 10 hours of my time wasted on this brick! I'll be getting a RMA and returning it today.

Phone is roughly the same speed as my S7 on latest update. A definite sacrifice.2. Phone doesn't support wireless charging.3. No always on display; closest I could get is a clock screen saver while on charger.4. And the doozy: phone is supposed to be 'waterproof', only problem is the USB port insists that phone is wet even when it couldn't possibly be, like after charging to 100% over night and waking up to see the phone says it's wet.  Now once it says it's wet you're done because it won't charge and takes typically 8 hours to 'dry'.  If you're on a mission or just on the road with maps, you're screwed.  Flush cache, restart, fan, vacuum cleaner, rice... Doesn't matter.  Yes, the phone allows you to replace the battery but who wants to do minor surgery every three hours and carry an external charger just because of a bug.Apart from #3, which in my opinion makes the phone useless for mission critical 'activities' it works ok for someone, just not for anything I need a phone for.","August 11, 2020"

This included my favorite feature, which was an included pen!Pros: Everything about it has been a great improvement!+ Fantastic photos! Included in my review is a photo of my cat. The photo is so clear, you could practically count each and every strand of fur.+ Great battery: much better than my old phone, I could carry this phone all day and not need to charge it until I'm home. I use it decently to watch YouTube, and by the time I'm done with my 8 hour shift, I still have 60% when I head home.+ The S Pen was again my favorite feature from my last phone. They improved the battery life of it and also made more features with the pen! With motion swipes of the pen, you could zoom in and out of the camera and then take a photo. Along with that, also adjust music volume or just switch to the next song!Cons:- If you prefer to use the aux cord, Sadly they removed it from the phone. It sucks since not everything I own has adopted to bluetooth.- No SD card slot, which means if you want more storage, you can not upgrade or purchase an SD card. The only solution is to get a cloud storage or get the same phone but with more storage space.Overall, despite the few cons, I am happy with my purchase. I would be even happier if they didn't remove them, but I still enjoy it and I haven't encountered any problems after months of use.","November 8, 2022"

The FHD screen is nice and the extra brightness does make the screen seem a lot more alive. The 108 mp camera is excellent and the charge speeds with a 45 watt charger are convenient. I believe the s pen is on a capacitor so it drains battery from the phone--kind of lame. Game play and video playback have been great so far, no problems. Phone can get from hots-spotting and multi-tasking but stays cooler than the S21. My main gripe about this premium flagship would be the battery life, but the charging speed while quick is a mediocre attempt to make up for it. So far no issues. Phone has been great with Tmobile. I bought the phone to replace my S21 and for it's trade-in value once the S23 is released. Great phone overall. Still feels like I have something I don't need.","November 6, 2022"

I thought a bigger screen and 5 cameras would mean a better phone,,, well I was wrong!The S22 ultra is an amazing phone, I'll start with that. It's just not any different from the Note 20 which came out TWO years ago!! It feels and functions the same in a day to day basis.I also feel like 5 cameras are just too much to put on the back, it looks ugly and they don't make any difference for a casual photographer!Quick points of comparison if you were ever debating between both phones :Screen: both screens are amazing, obviously a bigger screen on the S22 ultra gives more room for watching or scrolling through your phone.Cameras : Honestly the pixel 6 pro seems to have a much better camera software. Photos seem to look better with the Pixel's camera without tweaking the shot while with Samsung you had to know exactly what to select to get a proper shot. The selfie l/front camera on Samsung still gives that washed out, not true, picture vs the Pixel's more natural look. Both are not great in low light situations, though night mode is a little better on the Pixel.Software: The pure Android experience on Pixel is unmatched! The phone is much cleaner and feels more efficient. With Samsung One UI skin, you get tons of useless things to do the same job! Everything is big and the side tray interferes with the Android 12 back gesture, you want to open a page there are 5 apps that can be used for it.It just feels cluttered and less appealing.Size: The pixel 6 pro, for me, feels like the perfect dimension, but thatay go down to each one's opinion. However the weight is just too much for the S22 ultra, it's also VERY slippery,that's basically unusable without a case.Going back to the pixel after many days with the S22 ultra just feels right and being more than $400 cheaper makes it a better deal as well.Battery: both have less than average batteries, which was a little disappointing, given that most of my other Samsung phones had pretty good battery life,, but not this one, you definitely can't have a full day of average use with full specs on this one unfortunately.Don't get me wrong, the S22 Ultra ia a very good phone, it's just not that much better than the 2 year old note 20,the curved screen feels a bit outdated, and it's much more annoying to use, and the camera software still isn't great.","March 5, 2022"

Luckily I already own galaxy buds 2 wireless earbuds, so even the lack of a headphones input doesn't bother me as much.The s pen is pretty cool. My kids love it. Battery life has been manageable.

The battery life is only slightly improved from my old S10, the phone is HEAVY compared to the S10, which of course expected given that it's much larger. But with the extra size all you really get is a larger screen far better cameras and slightly increased battery. I personally bought the S22 on sale and for the camera so I don't regret buying it however I do miss not having the SD card as I take alot of photos so having to constantly plug the phone in to upload photos to my PC sucks.

If this is such a sensitive screen, the producer must protect it agains damage from very beginning - and put screen protector as factory default feature. what is the reason to sell it without protection if there is such a high probability of damaging it...the turn on turn off button is not also functioning well. overall waste of money!","March 2, 2023"

The front-facing 10MP camera also delivers high-quality selfies and video calls.StorageWith 128GB of internal storage, the Galaxy S22 offers ample space for apps, photos, videos, and other media.

"Samsung Galaxy S22 Smartphone, Factory Unlocked Android Cell Phone, 128GB, 8K Camera & Video, Brightest Display, Long Battery Life, Fast 4nm Processor, US Version, Phantom Black (Renewed)",Michael Laguardia,4.0,"I've been a huge fan of buying 1-to-2-generation old refurbished Samsung flagship phones. This is my second of them and I know some other people who have done it too and it's a great deal. This phone was top-of-the-line about two years ago. It is still a huge upgrade for me, replacing my 4-year-old Galaxy S10e that i obtained similarly back then. Very cheap, I was able to get this one for $235 which is a steal, this is much better than new phones in the same price range.Things I like about this phone: it's relatively small, very fast, the display is super crisp. It's great at getting signal, and wireless networks and bluetooth pairing all work beautifully. I usually talk with a headset but phone calls without a headset are fine. The camera is great quality-wise.Things I dislike about this phone: I would prefer it to be smaller. Phones keep getting bigger. The Galaxy S10e was slightly bigger than I like, and this one got a little bigger AND heavier. It feels bulky in my pocket. Also I don't like the location of the camera, because it tends to make the cases for this phone be very thin near the edge of the phone, which tends to make them break in that spot. And this is a design flaw with the phone, not the case, because the way the phone is made there is an area around the cameras that bumps out in such a way that makes it so you can't make that part of the case thicker. iPhones did a better job of this design, allowing for a slightly thicker piece of case.And the other downside is the bloatware. Samsung is awful for the bloatware. there are some notifications that are very hard to turn off, like the one about ""Find Your Phone"". Samsung is constantly pressuring you to sign into their service, and it makes it very difficult to sign out. Two-factor authentication required to sign out? What a farce. This phone made me very frustrated at the people who designed it.Lastly, the other things I really dislike about this phone, which unfortunately follows industry trends. There is no 3.5mm jack. I used that heavily and I really miss that. It's a big downside because now I can't use corded headsets, which I prefer in part because you don't have to change them. AND this does not have a removable battery.The battery going is usually the reason I have to replace my phone, so lacking a replaceable battery limits the lifetime of the phone. Replacing the battery is affordable if I can do it myself, if I have to drive to a store and pay someone to open the phone up to replace the battery, it's not really worth it. So basically the lack of replaceable battery makes this phone shorter-lived for me...especially since the battery life is perhaps not quite as good as it could be. It's not terrible, but you really do need to turn power saving on from the start. I also recommend charging only to 80% to prolong the life, and then just charging more frequently. This device seems to run a little hot which tends to make batteries wear out fast, so definitely watch that.With these limitations, I think this phone is still a great buy. But it does have some design flaws that unfortunately Samsung has not addressed in their newer phones. The whole industry has been moving in the wrong direction IMHO, planned obsolescence, making their devices non-repairable. I hate it. And because of it I refuse to buy new products. Buying old products like this is my way of protesting the industry. I refuse to pump big money into an industry that isn't representing my values and the things I care about in life.","July 21, 2024"

Screen is hard to keep clean almost looks like it is not the original screen.  Can deal with that.  The main problem is the sound.

Was skeptical of the model 901w since many have posted reviews of it being only usable in Canada. Although, it is the model from Canada, I had no problems activating it on my Verizon network. I would have given the seller 5 stars but my phone arrived with no sim card tray. Therefore making it very inconvenient to activate the phone in the time frame that I was trying to do so. The seller did correct the mistake and I had no problem communicating with the seller. For all the given reasons is why I gave the seller 4 stars and not 5.

There is literally no issue with this phone, it charges great and has a great battery life, no cracks or chips or anything. The face recognition is a bit buggy so I chose not to use it, but I think that is more of samsung's fault more than anything else. Also for the fingerprint reader, it works great but for those who don't know, if you have a screen protector, you have to look through settings to make the screen more sensitive so that it goes through better (its labeled as such under settings>display>touch sensitivity). Otherwise, great phone that can handle a great amount of pictures and apps.","May 29, 2024"

Needs a charge in the afternoon if I've used it heavily that day. So I got a power pack and that helps, but it's a shame I needed to do that.As for the fingerprint sensor, it just doesn't work half the time. S22 locks you out if you try repeatedly, and then you have to wait a while before it lets you try again.It came in almost-like-new condition but not in original packaging, no clear plastic protecting the glass, and without the quick start guide, which is downloadable (and I didn't need it). What I needed was the Samsung Smart Switch app, which sync'd my S9 apps, though not my app data. For example my voice-recorder data is still stuck on the old phone, not sure how to get that moved.Another minus was I couldn't get real accident insurance from Samsung or my carrier so I would have to go with 3rd party. Too much fine print for me to believe it's any good, so I'm `self-insured'. if I break the screen, it's never going to have any trade-in value and then I'll be looking for another refurb in the $400 price range. Better than paying like $200 for insurance and possibly deductibles for the next few years.","September 19, 2023"

"Samsung Galaxy S22 Smartphone, Factory Unlocked Android Cell Phone, 128GB, 8K Camera & Video, Brightest Display, Long Battery Life, Fast 4nm Processor, US Version, Phantom Black (Renewed)",Emmanuel,2.0,"I've been looking for a Galaxy S22, not a + nor an Ultra, because it's smaller, about the same size as my S10E, but much faster and more powerful.  I cannot tell how this reconditioned one, costing half what a new one cost, is different from new.  Transferring all my data and apps left only re-entering passwords and setting ring tones. So far, it's been the most seamless upgrade I've gone through for a cell phone.Update: after 2 days I'm pretty sure I'm keeping this phone. It's only about 1/8"" longer than the S10E it's replacing and is actually a bit lighter.  I had a few minor issues such as moving over Memo Pad--it whined about it being for older systems and Memo Pad Tools transferred the data to the wrong directory, but that was easily worked around. WhatsApp crashed and I had to reinstall but it's fine now. Battery life, which has been a problem in many reviews, is still better than the S10E... So far so good!Removing one star because getting this phone unlocked has turned out to be more problematic than it should be.  It's a T-Mobile phone, but T-Mo cannot unlock it (they tried) because it's been reconditioned. T-Mo contacted Samsung, no luck there either.  I tried an unlock service, they couldn't, and kept my $28 and won't refund it.  I've gone back to Amazon, on T-Mo's recommendation, and they are contacting the seller to try to get the phone unlocked.  I LIKE that it's a T-Mobile phone because it gives you free WiFi calling anywhere there's Internet, but I need it to be unlocked so I can use local SIMs when I travel.  I really prefer to have only one phone, and not have to play the risky game of switching SIM chips.  A dual SIM phone is useless for that if it cannot be unlocked.  So, until this is resolved, I'm not going to activate the eSIM and will use the SIM chip I had in my old phone.Final remark. Usually a phone can be unlocked but this one cannot. Not by a 3rd party unlocking service, not by Samsung, the manufacturer, not by T-Mobile, to whom the phone is attached, and not even by the vendor who wrote to me:""Unfortunately we can't guarantee that these stock of phones are able to be unlocked. This is why we are selling them as locked to a specific carrier. We also are unable to assist in unlocking this phone since we sold it as locked.""I'm leaving it at 2 stars because the vendor and Amazon are allowing me to return it. I've wiped the phone, which I really liked, and am forced to order a new one from Samsung at double the price, but if it cannot be unlocked then it defeats the purpose of buying it, which is to be able to use other carriers' SIM chips, specifically ALIV.","February 8, 2023"

One, Mint is now owned by T-Mobile.  That apparently doesn't matter. Two Federal law mandates paid for phones must be unlocked by carriers. Apparently  T-mobile thinks this law applies only its customers. They won't unlock the phone unless you are a paying customer which I am not.

I like to listen to organ music....... gorgeous sound. Visuals are sharp.  I think this is a fantastic phone. However, my puppy found it one day and put a couple of teeth marks on it.  So now the phone still works on the front as usual, but when you open it, the screens are black.  I tried to fix it but haven't been able to.

I get a lot of people asking me about it. It feels weighted/sturdy without being heavy so it's not as easy to drop, has impressive camera quality and of course the flip function. It is a soft close so you can't snap it shut with the flick of your wrist, so I'm not worried about hinge damage. The screen is comfortable to hold despite its 6.8"" size. The cover screen is  easy to navigate (short tutorial provided) and gives you plenty of space to see your notifications. I've noticed bugs like with YouTube Music once I got this phone, it started skipping forward in the song, which my S20 did not do however this is probably fixable? The phone is super new so updates may take care of this hopefully.Also note the lavender option is pink with maybe purple undertones so you will be disappointed if you expect purple. I like pink so I'm fine with it.if you want the same specs as their Ultra versions, you may be disappointed. I personally love the camera (and have gotten compliments on it) and I can wait until the end of the day before I charge this, but I've heard people point out that Samsung's other phones are more advanced like with a bigger battery, higher camera MP, etc but I don't think the average consumer needs super high numbers in those areas. I don't regret my choice at all and I actually think this phone is still a better investment than other models. It's hard to beat a touch-screen flip phone and everything looks great to the eye. I am overall pleased and I recommend. Will update if anything changes.","September 17, 2023"

By being able to fold the phone, you still get a large screen but in a format that fits comfortably in a pant or shirt pocket.Concerns I had were the slight ripple in the glass where the glass bends.  Often when watching YouTube I'd forget about it & only remember when sliding my finger across the screen feeling the smooth divot.  the other concern was about the hinges.  So far so good.  I specifically purchased the more expensive Galaxy Flip-5 vs the Razor because reviews made it sound like Razor hadn't worked out all the kinks.I'm not a heavy phone user so typically I have about 60% charge by the time I go to sleep at night.  The most I've ever got the battery down to was in the high 30% range.  The phone hasn't gotten hot while using or gotten funky.  Still figuring out how to use the half screen in the front but so far very happy.","September 4, 2024"

It was super easy to set up and transfer data from my old phone. I did have to go into Verizon to transfer text messages, but they did it for free since they’re my provider. Alert: if you’re like me and don’t normally delete conversations, start early. I had over 45,000 texts, paring that number to 13,000 before transferring texts (hanging my head in shame).

Just to make sure it didn't tear up. But I still love it. Honestly, I never dreamed that I would pay over $1000. On a phone. But I was a fan of the original razor phone. And I have been wanting this since they started making it. So they had it where I could make payments. So I got it. It's got a amazing screen. You can't even see the bend unless you're just looking for it. You can feel it a little. But it has all the features that a iPhone has. Hell I actually like it better than a iPhone. It takes amazing pictures. Has a perfect sized screen. I have vision problems, but I don't struggle to see things on this device. It's got loud enough speakers. Watching videos are loud and clear. I couldn't be happier. I highly recommend. But if it breaks in the next little bit I will update my review.","May 29, 2024"
"SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Flip5 AI Phone, 256GB Unlocked Android Smartphone, Compact, Foldable Design, One-Hand Control, Best Selfies, Full Cover Screen, Hands-Free Use, US Version, 2023, Mint",MrsC,3.0,Honestly I was so excited for this phone. It's nice because it really fits in your pocket and it's convenient easy to get etc etc. But once I've actually had it for a few months I realize it really isn't as good as I thought it was. It glitches a lot it's not really fast and the strength of the magnet of closing it and opening it kind of wears off pretty quickly. Also having the built-in screen protector is very frustrating because it gets scratched up but there's not really a way to replace it unless you want to go specifically to a Samsung store to get it replaced. I kind of regret getting the phone but it is nice because you put it in your pocket and it doesn't fall out if you have small pockets. Also you get a lot of comments about it so that's something. I just think that it really needs an upgrade and a bit more work before it's fully ready. Also the battery life is literally one of the worst I have ever dealt with. I practically have to keep my phone plugged in all the time for it to survive a day. It's pretty ridiculous,"March 8, 2024"

The hinge is very sturdy, and it feels nice. The crease is noticeable, but it has just disappeared from my vision. If you buy this, make sure to take good care of it, as folding phones are more delicate than normal ones. Otherwise, the folding ability is great and makes it very convenient. The outer screen is also great because you can use the main cameras for a selfie, and you can even fold it to prop it up on something.","June 3, 2024"

I had been eyeing this phone for a while and thoroughly researched Youtube videos for reviews, comparisons, and setup tips. No regret. I wanted a small phone that can fit in pockets or small purse that took excellent photos: Does that. Previous models didn't close tight once folded and I felt could get caught in things in the mess of my purse. This one closes tight and yet is very easy to open. The cover screen is super convenient once you download the apps recommended by Youtubers. The ability to use the phone closed, open, or at an angle is also very convenient. Battery life is rather good (followed the battery saver recommended). Paired with a minimalist clear matte cover + a cover screen for the outside screen (purchased on Amazon): all fit absolutely perfectly. The inside screen already has a soft protection. Love that it is seriously water resistant. Before a phone was just a necessity, but I actually love this one.","November 20, 2023"

When folded, it fits nicely in your pocket.  The initial phone I received lasted me just over 3 months.  The crease where the inner main screen bends as you open and close the phone developed a blacked-out bar and the phone would no longer function.  Within minutes, the entire screen started going black as well.  It was too late for me to return the phone to Amazon, so I contacted Samsung.  They made me go through their mail-in repair service (a process that can take 2 weeks).  Samsung has the option to fix or send you a new phone.  In my case, they sent me a new one (after about 10 days).  Getting a new phone meant that all my apps and data had to be reinstalled and reconfigured (a real inconvenience).  But, At least I have a working Z Flip 5 again.  Nevertheless, I'm very worried that the new phone won't last because of the constant bending of the screen.  I like to keep my phones for at least 3-4 years, and this phone, with the screen being bent numerous times per day, does not instill long-term confidence.  Samsung's warranty only allows for free repair and/or replacement one time (during the first year of ownership only).  I've used my ""one time"" and now I'm on my own if the screen goes bad again.  After one month, the 2d phone is doing okay, but only time will tell if it's going to hold up or not.","January 13, 2024"

This phone is amazing and is definitely a fantastic upgrade from the three and even the four from what I've seen. After downloading both Theme Park and Good Lock apps, I see this phone as even better with freedom to use the cover screen for all applications (mileage may vary) and customizing the phone in general. I have a hard time thinking of ways they can make this phone better aesthetically. Of course they can improve it in the form of software updates, battery life, and of course the camera but even with that said, I love Samsung's flip phones and I highly recommend this one.","November 8, 2023"

I'm so glad I did. Right off the bat, the only con is the slight crease. It doesn't bother me at all, but I can definitely feel it, and can definitely see it in some angles. Also the screen protector can be somewhat difficult to install.Pros: Battery life is great, camera is amazing, the screen is super responsive/smooth, and the front screen is such a cool feature, and so useful.I find myself flipping the phone shut as soon as I'm done using it and that's really helped me with my screen time. Sort of out of sight, out of mind. And because I can flip it shut, I can tuck it into smaller spaces. It even fits in my front pocket! This is unheard of for me.And the phone cases?? So cute.

UbreakiFix, Samsung's authorized repair provider nearby, told me to go through Samsung's mail-in repair service as they didn't have parts to fix. They also told me that Samsung would send a replacement.However, it turned out that I don't qualify for a replacement because I bought my phone on Amazon, not directly from Samsung. This doesn't make sense to me, considering it is still a Samsung store on Amazon.com. Samsung told me that my only option is to use the mail-in repair service, which will take about two weeks. This is my first experience dealing with Samsung, and I am not impressed at all in terms of the quality of the phone and service.Most importantly, if the screen gets damaged again after the first free repair, the cost will be entirely on me. Given what has already happened, I believe there is a high likelihood of this occurring again.","December 24, 2023"

We needed to replace one which the screen went black after 16 months. This model gives the best bang for your buck. My criteria were ≤$200, good cameras & photos, water resistance, good battery, good screen, Android 14, fast processor, 6GB RAM, 128GB storage, and usb-c connectivity. The A52 is a hidden gem and is a better quality build than its successors. The device I received is in excellent renewed condition. There was no splash branding even though it's T-Mobile unlocked. All functions work, including 5g network (Red Pocket prepaid service). Overall, this is a great mid-range smartphone!","April 14, 2024"
"Samsung Galaxy A52 (5G) 128GB A526U (T-Mobile/Sprint Unlocked) 6.5"" Display Quad Camera Smartphone - Black (Renewed)",Drumdogma,5.0,"After my Pixel 3a got accidentally water logged when my kid's water bottle spilled in the car, I hemmed and hawed a lot over what phone to get.  I loved my pixel but most of the models were currently out of stock and I didn't really want to keep waiting for the new releases, so I did my research and landed on this phone.  So I will do my review relative to the pixel 3a I previously owned:1. The photo quality is comparable to or maybe better than the pixel 3a in my opinion (I'm not really an expert here)- the pictures look crisp and detailed which is important to me as mostly I take my kids pictures with my phone.2.  The battery life of this phone is much better.  It can last me the whole day.  At 10 pm I still have 30% battery and I was on my phone a lot- mostly browsing but did watch a little youtube also.3. Screen size is bigger on this phone- if you are looking to put it in a pocket this may be a bit big.  Since I carry it in my purse I don't mind, and I kind of enjoy the big screen for my youtube habit.  Picture quality when watching video seems superior also.4. Bloatware apps- annoying.  The pixel definitely felt way cleaner out of the gate.  On this phone I had to delete a lot of apps and then disable or hide away in folders others that can't be deleted.  In the end it's not a dealbreaker for me, but it created some pain in the initial setup of the phone.5.  This phone has facial recognition, but it hasn't been working that great for me.  I will probably try to go in and redo it and see if it improves at all.  It would be nice if it worked- but mostly I am using the fingerprint sensor.  I actually preferred the physical fingerprint sensor on the back of the pixel because it worked consistently, and the one built into the screen on this phone seems a bit finnicky.  Overall this one has more ""advanced"" unlock features but I preferred the reliability on the pixel.I know this comparison is only so good because Pixel already has a 4a and soon a 5a, but maybe it will help someone.  Overall I am happy because I got a nice camera, great battery life, and nice video quality on a mid range phone.  The Amazon renewed phone had no defects at all that I could tell.  I don't think the charger with it was original, but it was certainly worth the savings for the renewed price.One more tip- I hated the Samsung keyboard for some reason.  So I downloaded the google Gboard on it which made me much happier.","August 14, 2021"

Love the oled display, it's pretty fast too. The only thing that I was confused about was the title listed that it was a Tmobile/Sprint unlocked device. The one I received was an AT&T unlocked phone. Not a big issue as it works for t-mobile. When I powered it on the first time I thought I was going to have to send it back as it turns on with AT&T's carrier logo.

I saw other reviewers that said they had issues getting it connected to Verizon's network.  The phone has 2 sim card slots one for CDMA and one for GSM.  You need to make sure the Verizon sim card is in the appropriate sim slot in order to get the phone to connect.  The GSM slot (AT&T's network) was actually easier to get to as it was on top, and we had to try both slots to figure out which one was the correct CDMA slot.

There appear to be 4 different versions of this phone in the US. The SM-G715A is ATT only and is currently listed on the ATT website as compatible. The SM-G715V is Verizon only. The SM-G715U is supposed to be unlocked but ATT does not currently list it as compatible on their website. It is supposed to work on Verizon. This might account for some of the problems that have been reported. It is also possible that the 3G shutdown last year caused problems for any phone, carrier or plan still using it. The SM-G715U1 is factory unlocked with no carrier specific bloatware on the one I received. I put a Page Plus Verizon MVNO SIM into it and it immediately started working with no trouble. ATT specifically lists the U1 model (but not the U) as compatible with ATT but I have not tried it. I ran the IMEI against the T-Mobile compatibility checker and it showed compatible but have not tried it. None of the Galaxy Xcover PRO models appear to be compatible with Spectrum Mobile available only to Spectrum internet customers. Although Spectrum advertises a BYOD option and runs on Verizon, they only accept a limit number of higher end phones and this isn't one of them. Bottom line seems to be if you want an XCover PRO that is compatible with most providers and carriers, get the U1 model but check with your cell provider first. You might have to pay a little extra for this one. If you only need Verizon or ATT you might save money with the carrier specific ""V"" or ""A"" versions or even the ""U"" version for Verizon. The factory box should be marked with the model and you can always check the ""About Phone"" option under ""Settings""  for the exact model if there are problems activating. Running the IMEI against the provider or carrier's website or contacting your provider and have them check it should also work but of course you have to have the phone in hand to do either one. When buying a phone off the internet, the option to return it if it doesn't work or is not as advertised is something to consider.","March 24, 2023"

Make sure Sims is in the right slot #1. Link it to the proper network, information on Google how to. This is not like your active phone if that is what you are hoping but is an OK replacement.So after a week I'm changing my review, this phone is junk, trash, on par with Trac phone, but less quality. These so called ""new"" phones are used did not even clear the history or delete previous files (super sorry Debra hope you man gets over his porn addiction) cashe completely full. Want maps better buy one. 4gLTE on this device is dial-up my samsung galaxy active8 is faster in same location and has not been updated in 18months. Don't worry about an otter box ships back to Amazon just fine the way it is. From 4 stars when first started to 1 after a week, did I mention deleting files? Debra don't throw stones in a glass house your porn was still in history. Third week in they misspelled POS and put PRO slightly better than a Trac phone until u turn the Trac phone on then blows this phone out of the water. Nonstop network resets and contact losses are what u pay for.","May 21, 2022"

I absolutely love this phone! Might not have 5G, but neither does most of the places I actually travel to in the states. Willing to bet this phone will definitely last me until 5G is a commonplace as 4G is now, then I'll upgrade to the 6 Pro that includes it at a steep discount like this new XCOVER Pro was. $300 for a more than capable, durable and stylish phone. Some reviews are misleading, wireless charging is not included on this model but is very easily(and hella cheaply) added. The back plate is removable with just a finger nail so adding wireless charging, a new extended battery or just dealing in an extra battery for power when charging is unavailable is very easy. Very durable and ip68 rated so a great first phone for your kids or great for us clumsy folk that are 30-40+yr old kids.","November 15, 2022"
SAMSUNG Electronics Galaxy 4G LTE Xcover PRO Rugged (IP Rated) Unlocked (Verizon & AT&T) | Dual Sim | US Version (2022 Model) |64GB of Storage |US Warranty | Black - SM-G715UZKFXAA,"Good phone, it was renewed but in new condition -and it  really like it is. Only, so sad that I got it without original box. From other side, in the box with phone was good charger, that’ s so pleasure! Thanks!",3.0,"A quick summary to start: The phone itself is 4 stars. The lying about shipping and being available is a 1 star, thus the 3 star average (rounded up).I have this phone and have had it for years. The phone overall was great.Pros:- Durable (gets dropped a lot, even from height). It is in a case, but even so it has been dropped out of the case a couple times. I would say some of the falls it has had would've shattered any other phone.- The replacement battery is nice for when out-and-about and don't have an additional power bank on me. The extra battery is smaller than a power bank and easier to have on me.- The fingerprint reader is quick and responsive.- The speed and responsiveness overall is good. It even handles running multiple apps at a time well (either split screen or window in window).- Works good in the rain and with gloves.Cons:- Screen is barely visible in the daylight. Sometimes even in shady areas it is faint.- It is considered a business phone, so trying to get one through Verizon (or AT&T) is difficult to say the least.I had purchased this one as I finally dropped my current xCover Pro one time too many. It still works, but there is a loose connection now on the inside for the display and requires a clamp to keep the screen on. If the clamp is not in the exact place, it will not properly respond to any input. It cannot be fixed by the typical iFixIt shops because it is the 'active' version of the phone and there is no access (at least that is what the people at the iFixIt shops told me). I figured the price was right for a replacement and It stated I could get it the next day with Prime, so even better.So I order this one 2 days ago and it said it would be here yesterday. Then yesterday it said it would be today. Now it is saying Friday?!?!? Don't state that I can get something tomorrow or the next day if it is going to take 5+ days to get here (if not delayed even more). That is a cheap bait-and-switch tactic. Unfortunately I cannot cancel this order for some reason until after Friday, which means I am also out the money to get another replacement phone.Again, I would still recommend this phone to be used in rugged environments. As with any phone though, you should still use a case and screen protector. Rugged is only so rugged after all. I would not buy the phone from here unless your phone isn't currently broken and you don't need a quick replacement. If you can wait a week (or more) then sure, go ahead and order from here. This listing should not say that it can arrive next day as it does currently.","November 2, 2022"

I really like this phone coming from a conventional handset.  Some of my ideal phone criteria are:- Compact device- Mainstream/higher end performance- DurabilityHere is why this phone works for me.- Size:  My previous phone was S10e.  Yes it was old but I liked the compact size compared to many larger phones these days.  Even the standard S24 is bigger.  Although it is thicker, I like the fact that it fits in my pocket comfortably.- Performance:  It has the latest processor, 512GB of storage and 12 gig of memory.  The camera is now on par with other premium devices and now is truly considered a flagship device.  All good.- Durability:  Don't get me wrong...  The flip phone will probably never be as durable as a conventional handset, but the Z flip now has dust protection in addition to moisture protection.  Now that Samsung has gone through several life cycles, I feel comfortable using the fold devices.- Price:  People complain that the price went up by $100.  There are deals to be had and ways to bring down the price.Summary:My old S10e did pretty much everything that newer phones do in terms of the features. including wireless pay and reverse charging.  The only reason for me to look for a new phone was to address the failing (aging) battery.  As it is a good time for me to look for a new device, I wanted to considering something different and new.  The Z flip added the folding ""trick"", and it is a welcoming change.  One, I can mostly triage messages and etc on the cover screen and minimize the big screen.  Two, the main screen, because of its oddly long aspect ratio, works pretty well working with 2 separate windows.  It is very useful.  I like the new form factor and the functions that it adds.","August 19, 2024"

"SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Flip 6 AI Cell Phone, 512GB Unlocked Android Smartphone, FlexCam, Photo Assist, Camcorder Mode, Live Interpreter, Foldable Design, 2024, US 1 Yr Manufacturer Warranty, Silver Shadow",userNO12345,5.0,"I recently got the SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Flip 6 AI Cell Phone with 256GB of storage, and it has been an amazing upgrade. Here’s my personal take on this innovative device:Design and BuildThe first thing that struck me was the sleek and stylish design. The folding mechanism is smooth and feels incredibly robust. When folded, it’s compact and fits perfectly in my pocket, making it super convenient to carry around. Unfolding it reveals a gorgeous, vibrant display that’s perfect for everything from browsing to watching videos.DisplayThe main display is stunning. It’s bright, colorful, and the flexible screen is just so cool to use. Watching videos and scrolling through apps is a delightful experience. Plus, the secondary display on the outside is handy for quickly checking notifications, time, and other essential information without having to open the phone.PerformancePerformance-wise, this phone is a beast. The AI features are impressive, making the phone feel incredibly responsive and intuitive. Whether I’m multitasking, gaming, or using demanding apps, everything runs smoothly without any hiccups. The 256GB of storage is more than enough for all my apps, photos, videos, and files. I don’t have to worry about running out of space, which is a huge plus.CameraThe camera setup is another highlight. The photos and videos are crisp, clear, and vibrant, even in low light. The foldable design allows for some creative photography angles and hands-free selfies, which I’ve been having a lot of fun with.Battery LifeBattery life is pretty solid. It easily lasts me through a full day of heavy use, and the fast charging is a lifesaver when I need a quick boost. I haven’t had any issues with battery performance, which is always a concern with high-end smartphones.User ExperienceUsing the Galaxy Z Flip 6 feels futuristic. The interface is user-friendly, and the AI integration helps with daily tasks, making everything feel seamless. I also appreciate the customization options that let me tweak the phone to my preferences.DurabilityOne thing I was initially worried about was the durability of the foldable screen. However, after using it for a while, I can say that it feels sturdy and well-built. I’m careful with it, of course, but it doesn’t feel fragile.Final ThoughtsOverall, I’m extremely happy with the SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Flip 6 AI Cell Phone. It’s a perfect blend of cutting-edge technology and stylish design. The foldable aspect is more than just a gimmick—it’s a functional feature that adds real value to the user experience. If you’re looking for something innovative and powerful, this phone is definitely worth considering.","August 5, 2024"

Model phone in-store had it as well. Discovered it is not physical damage but a quality assurance/ software issue from Samsung. After purchasing it directly from Samsung's site, I was sent to a store for pick-up, and the store sold it significantly cheaper only a day later.

Since this phone does not include a wall charger, I had to scramble to find a way to charge it.I'd prefer that anxiety not be a part of my new user experience!This phone comes with the bare minimum of instructions. I would like that a full new user guide be included in my desired new user bundle!Since the minimalist instructions did not mention how to actually fold this Fold, I had to take a risk and bend it like...I might be about to break it. Thankfully it bent folded very easily!This Z Flip 6 is about as wide as my iPhone SE, which I can now no longer call my 'old"" phone. Since Spectrum won't activate this new one it has now been reinstated as just my plain old ""phone"". I like that the width of this new Fold is about the same as my SE because I do not have to relearn how to hold this new phone.I like that this phone folds because I am accustomed to storing my SE in a small outer pocket of my purse. When folded this Flip can fit into the same pocket.This Z Flip 6 seems to suck down it's battery life at about 1% per hour when fully opened, however, it charges very quickly. I am not an expert on mobile phones so it's entirely possible that something that I have running is causing the rapid loss of battery life.I had another small bout with anxiety when I decided to see how my music sounded on this Fold. Without a user's manual I had to look on the internet to see where my music went. I learned that my music files went to You Tube music. I love You Tube so that was okay with me. My music sounds great on this phone!I am disappointed that I cannot currently use this Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 AI Cell Phone as my mobile phone unless I am willing to sign up with another mobile carrier and get a new phone number and have two mobile phones. No thanks.I think that the sales page for this and for all mobile phones should include a warning to check with your mobile carrier before purchase. Since this Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 AI Cell Phone does not carry that warning I am deducting one star from my review.Four stars.","July 29, 2024"
"SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Flip 6 AI Cell Phone, 512GB Unlocked Android Smartphone, FlexCam, Photo Assist, Camcorder Mode, Live Interpreter, Foldable Design, 2024, US 1 Yr Manufacturer Warranty, Silver Shadow",Dil rai,4.0,"The SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Flip 6 AI Cell Phone I received for review did not come with a sim card and me being technologically challenged as I am, did not know I needed one to activate and to connect the phone to my cellular plan and be able to make phone calls (every phone I have owned came with one already installed or was preinstalled for me when I purchased it). This does come with 2 slots for nano cards, just be careful when you place the card in the phone, you must use the tray or else the card will just fall into the phone and is almost impossible to get out without professional help.After spending an afternoon at the Samsung store, they finally were able to get my sim card out and showed me the proper way to install it (using the tray) and since the phone comes unlocked, I was able to go to my provider afterwords and easily add the phone to my plan.  The phone itself works and looks great and is loaded with some nice new features previously unavailable to the older versions. I ended up doing what I normally do with new technology and just play around with it to learn things on my own, since the included directions are the bare minimum to get started. I have not been through all the features, but the ones I have messed around with work great, like the live translator, just point the smaller screen to the person you are trying to talk too, and it will translate the language onto the main screen you are looking at. I can see this coming in very handy to people who like to travel. I have tested this feature out with my mother speaking Italian and the translation was good enough to understand what she was saying, not verbatim, but good enough to get the point across.  The app does not come installed on the phone but is free to download and it supports 17 languages that I have seen listed. The other feature I have messed around with is the camera and by using the smaller screen you are able to see the picture you are taking as you are taking it which is great if you are into selfies. I am not a big phone user and do not always have my face buried in one, so I am not constantly flipping the phone open and closed, and even the way that I use it, the main screen still has developed a slightly more noticeable crease at the fold point, and this is only my 2nd full day using it. I guess I can always just use the smaller screen on the outside of the phone, instead of opening and closing it, to help mitigate the crease. You can customize the smaller screen to access almost every app and function on the phone to include the ability to send messages without ever having to flip open the phone. Overall, once I finally got the phone up and running it is a great phone that I am more than happy with. I have only used it for 2 full days and will update my review if I should encounter any unexpected problems with it. I really wish they would put sticker warnings on things like use tray to install card and I could have saved myself an afternoon.","July 31, 2024"

I genuinely LOVE the fingerprint reader located on the side power button. It makes unlocking the phone a breeze and in my month or two of using it, it has been a flawless process. The phone itself is very attractive and eye catching (have gotten multiple comments on it at work). The folding mechanic in conjunction with Google Translate can make for a very helpful experience when travelling. The Samsung Galaxy/Android user experience was very nice, no complaints. Camera was pretty much on par with previous Pixel phones in my experience.The phone is generally much more sensitive to dirt/sand due to folding mechanics (be very careful at the beach!) While not horrible, the actual fold crease in the screen is a bit annoying especially if you watch a lot of media on your phone the way I do. Screen seems to have more glare than previous smartphone (I believe this is due to the foldable screen protector) and it always just looks a little lumpy in the middle of the screen when you have it fully open.Ability to add apps to home screen is very helpful (although it requires an additional app that doesn't come default with the phone) but, otherwise, the limited amount of dedicated widgets for the cover screen was a bit disappointing. The AI features while potentially fun, really didn't seem to use much of a functional purpose to me, but might appeal to a younger user.  It does get points for being much more comfortable in my pocket and being very compact.Ultimately, I think if you are not bothered by the fold in the screen because you don't watch movies on your phone regularly and you are looking for an ultra compact phone with all the bells and whistles, this is a great option for you.","August 31, 2024"

Okay that's enough of reminiscing and now to the pros and cons of this phone. Keep in mind I'm upgrading from an old Samsung S10+.PROS:*TMobile 5G UC (ultra capacity) Network Up to 10GB/second for data. Internet speed is way faster than my old 4G connectivity.*Button Fingerprint reader, no more on screen fingerprint reading. Very responsive and accurate. Now that the fingerprint reader is on the button I'm wondering why it took them so long to do this. If my screen is damaged on my S10 I will not be able to access any of my apps that uses biometrics which happened to me recently.*4000mAH battery can go the distance. Been using this phone for a week and the battery has been able to last the whole day with average use of the phone and not having to have it plugged in all the time.CONS:* No expandable memory card slot only built in 256GB or 512GB internal memory. I'm so use to having an expandable memory card slot that I'm kinda sad that Samsung didn't include one with this phone. After transferring everything from my old phone to new phone I only have 15gb of memory left... time to transfer old pics and vids off to my laptop.*Will not work with existing car mount charger. Need to move phone up 2-3 inches. Not a problem at the moment since all I need to do is move the phone a bit higher on my car mount charger which works with wireless charging. I'm looking into a magsafe car mount but need to get a magsafe case which I'm not willing to do at this point. I'm loving my SUPCASE which fits perfectly with this phone.*Folding display does not show crease when display is on, only shows when  screen is completely off. This is not a problem when screen is on you don't really notice it. What one would expect from a folding screen.","August 9, 2024"
"SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Flip 6 AI Cell Phone, 512GB Unlocked Android Smartphone, FlexCam, Photo Assist, Camcorder Mode, Live Interpreter, Foldable Design, 2024, US 1 Yr Manufacturer Warranty, Silver Shadow",DynomiteWins,4.0,"This review is for the SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Flip 6 AI Cell Phone, 256GB Unlocked Android Smartphone.This is my first full screen flip phone. I like the small size when folded, but don't think being able to fold it makes it worth the price. I wonder how long the inside screen will last where it folds. Samsung offers a one time $200 interior screen replacement warranty within 2 years to the original owner so that's a plus although $200 is still a lot.Folded the phone is about 3.25in x 2.75in x 0.75in. The front cover screen is nice. When locked/asleep, if there is a text or notification received it shows a small red dot to let you know. You have to wake the screen up and unlock it to see the notification, or even what kind of notification it was which is kind of a pain.Once unlocked, I have it set to see notifications if I swipe right. There are also limited basic apps that offer widgets for the cover screen such as calendar, calculator, clock, contacts, samsung gallery, phone calls, reminders, weather, voice recorder, news, health etc.  The phone widget allows me to add 4 contacts that I can speed dial without unfolding the phone. The only apps currently available on the cover screen are Google maps, messages, Netflix, WhatsApp and YouTube.When unfolded, the phone is a little skinner than my old Galaxy A53. I'd like the screen a little wider, but maybe I just have to get used to it more. The screen also has a different, plasticky feel to it since it is not glass.Other than that, you can find and read about the specs and features online. I find it to be a very good phone. I just don't think one needs to spend so much to get a good quality phone.","August 6, 2024"

She wasn't a big fan of the Google phone and had like Samsung's in the past so I thought we would try this one.  The phone feels substantial and very solid in the hand, with crisp, easy to use buttons for volume.  The battery life so are has been very good which is important since we live in an area where coverage can be spotty.  It also works with the variety of Qi wireless chargers we have in our home and office.  Not sure all that sure about the folding feature? It makes the phone into a compact little square, but also then thicker and I don;t see how that is an advantage when in the pocket, other than protecting the main screen?  Speaking of the main screen, my partner has folded the phone a few times and when you unfold it there is a ripple or slight crease in the screen when you first open it.  It does seem to relax fairly quickly once open, but as many other reviews have mentioned this looks to be a point of failure for the future.  My partner doesn't care about the phone being folded and just keeps it flat all the time.  The screen is about 1/2"" longer than her pixel was so its not noticeably bigger if it's in your pocket.  She has been using the voice activated features and has found that to be convenient.  The phone learned her voice quite easily with repeating a group of phrases as part of the set up and hasn't misunderstood anything since.  Overall a decent phone so far and will update this review as time goes on, if anything noteworthy arises or changes.","August 1, 2024"

You get a great camera, the smoothest software and a big cover screen. With that being said, the Z Flip 6 with its vibrant colors & sturdy frame is one of the best looking phones and the form factor is so comfy to hold, put in your pocket or your purse.The cover screen is very useful, I find myself trying to use it most of the time, the main screen is also beautiful and brighter than last year.Everything is quick and all the apps run perfectly. Making calls and hanging up by closing the flip is still fun after all these years since the original flips!Overall I enjoyed using the phone for everyday use.Now to the really bad part which takes at least 1 star off my rating and it's the cameras! The selfie camera is a joke and shouldn't be allowed on a phone with that price.The main camera, with 50 mega pixels, is barely performing even in bright light outdoors.  I would expect it to be on par with most middle of the line phones  out there, but the pixel line kicks its butt and so does the iPhone pro!The battery was just slightly better than last year, barely making it to the end of the day, most likely will need a second charge later in the day with moderate or slightly heavy phone use.Overall, I like the phone, I would pull the trigger only if you really don't care about the camera, everything else about the phone is fun!","July 29, 2024"

I love how sleek it looks this year as I have always preferred the matte look for the sides and back glass. Its design, the confident clap when it closes, and guaranteed 7 years of updates make me confident in the long term support. I was having so much fun taking pictures of and with the flip6. I wish they would have done a couple things different, mainly the outer screen should have been much bigger, even keeping the file shape since it might become a visually distinctive calling card. Honestly the bezels on the cover screen should be halved at least. The buttons on mine also feel like they are loose and can move sides to side :( . I have a genuine hope that the screen and hinge are more durable so I don't have to invoke the insurance. More importantly, I think the performance is great I can play any game I want and I'll put it on all the highest settings, multitasking with the extra height makes using multiple apps a better experience, and the improved camera hardware make excellent images. I'm getting more comfortable using the phone like a camcorder when I record video, it's so cool. Flex mode gives the phone great remote photo options, i want better uses for when the phone is standing like a tent. I  love this phone and highly recommend it especially where carrier offers are good.","August 4, 2024"
"SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Flip 6 AI Cell Phone, 512GB Unlocked Android Smartphone, FlexCam, Photo Assist, Camcorder Mode, Live Interpreter, Foldable Design, 2024, US 1 Yr Manufacturer Warranty, Silver Shadow",Carl J.,5.0,"Going from a much more traditional approx. $200.00 Android phone to the Samsung Galaxy Flip 6 SHOULD be considered a major upgrade, and I was not disappointed. I was very attracted to the significant uptick in photographic quality and honestly was not thinking in terms of the other features, but mostly those are wining me over too.Up front I'm gonna say this, and I may be in the minority here, but I have absolutely zero idea what the cover screen is for. Literally. I can't fathom why it's there. It offers no additional functionality, and mostly seems to be there to look impressive, but to unlock its full capacity (which apparently CAN be done) you have to jump thru a few hoops via online tutorials, and then what have you got? A tiny little screen on the flip side of a much larger and much better screen. So there... that's my one gripe.So, let's talk about the big screen. It's sizable and bright, it has excellent refresh rate, so it moves relatively seamlessly. Scrolling is effortless, and gameplay (of which I do NOT do much...) seems to work very nicely, without lag. There is a slightly noticeable bump in the center at the fold, but that's endemic to the nature of the beast, and it's something you learn rapidly to not be phased by.  It's ultra-widescreen, so viewing in landscape mode pretty much any movie is enjoyable. Go ahead and put on Lawrence of Arabia, it fits!!! And THAT'S a wiiiide screen movie.Video is also a particular joy here. The camera shoots at 4K (I believe that can be adjusted downward if need be) and offers a good, crisp image. The photos attached to the review of water splashing onto rocks are still-frames from the video. Nearly the equal to my Nikon D3400 camera. Low light video looks pretty sharp as well, with minimal grain and excellent blacks. Oh, and this is kind of a weird thing, the sound recording is surprisingly sharp. I don't recall ever having a phone capable of capturing even remotely decent sound, dooming some videos I'd hope to cherish for a long time.I am enjoying a resurgence in flying R/C vehicles and I can tell you this phone has greatly improved the quality of app-connection for wi-fi based drone apps. Of the seven drones I had that would not work on my previous phone only one has not been greatly improved by switching to the Flip 6.I won't lie, there is one other mini-gripe, and that's the AI photo-to art generator. Impressively awkwardly un-recognizable toon versions of myself are cute, and, let's face it, an upgrade from the source image, but if I posted approximately 80 % of them, I've tried no one would have a clue who it was supposed to be. In a couple of them I came out looking surprisingly like a curly haired Mr. Incredible.I didn't expect to love this guy, but it's really grown on me. I love that it folds up and fits neatly in my shirt pocket, I love that it feels rugged and capable, and I love that it works so well.Oh yeah, it also makes and receives phone calls. This is a seldom-mentioned aspect of the Flip 6.I really do love this new phone, and I expect to use it a great deal in my artistic ventures. and THAT is the best compliment I can give it.","August 11, 2024"

"SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Flip 6 AI Cell Phone, 512GB Unlocked Android Smartphone, FlexCam, Photo Assist, Camcorder Mode, Live Interpreter, Foldable Design, 2024, US 1 Yr Manufacturer Warranty, Silver Shadow",Amazon Customer,5.0,"I have never had a flip phone before (unless you count the really old non-smart versions - now I'm dating myself), however this SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Flip 6 AI Cell Phone might just convert me. There are so many advancements I'll touch on just a few given I'm still learning a great deal about this phone.I have been using a Galaxy S22 for the past 2 years and have loved the size and features, particularly the excellent cameras. The Flip 6 unfolded is longer with a 6.7"" screen, and just a smidge wider. If you look really hard at the screen from the side, you can see a very slight bump where the crease is when folded open. However once something is on the screen, I do not notice it at all. The display is truly beautiful. The resolution of 425 ppi makes for a very sharp image on screen. Super easy to read text. The colors on the screen really pop. Given the longer aspect, watching a movie on the screen does not get much bigger than my S22 since the aspect is a wider format. Perhaps cinematic movies will make use of the full display. Speaking of displays, there is a half sized display on the back of the phone (front of the phone when folded closed). Clarity on this smaller screen is excellent as well. It seems to have full functionality as the inside screen. You will want a protective screen cover for this outer screen since it is likely to get scratched otherwise. That includes getting protection for the 2 protuding lenses as well. Note that no screen cover can go on the folded screen for obvious reasons.For cameras, I have been told many times that the color of the photos I have taken with my S22 is better than nearly all others. So I did a comparison with my new Flip 6. Since the resolution on the main camera is 50 MP, the sharpness and detail of the pictures is incredible. The colors are slightly different, but I found it to be slightly more realistic than my S22. You can also set some enhancement defaults to help bring out the best in your photos right from the start.I won't bother to talk about the transition of one phone to another as that is not unique to this phone. It was however quite seamless as I anticipated.The phone came with zero charge on it. I charged it with a super fast charger and it was impressive. Within 15 to 20 minutes, it has gone from 0 to 60 percent. (Sounds like car stats).So far I am liking this phone a great deal. Currently there is a fantastic deal on Amazon so don't wait long.","August 1, 2024"

The first thing I noticed was the fingerprint security lock.  This has been vastly improved and works in a split second, once you set it up.  It was pretty quick to set up, too.This is important because I end up using it repeatedly, and it turns out to be a real timesaver.Of course, I was excited about my new cellphone, but I was also concerned about the migration process.  Possibly because I migrated from a Samsung, to a Samsung, it went quickly and easily.  I had an enormous amount of saved photos and videos, and it swapped them all over without a problem.  It did take about 90 minutes, though.This screen is beautiful, and there is a barely noticeable little raised area in the middle of the screen where you bend it.  It opens and closes easily, and using it in the bent position (""flex mode"") gives you some extra camera options, such as setting it on the table to film without a tripod.Speaking of the camera, focus, lighting etc. is well automated and it takes great shots.  I don't think you can do much better.  There are some AI additions to help you edit your photos and portraits, if you are into that.  The auto frame feature seems to be a thoughtful addition.I found the sound quality to be great, and the bluetooth worked fine after pairing with my  separate JBL speaker.  I also invested in the (new) Ultra watch, which was equally easy to set up on this phone.This phone takes a SIM card, and I installed my T-Mobile Sim card without any problems.  I am also able to make WiFi calls easily.Being a new phone, it is very fast and handles all my apps just fine (They all transferred over).  It plugs into my Dodge Challenger seamlessly, and runs Google maps just fine while I drive.My experience thus far has been simply wonderful.  It's easy to highly recommend this phone, and with the deals out there, the time is right!","August 9, 2024"

Never thought I’d even bother with another brand of phone after a few attempts with Samsung 10-ish years ago. But then they had to go and make something cool.In many respects, it’s quite impressive. The screen resolution is amazingly crisp and color-saturated. The seamless way the unfolded screen fits together is darn-near alien tech. And I like that, when folded, it saves space in purse and pocket. It’s also pretty neat to be able to check notifications without unfolding.But, there are some things I wasn’t fond of. For one thing, running all those beautiful screens really takes a toll on the battery. I was at 50% before I’d barely blinked! To its credit, it does charge quickly, but who wants to factor in recharging while out and about? Speaking of charging, if this phone is your first purchase ever, you will need to buy an outlet block. All you get is the cord. Depends how you plan to charge, though, I guess. A final thought about the screens- I still have massive angst that something stupid will scratch them, even with the included screen protector film.I was also looking forward to the new camera and processor, but only one of those impressed me. There were times when the phone lagged, rather than zoomed. Not sure why. The camera is great-to a point. As long as you don’t need true macro capability, it’s impressive. Clear images and great color.Overall, it‘s the best attempt at replacing my iPhone. I’ll leave you hanging with whether or not it actually did. But that doesn’t really matter. Ultimately, you have to try it for yourself.","September 2, 2024"
"SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Flip 6 AI Cell Phone, 512GB Unlocked Android Smartphone, FlexCam, Photo Assist, Camcorder Mode, Live Interpreter, Foldable Design, 2024, US 1 Yr Manufacturer Warranty, Silver Shadow",JDL Reviews,5.0,"Just as a little background, I moved from a Galaxy S22 Ultra to this phone.  As to size, this phone appears to be a tiny bit longer when opened and a tiny bit thinner since the 22 Ultra has curved edges on the side.  I liked the stylus/pen in the Ultra, but I did not use it enough to really matter in the switch.  One of the main reasons I decided to switch is the size of this phone when folded.  Some manufacturers have started making pockets bigger, but many have not and I would often find the edge of my phone sticking out of my pocket. This is an invitation for hitting it on something.  This phone folds up easily and fits in any pocket without that worry.  Samsung installs a screen protector on the main/large screen from the factory which I thought was a nice bonus, but you will want to get a protector for the outer screen since it is touched all the time even when  the phone is opened to full size.  As far as specs go, this phone has the same basic features as the S22 Ultra; wireless charging, great cameras, good processing speeds, and good memory (unless you use your phone as a video camera or take tons of pictures everyday).  The sound quality from the speakers is a bit better than the 22 Ultra IMO.  I have had no problems with Wi-Fi or BT connections.  We have 5G AT&T signal in this area, and there have been zero problems with that.  The call quality is great; just as the Ultra.  So far I am really impressed with this ""little"" phone.  A couple of things to note: 1.  If you are moving from another Samsung, be sure to use the SmartSwitch app.  It moves everything over.  You may have to sign into some accounts again since it is a different device, but the accounts/apps are moved.  I use Microsoft Launcher for easier access to MS apps (outlook, word, and Excel) and easier custom display settings instead of the standard Samsung UI so I cannot speak to any differences there, but can say the MS Launcher has worked flawlessly so far.  2. This is an unlocked phone so you can use it on any carrier that uses a SIM.  If your carrier will not activate the phone, that is on the carrier, not the phone since it WILL work.  NO it does not come with a SIM, those are supplied by your service provider as they are network specific.  Yes there is a SIM tray to move it over.  I was half drunk when I switched it over and only had to reposition the card twice to get it to slide back in (those tiny rascals are hard to get just right).  After that SmartSwitch took everything over when launched and it was smooth sailing from there.  3. Wireless charging and Super Fast charging have both worked as expected on all of our ""old"" chargers.  4.  The ""Always On Display"" does drain the battery since the screen is always on, but it is not a big drain.  Very similar if not the same as the Ultra.  Come on man, even if it were as high as 1%/hr, that would be 100 hours from full charge.  I can go 2 days of full usage (calls/data/cam/etc) without recharging and possibly more.  I just don't like my phone to get below 40% so I charge it back up.  There are many features I have not tried yet that were not available on the 22 Ultra, but I will get to them and update the review as necessary.  This is just an early review so it may be updated even without trying other ""new"" features.  At first I was not sure about switching, but am not glad I did.  If you are moving from an Ultra/Note and are used to having the pen and used it a lot, this may not be for you.  If that is the case, you should look at the Galaxy Fold.  The main reason I did not go with the Fold is that the phone size/pocket fit would have been the same as the Ultra.  So far I have not looked back once and am glad I made the switch.","August 4, 2024"
"SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Flip 6 AI Cell Phone, 512GB Unlocked Android Smartphone, FlexCam, Photo Assist, Camcorder Mode, Live Interpreter, Foldable Design, 2024, US 1 Yr Manufacturer Warranty, Silver Shadow","""Jocko""",5.0,"Samsung flip 6 is really a great phone! I got the mint green color phone and it's a cool color but I did put a case on it. I wasn't sure how I would feel about the flip feature but I actually really like it and how it is so much easier to fit in my pocket. I added a picture that compares it to my old samsung s9 plus and they are essentially the same size. I can feel a slight crease in the middle of the phone and in certain light I can see it, but truthfully, I don't even really notice it anymore and it's not a big deal to me the phone performs so well it is a non issue. I do need to use both hands to flip the phone open or to grip the top with my right hand, so it's not like it's just going to flop open on you. The battery lasts me all day with some pretty heavy use, playing games and using social media. It's does take a little while to charge but I'm not sure if that's the phone or the cord I'm using. It can be charged wireless as well. The camera is awesome and takes amazing pictures, and even the front camera when the phone is closed is awesome. I haven't extensively tried it yet but the translate feature is pretty cool. I could see how it could be helpful traveling. All in all I really like this phone and think it is a great buy. The only super slight almost miniscule thing that I wish but you can't use with this phone is an S pen, but I can live without my pen for a phone that can so easily do so much more and fold and fit in my pocket.","August 4, 2024"

It's superior to my Pixel 8 pro. I also like that the smaller lens window makes it less likely to fingerprint. The photo of the goats in action is with the main camera.The glass on the front makes me worry about breakage but I love the selfie features it allows and when I tried it for translation I was surprised how well it worked with Japanese. I also love that you can use it to check notifications without opening the phone.This has a nice small profile and is comfortable to carry because of the smaller size when folded. It's sleek and looks nice. I don't love that the screen shows a groove but it's not really noticable except when taking photos in certain lighting. It also runs hotter than I expected, though that doesn't seen to slow it down.I am thinking to get a wallet or bag for it since there aren't cases that protect the back of the hinge from drops and I have issues with grip. Aside from that it feels pretty durable and I read good things about how the screen holds up on previous models.I'm less thrilled with the built-in AI features, but that's a personal thing.

"SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Flip 6 AI Cell Phone, 512GB Unlocked Android Smartphone, FlexCam, Photo Assist, Camcorder Mode, Live Interpreter, Foldable Design, 2024, US 1 Yr Manufacturer Warranty, Silver Shadow",[Redacted] c,5.0,"I absolutely love this Galaxy Z Flip6 phone in the gorgeous mint color! It fits in many of my pockets when folded without sacrificing screen size when it’s open! In fact, the screen is longer! So far I haven’t had an issue with a visual line where it folds. I wanted to use it for days after it came but was worried about how I would get the data from my older iOS iPhone transferred onto the Android Flip6. I had some issues years ago with transferring from other phones. With the 256GB Flip6 it turned out that the stress and delay was all unnecessary!When I started the transfer it was SO easy!!! Setup explained and took me through every step clearly. There was even an option to select transferring from an iOS iPhone to the Android Flip6. The only glitch was that I needed a certain cable to connect the two phones if I didn’t want to do it wirelessly. The Flip6 even told me which cable to use and it waited without having to start over while I did a frantic search, during which I discovered that I actually had the one needed with lightening on one end and USB C on the other. For those who have older iPhones that use lightening cables just be sure you have one with a USB C connector on the other end if you don’t want to transfer your personal data wirelessly. Wirelessly was an option.Also, the Flip6 needs to be fully charged before first use and it comes with a USB C to USB C cable but doesn’t come with an adapter. My iMac desktop has a USB C port and that charged it fine. I didn’t know if my adapters like the one for my iPad Pro could be used and if they would be too powerful to safely charge the Flip6. Haha, silly me. Samsung has super charger adapters available compatible with the Galaxy Z Flip6 much more powerful than any I have on hand. I have since ordered a couple USB C super charger adapters compatible with this phone on Amazon for faster, more portable charging than what I currently have.My first experiment with the Flip6 was taking photos, and to my surprise when I told my husband  “Smile” it took his photo without my even pressing the touch activated camera button! There was a countdown in seconds before it took his photo on its own. The quality and detail of the photo was remarkable. Our living room lighting was dim but the photo was clear and detailed. I had a lot of fun after that saying “Smile” and taking more photos, including of myself.For the selfie photo experiment I was, as with my previous cell phones, not thrilled at how I looked. I saw a different face than the one in the bathroom mirror and wondered which was the real me since cameras don’t lie, or do they? My husband peeked over my shoulder and told me I didn’t really look like that and suggested I hold the phone further away. It helped a little but it wasn’t until I took a photo of myself in the mirror with the rear camera that he said that it looked like me. It seems to be a distance thing. One other way to take a selfie that is cool with this phone is in the folded position. In that position the Flip6 can be set on a surface and the rear double lens camera can be used. I can stand further back than my arm’s length, say “Smile” and it takes my picture. I take lots of pictures for portrait and nature paintings and this phone’s photo quality is overall quite an upgrade, especially the double lens.Another surprising new thing that happened during first use was that the phone repeated in a female voice what I loudly told my dogs when they were barking! I still don’t know what I did to activate that function, but it will be interesting and exciting to try all the new functions and AI capabilities.When I  transferred my current cell service including my phone number to the Flip6, it was again SO easy! As directed by the carrier, I downloaded their app from the Google Play app store and with the IMEI 1 number in Settings I didn’t even need a SIM card. There was no extra transfer fee to keep my phone number like there was in past transfers. It helped to write down the long IMEI 1 number so I didn’t have to go back and forth from Settings to the carrier app during the process since it is too long to remember. For some reason I was unable to copy and paste it. I don’t know why, maybe it was just the way I did it. The set up took a little while but was relatively fast. Shortly after completion I received a call and a text from a friend without a glitch on the new phone! For anyone slightly intimidated by setting up a new phone like I am it is much faster and easier now than it used to be and the instructions on this phone make it pretty stress free.Added Note: after transferring my existing phone number from my iOS iPhone to the Android Flip6 I received phone calls and text messages on the Flip6. However, I later discovered that I was only able to receive texts from Android phones and not iPhones. I spent a lot of time researching this issue and it can happen after an existing number on an iPhone is transferred to an Android. There is a recommended fix on the Apple site in Support. From the Apple site, “If you switched to a non-Apple phone and aren't getting SMS/MMS messages, you might need to deregister iMessage”. Following the prompts in Apple Support, my phone number was deregistered from iMessage online and it only took a few minutes (this was done AFTER the transfer to the new Android phone). I am now getting text messages on the Flip6 from my friends and family who use iPhones. I hope this saves time and helps those who may have the same issue. It worked for me!","August 6, 2024"
"SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Flip 6 AI Cell Phone, 512GB Unlocked Android Smartphone, FlexCam, Photo Assist, Camcorder Mode, Live Interpreter, Foldable Design, 2024, US 1 Yr Manufacturer Warranty, Silver Shadow",F. Roman,4.0,"I purchased this to replace my Samsung Ultra S22 and have been using it for a little over a week now. I did attempt to trade in for a flip 5 at one point, but that camera was... bad, so I ended up keeping my Ultra. There are obviously many differences between the two, the camera being just the first. I'll go into some including - Overall feel, Camera, Screen, Fingerprint sensor, Charging and Battery Life, and OtherOverall feelIt feels quality. It doesn't feel like a phone that might shatter or snap in half when I inevitably drop it down the steps, but I'll report back when that happens. The hinge is solid. It is not the hinge of the old days where you can flip the phone open at a snap of the wrist. You will need a second hand. The phone stays in positions from lie flat all the way down to the smallest of degrees without closing or changing the angle.CameraThe Ultra's camera is better by miles, but that is something you probably know going in. The flip's camera is now very serviceable, and Samsung has some sort of wizardry that helps that along cleaning up your somewhat blurry zoomed in pictures for you. It feels like I don't need to carry around a second item for photos, and since every day is not a vacation, I'm good with that. If you are a selfie person, you can leave the phone closed using the outside screen to take your selfies getting the full power of the main lenses unlike other devices where you get the lessor selfie cam lens, making this camera better in at least that use case.ScreenScreen, yeah, you can see and feel where it folds. In my opinion, it isn't terrible, though. It's the price of having a foldable phone, and with the screen on at a normal viewing angle, that fold line isn't present for me. The screen feels nice, even over the bump, though you can tell it is not the same super durable S22 Ultra glass. Leave the preinstalled screen protector on.The screen is nearly the same length as the S22 Ultra, but it is narrower. With the phone open, the narrowness can make the phone a little tricky to hang on to if you are trying to one hand the phone and touch buttons at the bottom of the screen. I can't quite put my finger on it, but it does feel like somewhat of a balancing act compared to the heartier S22. The width of the screen has, I think, also played havoc with one of my weather apps sometimes not showing some information, but otherwise hasn't bothered me.The screen feels big enough, and is also not an endless display, so I welcomed back some bezels. Having bezels back has actually been kind of nice as the endless had a tendency to pick up errant touches on the sides.FingerprintThe flip fingerprint sensor is on the power button, and works very well... almost too well. It picks up my fingers even when I'm not trying to unlock my phone. There is a setting that will fix this so that the sensor only works when cover or main screen is on, but I like only having to touch the button to wake up the phone, so this is my tradeoff.Charging and Battery LifeIt isn't slow, but it is not Super fast like the S22. It guesses about 1:15 to go from 50%-100% where as the S22 would go from 0-100% in less than an hour using the same cable and brick. I am rarely away from a charger anymore, so it's fine, but I can see it being inconvenient for those times where I want a quick shot of juice. It won't give that same bang for the 5 minutes.The battery seems to last about the same amount of time as the S22. Basically a full day depending on my uses. If I'm playing games throughout the day (which I won't get into other than to say I haven't noticed any performance difference between this and the S22, which is a good thing), the battery drains more quickly and might not make it a full day, but that is to be expected, and was the case with my S22, and basically every other phone I've had as well. If you use it like a phone with a camera, you should be fine from wake to sleep.OtherGoogle assistant. I'm not sure if this is Samsung's fault or not, but if you tell Google to do something with the phone closed, the outside screen will tell you to open the phone to complete the command. This is absurd, and one of the main reasons, even with all the other nitpicks, that I can't give this 5*. Maybe this gets fixed in a future update (probably not, though, I imagine we are going on 5 years of this). If I need to pull my phone out and open it up, I'm probably doing whatever task I needed done all by my self. Bixby does work from the outside screen, though, so this is the first time I've ever had it enabled (though it is super limited in comparison).","July 30, 2024"

I'm using a Note 8, which for those counting is like 12 generations old at this point, and grandma is still kicking - and she's also WELL smaller than a great many of the more current models across a variety of brands. That means that you are very likely going to have a BIGGER size difference to contend with. If you need it to be smaller, this may be your phone. If you don't want to sacrifice screen size, this is most certainly NOT IT for you.I'm coming from a Note, and you will pry that pen from my cold, dead hands. For those who aren't familiar, I mean a pen that lives inside the phone and pops out when you push the end, not another device to keep up with separately. (Google the Note series if you need a visual here.) Yes, I see the logistical issues with the flip situation, and no, I don't care. If they can fold an entire touch screen they can fold a pencil.So my favorite thing about this phone so far is.... drumroll please... updated apps. My elderly phone is not getting updates anymore, so I'm therefore not on the newest version of a great many apps. I cannot tell a lie: NYT games is a big one. The interface is so much better on the newer app and that's 90% of what I use the new phone to do. Would this be true of pretty much any new phone? Yes. Take that as you will.The dip remains annoying but if I were otherwise a fan it would be no big deal. The touch interface is annoying me, but in all fairness that's probably because I'm switching back and forth and therefore the muscle memory is confused all the time.I'm playing with the camera, and the jury is still out in that regard. I like what I like, and what I like most of all is predictability. Anybody who takes a lot of photos or is a serious hobby will tell you the same thing, if they're self-aware enough to realize that this is a fundamental part of photography. If my camera doesn't act the same every single time, then every shot is to some extent a shot in the dark, and I'm not okay with that. The more things a camera does for you, the less predictable it is - generally speaking, I mean. If it always does the exact same things in the exact same ways, that's fine, but this thing is trying to be smart and that means it's like wrestling another living being that has its own Opinions and Goals (which may not align with my own) rather than using a tool over which I have complete control. All that said, though, the end results are GOOD when I'm not trying any funny stuff. Maybe once this being and I manage to learn each other's quirks, we'll be the best of friends. Maybe I'll hurl it off a bridge. Only time will tell. I know that doesn't help you make your decisions right this minute, but unless you're the sort who owns a DSLR and actually manually adjusts settings as a matter of course, I would suspect you'll be fine with this camera. It produces good output without having to fiddle with it.Until next time, y'all.Captain's Log: Day 1It's my plan to play around with the phone, use it, and come back with updates as I have more input. There's no way anybody can sit down and ""review"" a phone or computer or anything like that as far as I'm concerned. I mean, the techie sorts can do the techie things (not me, but my spouse is, so you'll get some of that eventually), but it's still only theoretical until you integrate a new device into your everyday life and usage patterns.Anyway. Day one (well 2 really since I got it yesterday). Barely out of the box. Comes with nothing but a charging cable. No brick. Anybody getting this phone has plenty of places to plug in and/or has a preference for bricks or multiports or whatever, so I'm fine with this. I mean I actually could use a freaking brick but only because I can't currently find any of the three dozen that are someplace in this house. We've got plenty of those Anker multiport situations, though. Oh - it comes with a quick start guide, but I've seen more instructions on the back of frozen french fries, so you'll need access to the Goog or whatever you use to answer your questions. I got my first smart phone many years ago and it came with a literal novel-sized book, so this would have to come with an encyclopedia set and 99% of it would be irrelevant to me anyway, so I'm also fine with this. There's a web site but we all know we're just going to google our questions and start pushing buttons to see what happens.This is narrower than I expected in the hand. I'm not mad about that. The screen interface is WILD. I mean the touch feel - it's different than the glass on my last phone. Jury is out on how I feel about it but preliminary indications are good. The lenses stick out a good bit, and that has me considering some of those little lens protectors.It charges up very quickly, though that will also be a function of your charging setup. I used my own cords and such. Mine are longer and nicer.It's been in use less than 24 hours and already there's a little dip in the screen where it folds. I already do not like this but I'm not sure there's any way around it if you're going to fold a literal screen in half, at least with currently available technology.There's a little guide that comes up automatically when you turn it on for the first time. Next update will address the setup process and probably the camera since I'll probably want to fiddle with that fairly immediately.","July 26, 2024"

Samsung GALAXY S6 G920 32GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Octa-Core Smartphone - Black Sapphire,Amazon Customer,4.0,"Popped my at&t sim card in and it worked fine. But for some reason it gets poor service. I've yet to see it reach full LTE, only regular 4G, which seems to be a common issue with unlocked smartphones. It could possibly be with the S6 in general tho, as my girlfriend has a nonunlocked S6 with Sprint and has the same issue. Despite that it works fast enough with cellular service, and really snappy with good WiFi.  The screen look absolutely phenomenal and the black sapphire color has gotten me many compliments. Not a big fan of Samsung and their bloated apps that can't really be uninstalled. Also if you value battery life this isn't your phone. Although I'm never very far from a charger so it hasn't been a big issue yet, plus when it charges it charges FAST.  Overall a great phone, and great value but be sure to check out some competitors before buying.","July 16, 2015"

I can understand it, but I'd rather prefer to navigate in Google Maps, for example, listening to my native language.And, yet, a lot of AT&T useless apps. It's not a completely unlocked phone. It's an AT&T phone unlocked only to allow SIM cards of other companies.All that made me try, for the first time, to root the mobile. And then I realized it's impossible to root this model - which is actually the G920A.

"SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 Cell Phone, Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone, 256GB, 8K Camera & Video, Brightest Display Screen, Long Battery Life, Fast 4nm Processor, US Version, Green",Samuel,4.0,"I got this S22 5G phone to replace my S20 5G that according to my new cell carrier, wasn't actually 5G (AT&T now, previous carrier Verizon). That was a huge disappointment as I loved my S20.So every carrier & store were practically giving these S22 phones away, and yes, I could've gotten a 'free' phone, but as my dad taught me, nothing in life is free. So I shelled out $700 instead and got one through Amazon. Ok, I actually shelled out $1,400 & got 2. Why? Because 'free' from my carrier meant upgrading to an unlimited plan which would cost me $100 more per month - indefinitely. No thank you. There's Wi-Fi almost everywhere.So, I actually did a lot of research before buying this. This S22 had good reviews as well as some mixed reviews which concerned me. My S20 was actually awesome - still is - I can't use it for calls, but I still use it for internet access when I'm home and my S22 is charging. That said, it's hard for me not to compare this S22 to my S20.For me, battery life is a big deal. I've noticed the battery in the S20 is good, but it's not amazing. Still, it'll last you most of the day. I have to keep a charging cable at my office just in case. Visually, it's a good phone. It's not as good as the S20 which even though it's an older model, has more pixels which makes everything look better. The S22 camera is OK, but again, the S20 is superior and that annoys me as my phone IS my camera and my upgraded phone SHOULD be better. Lastly - and this one is important - the speaker phone is not good at all. So there it is. If you just need a phone for calls, texts, & internet then this S22 is fine. If you take lots of pics & opt for speaker over Bluetooth then skip this one.I've compared my older Samsung phone to this one in each aspect so that if you have an older (but not ancient) phone, you'll think twice before upgrading. Plus, don't fall for the unlimited scam the carriers are pushing - you'll be better off buying your phone (unless you alreadyhave an unlimited plan - then upgrade for free). The new phones are just not as good as they should be. Gone are the days where you can buy a replacement battery, so don't leave your phone charging overnight anymore!Hope this review helps you make a decision.","July 14, 2022"

I sent it in again and they couldn't fix or replace it.  They gave me a refund that was $300 less than the cost of the replacement.  It was cheaper to buy an S22 still at a higher price and it is actually not as good as the S21, the battery won't last 15 hours.  The only reason I bought the Samsung was because it was the only android phone supported by Cochlear and since it is an implant I can't very well switch to a different hearing aid.  BTW it took months to resolve this issue.11/12/2022 update.  The battery issue is even worse than I thought.  I have turned off all the ""features"" recommended to save battery usage and yesterday I got a low battery warning after 10 hours of just having the phone on, no calls, no media streaming, just some texts and some web use over my house WiFi.

"SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 Cell Phone, Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone, 256GB, 8K Camera & Video, Brightest Display Screen, Long Battery Life, Fast 4nm Processor, US Version, Green",DeusExKing,3.0,"I have had the Samsung Galaxy S5, S7 & S9 phones, and have loved them, so I knew I wanted to purchase another Galaxy class phone. I wanted the S21 but could NOT FIND a new (not refurbished) S21 anywhere. I CANNOT AFFORD even the base model S23, so that left me with the S22. I really like the phone and I Absolutely love that I could finally get one in my favorite emerald green. I am happy with my new S22 for the most part, but I am extremely disappointed and frankly, quiet angry at Samsung for their poorly thought out and greedy decisions to remove the Mico SD card slot option from the S21s, s22s, and S23 phones. The added memory storage was one of the former key features that I absolutely loved about the Samsung phones. As a transplant candidate, I HAVE TO STORE A LOT OF MEDICAL INFORMATION on my phone. By removing the Mico SD card option, they have SEVERELY CUT THE AMOUNT of information I can keep. Instead of putting their customers storage needs 1st, like any great company should, Samsung has become exceedingly greedy, and has denied that option to their customers. They decided Instead to force their customers to pay higher prices on higher gigabyte phones. Prices that people who live off of merger, low, or SSDI ONLY (like me), incomes, CAN'T AFFORD. This corporate greed & lack of concern for their customers needs has been the most hurtful part of having to replace my phone. I DID NOT have the funds to purchase a new phone but as a double lung transplant candidate, I HAD TO HAVE A PHONE. My life literally depends on it.. I need a MINIMUM OF 512GB (256 phone + 256 memory card). But I HAD TO SETTLE for only HALF that because I couldn't afford the 512gb S22 phone. Don't get me wrong, the Galaxy phones themselves are still excellent in their performance, speed, connectivity and function. They are easy to use, extremely well made and frankly still the only brand I prefer to own. But the removal of the added SD card slot, is a major slap in the face. I hope Samsung realizes this stupid blunder and redeems themselves by continuing to include it in ALL of their Galaxy S phones from here on out. If and when the S24 comes out, I pray it'll be included going forward.","April 16, 2023"

The spec sheets speaks to cost cutting measure to try to release a device while also upgrading some minor components from last years release.For the pros-Great form factor. Very easy to yield in one hand and much more comfortable to hold compared to an iPhone 13.-Nice vivid screen with variable refresh. Some ppl will not notice much a difference in day day use. The phone will feel faster and smoother when navigating through menus or webpages. Video content tends to run at 60 fps so you won't notice much for a difference in media consumption.-Lightweight. The combination of aluminum and glass made this device much easier to yield.-Great UI and customization. Samsung leads the way with being to change everything from fonts, icons, tile placements, themes. Very robust options and some are available for free via thier Samsung storeCons- Terrible battery. Most reddit posts and reviewers will tell you to disable or throttle services to get it to last all day. But why pay for features that you can readily get at a fraction pf the price or cheaper (Like a pixel 5a or a Zenphone 9).- Thermal throttling issues. May not he a big issue for you but extensive gaming will render the phone hot to the touch. It appears the passive cooling on the device has either been taken away or not implemented in a way to help mitigate heat away from the hands-Unoptimized OS/Hardware. Something about this release feels rushed. I experienced terrible standby time (phone died unused in my pocket at a wedding venue in 8 hours). Apps would generally freeze or force close.At its msrp, this phone is a hard pass. At 700, there are much better devices with better performance both in battery and software. If youre looking at this price range, consider a Pixel 5a (not the 6 as Tensor is still buggy), Zenphone 9, or even an Apple 13/ 13Mini","August 19, 2022"

I love the shape, the speakers, the display, oneUI and so many more things.But the battery just doesn't work for me. Maybe I got a faulty unit or it's actually that bad, but for a week straight I wasn't able to get over 3 hours of screen on time. I wouldn't say I'm a power user or anything and mostly use my phone for social media. But my 4 year old OnePlus 5T lasts longer than this phone. I turned off 120hz display and 5g thinking it might improve the battery but that didn't help either. This could be a user error but I was never able to get myself through the day on a single battery charge.All that said the standby battery is pretty good. If I don't use the phone for hours the battery doesn't drain at all but right as I pick it up I just see the percentage going down.I would 100% recommend this phone for anyone who's looking for a small phone and they don't care about how long their phone lasts and always have chargers near by.

"Samsung Galaxy S10+ Plus 128GB+8GB RAM SM-G975F/DS Dual Sim 6.4"" LTE Factory Unlocked Smartphone International Model, No Warranty (Prism Black)",TPA,5.0,"My Galaxy S9 developed a screen glitch (hardware related) so I looked for a replacement, otherwise I would still be using it. The S10+ was the last Samsung flagship to have both ear phone jack and memory expansion slot. I am not as concerned as some about having the latest software support; I can always root and upgrade manually if I so choose. I opted for NEW old stock and I suggest buying from DAC Enterprises as she currently has the best deals by far on these. The phone came unlocked with Android 12, One UI 4.1 and with Android security updates to mid 2022. AFAIK, there are security updates available online for this phone to mid 2023. The S10+ from DAC Enterprises came in a sealed OEM box with OEM charging block and cable, SIM eject tool and some paperwork. No buds. It also comes with a screen protector front and back installed from the Samsung factory. I also have a SuperShieldz glass protector, but I am hesitant to apply it because of the ultrasonic fingerprint sensor.The S10+ is much the same as the S10, but larger with bigger battery and a depth sensor for the front camera for bokeh effects. The S10+ is an evolutionally upgrade over the S9/S9+, however there are some things I prefer in the S9. For starters, the fingerprint sensor. Using the capacitive FP sensor on the S9 was so much easier and quicker than on my old S5 before it. I always use a case and with the case, it's incredibly quick and easy to reach the sensor with my index finger. If you don't use a case then your expreience will not be nearly as good with the S9. For the S10, Samsung ""upgraded"" the tech to an ultrasonic FP sensor. For people who don't use cases, this change might have worked out reasonably well. But for me, now I have to locate the FP sensor on the open glass without a guide. (as the case cutout had been before). Yes, if I tap the screen it will light up the FP area, but this is an extra step not required on the older models. Next, I find that I need to press harder on the sensor (compared to the S9) to get a reliable reading. I am still getting used to it. YMMV, but for how I use my phones the S10/S10+ is a minor downgrade in terms of FP sensor convenience. OTOH, some say the new tech may be harder to spoof and thus be more secure.The other minor change I don't like is the power button has been moved up much higher (why Samsung?) and is now too high. Also, moving up to the plus size has exacerbated this issue for me. In addition, the buttons have been made smaller. I ask again why? Now they are a little harder to locate/use quickly. This may not mean much to some, but for people who are power users (like me, fast and efficient) or to the opposite extreme, people with sight disabilities, they will likely be slowed down with the smaller harder to locate buttons. It's more or less minor, but worth noting.Most of the changes though have been true upgrades and these phones are still (in 2024) IMHO world class with high end screens, cameras and audio reproduction capabilities. Android 12 is only 2 years old, and with 8 Gb RAM, 128 GB storage, and expansion available, this phone should keep almost everyone going for quite some time. If you can get it for the right price, 2 thumbs up.","June 26, 2024"

"Samsung Galaxy S10+ Plus 128GB+8GB RAM SM-G975F/DS Dual Sim 6.4"" LTE Factory Unlocked Smartphone International Model, No Warranty (Prism Black)",tapout,3.0,"Ok comenzemos, compre el telefono s10 plus prisma green, 8 gb y 128 de almacenamiento versión internacional el  dia 2 de Octubre y lo devolvi el dia 5 de Octubre, la razon principal de la devolucion fue que al hacer el umboxin me encuentro con un cargador europeo si señor, y entonces!!! Ah para poder cargarlo debia comprar un adaptador??  porque debo yo incurrir en gastos adicionales si estoy comprando un elefono de casi 800$ el vendedor no coloca en ninguna parte de su descripcion que no viene con un cargador apto para los estados unidos. Otra cosa el telefono calienta de sobremanera al jugar, pero realmente calienta, no es que esta tibio no. Es caliente!! esto me llamo la atención mucho pero no pude hacerle otras pruebas ya que para mi lo primordial fue el cargador y revisen tambien no entendi porque la caja del telefono viene envuelta en un plastico sellado, los telefonos de alta gama y los que no, no traen esa envoltura plastica solo un sello transparente que hay que cortar para abrir la caja, este trajo aparte de esa envoltura plastica una etiqueta de color negro con unas especificaciones y recorde un video que vi de la comparativa de un telefono falso y uno verdadero y recorde esa etiqueta que la traia la caja del telefono falso, asi que si no le importa el asunto del cargador al comprarlo revisen bien esto que estoy diciendo aca, revisen muy bien los materiales del telefono que sea cristal la parte tarsera???, otro punto corri antutu en el teléfono y algo me llamo la atención en las especificaciones del teléfono arrojadas por antutu me decia que solo habian 2 camaras en la parte trasera?? esto me llamo la atencion y corri antutu en un galaxy a70 y alli si me dijo que habian 3 camaras, por todos estos detallitos y por la razon del cargador lo devolvi pero como dije antes no lo tube lo suficiente para poder garantizar que fuese falso o no, asi que si lo compran revisenlo por favor a fondo antes de que se les pase los 30 dias que les da amazon porque el teléfono no tiene garantia en los estados unidos y eso si lo especifica la descripción.Ok let's start, I bought the s10 plus prisma green, 8 gb and 128 international storage phone on October 2 and returned it on October 5, the main reason for the return was that when doing the umboxin I find a charger  European yes sir, and then !!!  Ah to be able to charge it, should I buy an adapter?  Because I must incur additional expenses if I am buying a telephone of almost $ 800 the seller does not place anywhere in his description that does not come with a charger suitable for the United States.  Another thing the phone heats up when playing, but it really heats, it's not that it's not warm.  It is hot!!  This caught my attention a lot but I could not do other tests since for me the main thing was the charger and check also I did not understand why the phone case is wrapped in a sealed plastic, high-end phones and those that do not, do not bring  that plastic wrap just a transparent seal that has to be cut to open the box, this brought apart from that plastic wrap a black label with specifications and I remembered a video I saw of the comparison of a fake phone and a real one and remember that  label that the fake phone box brought, so if you do not mind the issue of the charger when you buy it, check well what I am saying here, check very well the materials of the phone that is the late part glass ???, another point ran  Antutu on the phone and something caught my attention in the specifications of the phone thrown by Antutu told me that there were only 2 cameras in the back?  This caught my attention and I ran ahead in a galaxy a70 and there if he told me that there were 3 cameras, for all these details and for the reason of the charger I returned it but as I said before I did not tube it enough to guarantee that it was false or  No, so if you buy it, please check it thoroughly before it passes the 30 days that Amazon gives you because the phone has no guarantee in the United States and that if the description specifies it.","October 7, 2019"

Definitely recommend the upgrade if you are on an 8th generation or earlier.Box came with serial number stickers, charging block (European connection), USB-C cable, USB-C to USB-A adapter, AKG headphones, a clear case, and paperwork. I did not put on the case on or use it at all, but I would say that it would only be good for small bumps and scratches, definitely not drops.I have purchased two cases, the Spigen Rugged Armor (thin protective case) and an Encased belt clip designed for that case (which is a nice combination). The second case I purchased is the Otterbox Defender, which I haven't received or used yet, but I'm looking forward to using it based on the reviews of others on YouTube.Incase you are wondering, it is the real thing, came to me brand new in the plastic wrap, with the Samsung manufacturer's seal unbroken.","April 20, 2019"

This is hands down, the best phone I've ever had. This is a little strange of Samsung because they are dabbling with technology in this phone that really hasn't been used ever so there are some kinks. For instance, the fingerprint reader is not the best in the world, they honestly would have been better off with an optical in-screen scanner like the ones on the oneplus 6T in my opinion. The facial recognition isnt the greatest but it's very decent. I understand they had to sacrifice hefty more accurate components for more screen real estate and that is honestly a sacrifice I'm willing to make. This phone is the fastest peace of technology I've ever seen, its ridiculous. Snap 855 and 8gb of ram, you cant beat it!

Toting 5 lenses you'd think it would be amazing, but it's a big let down, at least to me. The options are many but the image quality is subpar; don't know what's going on with the image processing, but my nexus 6p of 3 + years ago still takes much better pictures.

"Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G, 128GB, Cloud Mint - Single SIM - Unlocked (Renewed)",Briana Arenz,5.0,"I took photos of the phone the day of arrival but now cant find them.. but the phone came in EXCELLENT condition although the packaging was just a box with little to ensure a safe delivery. The phone was unlocked but a **NETWORK UNLOCK CODE** kept popping up when sim card was insterted. (Thats the photo in this review.) So I swore the phone wasnt unlocked. Reached out to the seller and my carrier which was walmart family mobile. I was told by my carrier i needed a new sim card. So i ordered it and when it finally arrived,  boom same error. My carrier reset the sim many times and still no luck. When i had messaged the seller they gave me a code that wasnt right and when i reached out again, still another wrong code. What the phone fails to warn you is that only after a few attempts it will lock you out completely. It will then say **MASTER KEY CODE** needed. I googled what that was and it seemed like a hopeless code to obtain. The startup on the phone says AT & T. So i took it to their store and they had said that yes the phone was unlocked!! But the network was locked to walmart family mobilewhich was my carrier . So come to find out the code i needed, the first code, the network unlock code, I needed from my carrier!  They absolutely missed it and after days of this mess and ongoing phone calls, finally the walmart family mobile agent on that day in the At&T store had told me the codes i needed from day one. Idk how they just skipped the option and blamed my sim card. The codes arent a secret and im still unsure why they didnt recommend theirs to fix it. I guess they just assumed it wasnt their codes needed. But it was!!! Unbelievable right!! So then were now stuck on master key code and no one, my carrier, nor AT&T, nor samsung can help with that. Due to the sellers wrong codes, me googling the wrong codes, and most of all my carriers support line not mentioning their codes, I was locked out and was gonna return the phone. However AT&T did show me other sim cards put into the phone by other carriers were working. It was still unlocked but just couldnt now be used on family mobile and possibly all tracphone carriers due to the master key code lock. So with that said I swapped to AT&T prepaid and got their sim card and it all worked great! It was recommended to get the sim card from the AT&T store directly because sometimes those sim kits at walmart dont always work correctly and are nonrefundable. So if this issue happens to you just be sure to ask your carrier for those network codes!! The seller now knows what to suggest if this happens to another and I'm telling you that the carrier has the codes and all will be fine. Also the seller offered me a replacement phone  and partial refund for this issue. I declined a replacement only because I couldnt send this phone back and await a new one. I was already without a phone long enough dealing with this for days. So the seller at least still gave me a partial refund and that was okay with me. So the customer service is well and fair from them!!! Also even AT&T said the phone itself was in such great shape! So far so good on the phone itself, everything is working as it should.","July 6, 2023"
"Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G, 128GB, Cloud Mint - Single SIM - Unlocked (Renewed)",Honest_Critic,5.0,"After nearly four years with my Samsung A10e, I decided it was time for an upgrade. My criteria were specific: I wanted a more recent, used Samsung phone that was unlocked, had ample storage, and most importantly, featured a microSD slot for my extensive music library. The Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G in Cloud Red ticked all these boxes and more.Transitioning from the A10e, the performance leap to the S20 FE was immediately noticeable. Everything from navigating the UI to streaming content on YouTube and multitasking feels incredibly responsive. This phone has transformed my user experience, offering a significant improvement in speed and efficiency.Despite being a renewed device, the quality of the S20 FE pleasantly surprised me. It arrived with minor marks on the sides, but these were hardly a concern given the excellent condition of the screen and the overall functionality of the phone. I've always been particular about battery health, so I appreciated the ""Protect Battery"" feature, which I also used on my A10e. The battery performance has been exceptional, supporting my heavy music streaming habits without a hitch.The larger display is a game-changer. The vibrant colors and increased screen real estate enhance everything from watching videos to browsing the web. I've disabled certain features to extend battery life, but this hasn't detracted from my overall experience with the phone.One of the reasons I opted for an unlocked phone was the flexibility it offers. While I primarily use the S20 FE for media consumption, it's reassuring to know it can serve as a reliable backup for calls and texts if needed. The phone's build quality and care in its refurbishment are evident, making it a solid investment for anyone in the market for a high-quality, used smartphone.In summary, the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G has exceeded my expectations. It offers a perfect blend of performance, quality, and value, making it an excellent choice for Samsung enthusiasts and anyone looking for a premium smartphone experience without the flagship price tag.","February 17, 2024"

"Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G, 128GB, Cloud Mint - Single SIM - Unlocked (Renewed)",Briana Arenz,5.0,"I got purchased one in ""excellent"" condition. I was nervous, as I had never bought a used phone before and did not know what to expect. Physical inspection was fine. It turned on fine. In the box were the usual accessories, charging cord and wall adapter. I removed all the useless apps that phones come with, and stopped all the useless processes. Even so, the first few weeks were rough, as the battery would drain every day. At night, with 0 use, it would drain 20-30% in 8 hours. But then it seemed to equal itself out, and battery is great. It only drains by 1% at night now. I'm not sure what was going on with that. I read the specs before I received it, and it works as expected for me. No usability issues at all. Android Auto works perfectly with this, as opposed to continually disconnecting with my old phone. This charges very fast as well.","August 1, 2024"
"Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G, 128GB, Cloud Mint - Single SIM - Unlocked (Renewed)",Auricom,3.0,"When you buy something that has been renewed or refurbished, you do so with the understanding that the product was returned due to defects, but is being resold at a cheaper cost because those defects were corrected. Right?That was my rational when I bought this phone in November of 2023, replacing a cheap $70 dollar junk phone offered to me at a discount by my cellular provider. I mean, my friend bought a renewed phone off Amazon and has been very satisfied with it. Mine began giving me issues roughly a month into ownership.One of the ""handy"" little security features with this phone is a moisture/debris detector located in or around the charging port. After about a month of owning and using the phone, I was unable to actively charge my phone. The device would give me a warning saying to unplug the device immediately to prevent damage being done to the circuitry. It will not charge the battery so long as the port remains in a ""compromised"" state. You cannot turn off the sensor in the settings. I've tried clearing the port of this supposed dust and debris to no effect. I've taken it to rooms where we have dehumidifiers, and it still gives me this warning when i try to charge.The only option left to me was to buy a wireless charging pad, which can cost you up to $100 bucks. I was lucky to have a friend who had one to spare. It's the only way I can recharge the phone without taking it to a repair shop to test/replace the charging port. Most places I've seen online list replacing the port costs $99 dollars for part and labor, but there's no guarantee my local repair shops will abide by that.I've bought other products from Amazon's ""Renew Store"" that have been listed as renewed and have not given me issues, such as my bluetooth headset. But for whatever reason, this phone's issues slipped through their quality control. For that, I'm rather disappointed. I'm also very disappointed that Samsung would build ransomware into their phone and list it as a security feature.More importantly, I am disappointed in myself for simply accepting the phone as it is and using the wireless charger my friend gave me rather than send the phone back and demand a phone that was actually fixed. I will likely end up paying the extra $100+ bucks to have someone else repair the charging port.Knowing what I do now, would I buy with Amazon Renew Store again? Maybe. Between me and my friend, we've bought 3 products, with 2/3 being a worth while purchase. Those aren't terrible odds, and honestly, I could have probably fixed the situation myself if had brought it up to the seller. I may not have bought the same phone though, if I had to do it over. Samsung knew what it was doing when it added this feature to the phone, especially given they sell you the work-around for an extra $100-200 bucks. Slimey wretches.","March 5, 2024"

"Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G, 128GB, Cloud Mint - Single SIM - Unlocked (Renewed)",C. Reyloc,5.0,"I'd say that this Samsung S20 FE 5G has got to be one of the best smartphones that takes excellent photos that I have ever had in my life.....so far! It has wireless charging on it (something I did not know about), excellent camera set up that takes pretty good photos for the most part, excellent videos, has 128 GB of internal storage....however...there is NO slot for a microSD card for additional storage (a minor drawback]. Fingerprint reader is directly on the screen and it was hard to get used to that at first, but did not take long to get used to it and it works very good. Games seems to play rather well on this smartphone, tho I probably would not do very intensive gaming on this phone. Basic games works mighty well on this smartphone though. Really I think the only issues I have with this smartphone from Samsung are 2 things.....lack of extra storage and the camera will turn itself off if you go wide-angle when taking photos or videos. It seems to be a common issue/problem with Samsung S20 FE 5G smartphones. There are videos on You Tube on this issue and how to fix it....which is overall an easy fix. That issue does not happen until you hit a certain Samsung or Android update on this phone. Overall, a great smartphone and it's water resistant also....not sure about it being waterproof....so don't put it in water at all. I would rate this Samsung smartphone a pretty decent 5 of 5....despite those 2 minor issues with the Camera turning off frequently and the lack of extra storage space.","December 22, 2023"

It's an upgrade for me from the s8 and it's faster, slightly larger and better camera/video quality.I do have one problem, though. It must've been originally designed for verizon because I get a push notification every 10 minutes saying my sim card is not a verizon sim card. I know this is a common problem because I've seen it in other comments but I haven't been able to figure out a workaround that actually works. Maybe the seller could post instructions on their description somewhere?","August 10, 2024"

"Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G, 128GB, Cloud Mint - Single SIM - Unlocked (Renewed)",StormTrackerJay2,4.0,"This was my first experience buying a used phone. I was very hesitant, but am mostly pleased overall.The included cable (no brick included) does NOT charge my phone. They included a very cheap-o charging cable & this phone is PICKY! Actually I found ALL Samsung phones that we have/ have tried are... they only accept a USB C cable with a thicker wall to the plug in part. Any of the cheapo cables will NOT work.On the plus side, I was able to determine that this phone came with 92% battery life by using the ACU battery app...which was a huge concern for me buying a used phone. That was a happy relief!The camera is pretty nice! I tried & returned a brand new A23 before buying this used phone, and that camera was absolutely horrible.. worse than my very first LG cell phone that I got 8 years ago... yes, WORSE than that!After seeing what a piece of junk the A23 was & after talking to someone at the T-Mobile store, they told me that the A series phones are very bottom of the barrel and poor quality. I came to the realization that in order to get a phone that was decent, I was going to have to buy a used phone. I opted for the S20 FE instead of the S21, because the s20 is able to be expanded with a microSD card & the S21 can't be.I am not about to put all my stuff on some cloud or pay for extra storage. I opted out of an iPhone for that very reason. If Samsung doesn't allow for storage cards to expand their phones'  memories in the future, I will buy a different brand that does. After reading several reviews, I know there are others who feel the same way. I sure hope Samsung listens & doesn't go the disappointing route Apple does with their phones & lack of storage expansion.Overall, I'm happy with my used phone & the seller, minus the fact that they didn't even check to see if the charging cable worked that they sent with the phone. It did not & I had to buy new ones just for this phone.I WOULD purchase the phone again, although I'm not super fond of such a finicky phone in regards to the charging cable. I know it's a Samsung thing because my hubby's old S8 is the same as was the A23 I tried & returned. I don't like feeling like I have to carry a spare charging cable with me everywhere in the event that my main charging cable doesn't work with my phone for some reason. I never had that issue with my other brand USB C charged phones. Samsung phones seem to only work with cables that have a thicker wall to the C part of the charging cable. If LG was still making phones, I would have purchased one of those instead. We've tried TCL & Motorola...& Apple is a hard pass, so that left me with Samsung.","July 4, 2023"

"Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G, 128GB, Cloud Mint - Single SIM - Unlocked (Renewed)",Paula Neilands,4.0,"I received this S20 FE Renewed from Stalion Requip, Shipped from Amazon. Arrived with Android 13 installed. Phone was well packed and came in a plain box with a nice 5Volt 2Amp (9Volt 1.87Amp) charger, USB C charging cable, and SIM Tray removal tool. The box was labeled NEW. It is NEW, Pristine, Looks and Performs Flawlessly with one major exception. The S20 FE is a 'dumbed down' (cheaper) version of the S20 series. My Cell service is Tracfone through Verizon. I later found out the S20 FE does not support the mmWave bands needed for the fastest 5G Verizon service, nor does it reliably connect to Verizon in my weak signal home location. As a result I couldn’t get connected unless I walked outside my house into my driveway. Other Samsung and Apple phones connect to my Tracfone/Verizon service just fine inside my home. I even tried putting my SIM card in each of those other phones and they all connected just fine. Their SIM cards in the S20 FE had the same bad result. Someone living in a strong signal area would not notice unless they travel into a weak signal area. This seems to be a problem with the design of the S20 FE and not the fault of the Renewer or Amazon. I wasn't willing to wait and try a replacement S20 FE 5G, so unfortunately I had to send the S20 FE 5G back. I ended up ordering the S20+ from Stalion Requip and Shipped by Amazon, The S20+ supports most of the LTE bands and 5G bands (including mmWave bands) used by Verizon in my weak signal area. The S20+ connects properly to Tracfone/Verizon anywhere inside my home. This is important especially if you live or travel in a weak signal area with Verizon or other CDMA carrier. I don’t know about GSM carriers.I can’t say enough good about Stalion Requip. All Renewers are not created equal. Stalion Requip includes a printout of all the internal specs and test results. Purchase your phone from Stalion Requip and you won’t be disappointed with their work.","January 7, 2024"

"Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G, 128GB, Cloud Mint - Single SIM - Unlocked (Renewed)",Sherlanda,5.0,"I started getting notices from Sprint/TMobile that I needed to upgrade my phone to a 5G compatible phone by the end of the year. I went to the store and even though I had not upgraded my phone in 4 years there was no offers/discounts ( days of subsidizing phones really are dead but dang ). There was absolutely zero offers. Even the basic Samsung A32 was no longer offered as a free phone.I am not cheap but I am simply not willing to pay $800+ for a phone that will be outclassed in a few months.Started looking on Amazon for refurbished phone and the seller Last Of The Loot had the S20 FE for $400. Having read reviews from other buyers I knew was still rolling the die with complaints about scuff marks ( Not from that seller in particular but from refurb phone in general. I can accept cosmetic stuff since a refurb just means it functions to spec and blemishes to the case are something you can expect ), the phone being reported as stolen, the previous owner still owned money so it could not be unlocked, cracked screens, etc.I got this phone and when I opened the box it looked like it had never been used. Screen and case were pristine. It came with the owner's manual and a 15W charger. I know some people complain about that but this phone charges pretty fast and has pretty good power management so unless you are watching 4K videos all day or treating it as a portable game console the charge rate is really good IMHO. I don't have a wireless charger but am looking into it now.Phone is quite responsive in all aspects and the screen is simply gorgeous to watch videos on. Sound on the two speakers ( one at the top facing towards you and another at the bottom facing down ) is simply phenomenal. I had an HTC One when back in the day and I thought that sounded good. The difference in sound quality, volume and range of frequencies you can hear in the highs, mids and lows is like comparing $20 radio to surround sound.I have not delved into all the options in detail but I love the face unlock and fingerprint unlock options to secure your phone. Can't say too much about the camera yet since I have never been much of a picture taker but what I have seen so far it will definitely satisfy the average joe.Have used this phone as my daily driver for about 2 months now and have no had any issues whatsoever. I know that if you read some reviews and compare it to the S21 to upcoming S22 or S21 FE it will be another huge jump in performance and features but this looks like it will keep me chugging along for the next several years. If you want a newer phone but are on a budget or like me, you just find $1000+ for a phone to be ludicrous, this is good combination of price and performance.","December 29, 2021"

I mean don't get me wrong, I got rid of some apps I don't use, changed some settings to save battery life etc. My battery lasts the whole day now with regular use.

This phone doesn't come with an audio jack so we had to get some adapters that plug into the power spot so we can stream music through the phone in the car which was an easy fix.

I take a ton of pics and videos (the quality of both is really great) and haven't had an issue with storage space yet which is super awesome - I do back up all my images/video to google photos though just in case, I've lost way too much media over the years to keep it only on my phone. When taking a screenshot, there is a nice pop-up option that allows you to crop it or make edits right away, I use this function regularly and really appreciate having the option.I use it for work functions as well and can easily switch between multiple email accounts and google drive folders - downloading and opening documents is a breeze and its enhanced my ability to work remotely and on the go.As a public figure, I installed google voice so I can have a more personal and more public number and the phone handles both with ease.

Somehow this phone picked up a chip in the edge of the screen, before I applied the screen protector.  When I was cleaning the screen for the screen protector,  I discovered that the phones screen wasn't chipped, it was a screen protector that was already applied !

"Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G, 128GB, Cloud Mint - Single SIM - Unlocked (Renewed)",Anzenetta Marshall,4.0,"Got the phone, transferred the Sim and SD card from s9+ turned on and worked without any problems. Used Samsung Smart Switch and Google play to transfer apps and files from old phone to the new phone. Had to re-setup all the MFAs I use for work, but was expecting that. Love the in screen fingerprint scanner. Much easier to use then the back scanner I used on the S9+. It will miss from time to time, but especially at work where I have to do MFA authorizations many times throughout the day when connecting to user's computers and servers to check settings or perform remote fixes it is so much easier to press my thumb to the front of the screen than having to pull off the wireless charger to scan from the back. Battery life is great. Old S9+ could barely make it through a normal 8 hour shift and sometimes it wouldn't. The S20 FE makes it through a 12 hour extended shift with more than normal MFA with 27% battery still left. Can't really speak to the camera as if I am wanting to take good pictures I will pull out the Canon Rebel. For quick snaps of serial numbers, model numbers and things like that it works fine. Hands free is much clearer than on the S9+ as I don't get crackling or distortions on the S20 FE. A good phone for a refurbished one.","October 13, 2022"

"Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G, 128GB, Cloud Mint - Single SIM - Unlocked (Renewed)",Claudine,5.0,"This is an update to my comments from January 15th on the seller's (bayshine trading) comments section.Now that I have been using the phone for about a month I can say that the seller went BEYOND his responsibilities in his description of the phone, the packaging he provided, his ship speed, and the inclusions of all of the stated peripherals. As I said in my initial post, his answers to my my presale questions were accurate, honest and quickly responded. When the opportunity to recommend bayshine trading I will happily do so and will no doubt being doing business with them in the future.As for the phone, it is all I expected. Great refresh specs make for an ultra smooth experience. The screen quality is a nice step up from my MOTO Edge however I did adjust the white balance and RGB settings from the default settings a tad to suit my taste. TMO's 5G network plays well with the S20 FE. I routinely experience 120 mb download speeds inside my house. In full disclosure I got about the same performance from my Edge (NOT the Edge plus) which tells me that even though I traded up a bit regarding the Snapdragon processor, that upgrade hasn't seem to have had an affect on my download speeds. As a side note, I believe the MOTO Edge is an excellent phone and proved to be a great value as long as you're not paying list for the unit. (I paid $499 and list WAS $699) I did tire of the edge-to-edge display but that is a personal taste. Also, I didn't have any of the well documented screen problems that many of the units have had.Still, the S20 FE is an upgrade to the Edge in several areas: processor, display, refresh and form factor (again, a personal taste). My Edge had more native memory (256 gb vs 128 gb) but both can close (or increase) that gap with an sd card. The Edge was nearly a pure Android experience and the S20 FE comes loaded with mucho Samsung apps and bloats. I kept some, deleted some, ignored some but this common complaint about Samsung is true - all with workable work-arounds but true.So, inconclusion if you have a $500 cell phone budget and don't mind buying a year-old model, it's hard to go wrong with this reconditioned option. Coupling the phone with a resell vendor like bayshore trading only sweetens the deal.Buy with confidence.","February 7, 2021"

"SAMSUNG Galaxy S21+ Plus 5G Factory Unlocked Android Cell Phone 128GB US Version Smartphone Pro-Grade Camera 8K Video 12MP High Res, Phantom Black",K.L.,5.0,"Pros:Industry-leading processing power and firmware.Long firmware support life.Excellent battery life.Super nice display.Charges fast.Great speakers.Great glass used for the display and back.Should be more resistant to damage, in comparison to other Samsung phones (re: s20 FE) which use the brittle Gorilla Glass 3. And even if you break it, Samsung is the Honda of phones. Parts are always cheap, readily available, and as such repairs are cheaper and easier to access.Looks good while doing all of the above.Cons:The fingerprint reader is abysmal. I'm coming from a Razer Phone 2 which read and recognized my fingerprints near instantaneously, and very reliably. Sometimes this thing just refuses to recognize my prints, or takes a good second or so to do anything about it.This camera is years behind what it was hyped up to be. On my RP2 I was running a Gcam mod and generally getting better results, ESPECIALLY in night mode. I was kind of gutted when I discovered how inferior this camera array is. Lots of noise on the wide angle, tons of focus hunting regardless of which lens you're using, just generally primitive by today's standards. Is it a hardware issue or a software issue? No idea, but it's unacceptable either way. Do NOT buy this phone for the cameras. Many cameras from a few years ago are better, especially with Gcam.The display, while beautiful, has pretty terrible viewing angles. Yet another problem I thought we left back in 2015.RAM is silly low, even by flagship standards from 2-3 years ago.Meh:Samsung is still lagging behind stock android in many ways. There are a lot of redundant and pointless apps/""features"" that are clearly just Samsung trying to trick you into giving THEM your data, rather than Google; and doing it poorly. Customization is somehow better and worse than ROMs which are closer to stock. Sammy put a few decent features in here for customizing, but not really anything you couldn't have gotten from a 3rd party. The launcher is terrible and restricting, but easy to replace. I personally use Microsoft Launcher with a bunch of 3rd party widgets, icon packs, etc.Conclusion:At the end of the day, this is a matter of price. When this phone was released for around $1k, it was insanely overpriced and not at all worth it. However, I snagged it on Prime Day for $699. At that price, I feel like it BARELY scapes past acceptable. $100 more than that and I would have returned it and waited to see what comes out later this year from other mfgs. The s21 line is bizarre to me. It blends top of the line features and tech with relatively archaic features and tech. I would not call this a flagship series, except in that Samsung does not have a higher-tiered line. This could have been much more polished, and it's sad they cut corners and had some critical oversights. But again, if you can get this for almost half of what it cost at launch retail, it's worth it. Don't expect bleeding edge performance across the board, and you should be satisfied.","July 13, 2021"
"SAMSUNG Galaxy S21+ Plus 5G Factory Unlocked Android Cell Phone 128GB US Version Smartphone Pro-Grade Camera 8K Video 12MP High Res, Phantom Black",NikNotABot,5.0,"I came from the Samsung A70 (a $400 phone), and coming up to a flagship is a MASSIVE difference. I liked the camera on my old phone, it was fine, but on the s21+, it is phenomenal! Just the camera upgrade is great, but the 120 refresh rate is great too. I've heard YouTubers talk about the refresh rate pretty often, so I had high expectations for it. And I got to say, the experience is very real. After about a month of using this phone, I set my screen to 60hz, to see how long I could last with the old refresh rate. The difference was immodestly. In less than an hour, I had to switch back to 120hz. The Battery life on this phone is great too. I'm not a heavy user. Normally, I'm on youtube, texting friends, check emails, etc, and the battery is more than enough for it.

I bough an S7 on Prime days 3 year ago and it was much much better deal.  Would hope to see better Prime Day deal with Samsung phones in the futureWith the shipping to Canada.  It took a bit of time, would hope to see a quicker turnaround.  Also, with my order, it was shipped the first time and somehow the courier returned it back to Amazon.  I have to call and they have to process a ""return"" to trigger a re-send.  It costs me another 3 or 5 days.  Could have been smoother but overall it's ok.  Also, the Import fee is resonable.

I think it's pretty cool though. It's a big upgrade from my A51 that had a bad low light camera and was getting pretty slow though I only had it for a year. This phone was $600 more than the A51 and I don't think it's worth it, but I don't think any phones worth almost or more than $1,000. The front camera is very bad sometimes because it sharpens pictures too much. But when it's good, it's like the back camera of the A51. The battery lasts 9-10 hours. The only things in the box are the sim card pin, those useless papers, a charger cord,, and the phone itself, which is ridiculous. You'll have to buy all the accessories. You'll need a USB-C charging block for the cord. It also doesn't have a headphone jack if you didn't know, so you'll need Bluetooth earbuds or an adapter. I think it's a good phone, but not worth all the money. You could likely get something from the A series or S20 series that's the same, close to, or better than this for a lower price.","October 4, 2021"

I jumped from an S7 Edge to the S21+ and let me tell you, it was a huge jump, I can feel it with every swipe.

I'd had an s7 for years and experienced NO issues at all. So I felt confident in buying the s21+ as a major upgrade. The phone itself is wonderful - I had no issues with anything at all, other than it seemed to echo at times when talking to friends. A couple weeks after owning this phone for ONE YEAR, I reach for my s21+ to make a call and I see the screen is totally black. I thought it was dead, so I put it on the charger and nothing. No lights at all on the screen. No beep when plugging it in. I could still touch the screen and hear the phone clicking/vibrating as if I was using it normally, but I couldn't see a thing. I couldn't turn the phone off, despite knowing where the buttons were from muscle memory. I couldn't force a reboot either. Nothing worked. I ran through all the generic troubleshooting from Samsung and Amazon. NOTHING AT ALL WOULD WORK TO BRING THIS PHONE BACK TO LIFE. And I wasn't going to pay $300 to have the screen replaced when this was clearly not an issue with the screen - THIS IS A KNOWN SOFTWARE PROBLEM THAT SAMSUNG APPARENTLY HAS NO INTENTION OF ADDRESSING OR FIXING. It's easy for them to say ""plug it into your laptop or PC and factory reset"" but that's IMPOSSIBLE WHEN YOU CAN'T EVEN GET THE PHONE TO BOOT UP OR BE RECOGNIZED ON YOUR PC/LAPTOP!!! I searched for weeks to determine which phone I wanted to buy - this is a big purchase item and I EXPECTED IT TO LAST FOR YEARS, CONSIDERING HOW WELL I CARE FOR MY ELECTRONICS. But I barely got 54 weeks' use out of this phone, and then I was basically thrown to the wolves because I had no warranty that could be honored and no one would help me outside of saying ""replace the screen"" or ""sell it for junk parts."" THIS PERFECTLY NEW AND (UP TO THAT POINT) PERFECTLY FUNCTIONING SMARTPHONE THAT COST HUNDREDS OF MY HARD-EARNED DOLLARS IS NOW ABSOLUTELY USELESS, OTHER THAN SERVING AS A REMINDER THAT I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER SAMSUNG NOR WILL I EVER BUY ANOTHER SMARTPHONE VIA AMAZON DUE TO THEIR LACK OF AT LEAST A 1YR WARRANTY. TO SAY THAT I AM SICK OVER THIS IS A GROSS UNDERSTATEMENT.","August 13, 2024"
"SAMSUNG Galaxy S21+ Plus 5G Factory Unlocked Android Cell Phone 128GB US Version Smartphone Pro-Grade Camera 8K Video 12MP High Res, Phantom Black",ENGELBERT MAVAREZ,4.0,"Features are good but  not significantly better than my 8Plus that I replaced with it in order to access 5G.  But at first I thought it does not connect to AT&T's 5G (and initially I fated only 1 star) and the AT&T technician at my store first replaced the SIM card to be sure that is not the issue, did general trouble-shooting and the phone is good, and then told me he frequently encounters phones purchased as 'unlocked' rather than locked by AT&T that will not connect to 5G.  Amazon Customer Support was entirely clueless and unhelpful, telling e to contact Samsung.  I did so and the Customer Service Rep was clueless so I asked for a Supervisor to return my call.  She did so the next day and at first wanted me to send my phone to Samsung (10 day tunaround) because she said the unlocked phone should connect toeither AT&T or T-Mobile,  but after some discussion she offered that I could also take it to my local Samsung authorized repair place (UBreakIFix) to reflash with latest software.  I went there and on entering imy phone showed connection to 5G!!  The signal in the AT&T store (Florida City, FL) apparently was not strong enough.  So I recommend this phone - the only issue that I have with it is that how to take video  is  non-intuitive and obscure, so I have yet to succeed with anything longer than a few seconds.","November 16, 2021"
"SAMSUNG Galaxy S21+ Plus 5G Factory Unlocked Android Cell Phone 128GB US Version Smartphone Pro-Grade Camera 8K Video 12MP High Res, Phantom Black",K.L.,4.0,"I freaking LOVE my new Samsung Galaxy s21+!!! My s9 of 3 years was acting up on me so it was about time I upgraded. I heard that it only includes a recharge cable but not an adaptor, which was alright since I had to replace my own a week prior to me getting this. What I don't like (which is why I gave this phone a 4 star) is that Samsung pulled an Apple and also took out the audio output to plug in your headphones! So if you love listening to music like me, get a special type c audio adaptor for the s21 and s21+. Or if you don't mind that be sure to get wireless headphones or earbuds that support Bluetooth.  Be sure to back up all your files to your Samsung account and Google accounts (like G-Photos) that way when you do the transfer (wireless or though cable connecting) you'll get everything downloaded on your phone. Reason I say this is because these newer phones don't come with a micro SD card slot anymore, Probably because of all the extra storage it already comes with. (mine is I think 182GB) All in all, I love my new phone and have no regrets!! 🥰","April 7, 2021"

I was quite surprised however, when I began using the multiple camera format of this device because I was convinced that improvements to the S9 camera were unlikely. Whoa - so wrong! The range of photographing capabilities have been significantly advanced in this model and I coudn't be happier with the results I'm seeing. AI is in its infancy, yet there are applications in the camera of this device that offer real advantages with impressive results. Also the much larger battery is doing a much better job of reaching the end of my typical day with power remaining. For my purposes I am very glad that I decided to upgrade to the S21+ and I highly recommend this model.","January 18, 2022"

I'd keep my Mate 20, which at best is an okay phone, over this s21+ any day, but the carrier won't let it work on the network as of next year. Anyways, the good, I like the display alright... there must be something else, oh, I suppose battery life is decent. I guess it is smooth and fast out of the box, but aren't they all, flagships that is. Now for what I don't like. No headphone jack, and I knew it didn't have one, but that doesn't mean I have to like it. Display aspect ratio, please quit making these phones look like a remote control. I couldn't reach the top on 5.5 in 16x9 screen, but I could reach both sides. Now I'm even farther away from the top of these sticks. All glass, hate it. Samsung bloat, not as bad as I remember, but still there. I thought the camera was supposed to be great, but I get way to many blurry photos. Fingerprint sensor is no where's near as good as any I've had on the back of a phone. Doesn't recognize it quite often. I'll miss not having an ir blaster, still used mine daily. I'll miss not having sd card slot. I'd love a removable battery, but I know I won't see on here. It's to bad, I'd love to see android phones from 5-8 years ago with modern specs any day over the current line up of iphones wanna be's.

I know this review seems to to be not picky but if I am paying $1000 for a phone it better be amazing. Sadly Samsung did not deliver for me. This phone will push you to use more Samsung products and apps. It got really frustrating for me because I was content to using googles ecosystem. Bixby is not that good and Google assistant is so much better. This phone also has a lot of features but it feels like with this phone is that they stuffed as many features they could without having a cohesive strategy on how they work together to improve the life of the user.I will say this phone has amazing battery life and the screen movements are buttery smooth. It charges on wireless chargers fast and the screen is bright. However the skin of Android is not for me. I can see why people love the phone.,"October 30, 2021"

I purchased a Samsung Galaxy S21+ from CELL UNIVERSAL in early OCTOBER (not November). When it arrived it didn't work properly - UNLESS you consider a screen that was backwards !!  It appears not from left to right as phones do, but from RIGHT to Left. This makes things such as swiping left now require swiping right. And instead of moving the slider left to right to increase brightness, or  to increase or decrease the volume, these are backwards as well. I contacted the company CELL UNIVERSAL but got no response. When I contacted Amazon they tried to help, but all I got from CELL UNIVERSAL was questions, and no way to get a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA). After more contacts with Amazon, CELL UNIVERSAL finally sent me an address to send it back, but no RMA. Apparently they are expecting ME to pay to send it back. Overall, This company, CELL UNIVERSAL, APPEARS to be making me jump through numerous hoops without doing anything to resolve this issue. It's almost, to me, like they are trying to get me so tired of playing this game that I just give up and let them ""steal"" my $879.27 !!!  Amazon itself has been very good at trying to help with this, so it's not Amazon I'm angry at - it's strictly Cell Universal.

Camera must be from 2018. Fingerprint reader is quite demanding.Coming from Huawei P30 Pro, I expected 2 years worth of advancement, but alas it does feel like downgrade in every aspect.

The Samsung webpage is dysfunctional, with it impossible to initiate the phone warranty process (tried multiple different browsers, it just sticks you in a loop that looks to me to be intentional, I'll have to find the time to wait hours on the phone some time to start the warranty process).Additionally, coming from pixel phone, I found Samsung software to be inferior to that of the pixel in nearly every case. Phone is listed as Esim capable, but is not in US. Samsung Visual voicemail is a joke , the message app is horrible. There is absolutely nothing about this phone that gave me a better experience than my much cheaper pixel phone.Between this and my Samsung TV which is shoving ads down my face, my Samsung refrigerator whose icemaker freezes over every week, and this completely disappointment of a phone, if I never own another Samsung product again, it will be too soon.","October 24, 2021"

"SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Fold5 AI Phone, 512GB Unlocked Android Smartphone, Big 7.6” Screen for Streaming, Gaming, Dual App View, One-Hand Control, Hands-Free Use, US Version, 2023, Cream",Domestic Pianist,4.0,"This is an amazing phone with some serious pros and cons.  The pros are that it's like having a tablet that you can carry around all day.  I love it, and that I can get so much work done on long subway trips.  If you are someone who has the time to sit and work while ""on the go"", you will love it.  I prefer to flip it sideways for better/wider viewing once it is open.  Past that, you have likely heard of the other pros.  As for the cons, this is not a phone to buy used.  I spend much of my year overseas and in Korea, where the various Folds and Flips have been out for several years.  I know several other business people with Fold 3's, 4's, and they are now getting the 5's.  I also know many young university students with Flip 3's, and 4's.  What you have to know about these phones is that the inner screen is incredibly fragile, as is the video transmission cable.  They make a big deal about the hinge, but the real problems are with needing to replace the thin inner screen or cable.  The factory screen protector needs occasional replacement (8 months shows bubbling), which means giving up your phone and waiting to have it done (or shipping out) and paying for it.  Then, in colder seasons, screens tend to wear out inside of 1 to 2 years, or start to fray along the corners and at the hinge points. Basically, know that you really should get Samsung Care with this phone, or plan to get rid of it by 1 to 2 years.  Otherwise, once you exceed the base screen warranty, you will pay a ridiculous amount to replace it.  Knowing this, it is just not a good ""long term"" phone for those who like to hold onto it for years and years.  Replacing that film becomes prohibitively expensive to keep up, and a full inner screen replacement is like buying a new phone if you don't have Samsung Care.  Likewise, the used value on the Fold phones is atrocious.  How bad?  In Korea, a 1-year old Fold 4 sells for $600 or less.  That's almost a 2/3 loss in value inside of a year!  The reason why is because anyone who purchases it used will have to worry about hundreds of dollars in inner screen replacements, ribbon cable fixing, and have absolutely no coverage for them.  Despite how awesome this phone is, I think it's development was Samsung attempting to create a device that can bring in more repair profit, and shoehorn users into paying for Samsung Care.  They want you buying new phones more often, buying additional warranties, or paying through the nose for repairs.  That's really what the Fold and Flip are about.  If you have the money to burn, and don't mind upgrading every year or investing in Samsung Care and keeping it a bit longer, this phone is incredible.  For all others -- avoid it.","October 16, 2023"

Performance is good with this, at least in the US. I was using my carrier's roaming partner in Spain with their limited data and it was just so-so - I was attaching to 5g network, but performance was limited due to agreements. It worked fine for phone calls though.Screens are beautiful, crisp and vivid. The internal screen is just ""big"" and makes many things easier to use. That being said, not all apps use the space as well. The Speed Test app uses it to pop out additional information. From my understanding it is possible to do split screen apps as well, though I never did.The camera is the standard Samsung which I personally like. Some sample pictures are attached. Some may think colors are more saturated, thought the sky in the included church picture I took was actually that blue that day. Zoom is also fairly good - I included a 10x example of La Sagrada Familia.Speed tests were decent, again more of a reflection of the network. Home WIFI performance is on par or on the higher side for my network.The phone geometry takes a bit to get used to and I initially found the phone a bit slippery. It is very tall and popped out of my pocket a few times (shallow pocket). I ended up dropping the phone about 5 times the first day I got it, before I received my case. Good news is that it survived all drops well with no scratches and intact screens. Most drops were from the 3 to 4 ft range.That is another thing, and could be due to popularity as well as design. Getting a good case is not as easy as with non-folding phones. Some cases do not protect the ""binding""/edge part of the phone as well and others that fold leave a lot of space in that area which expose the outside edge of the screen.There are two things I do not like about this phone.First, the fingerprint sensor is in the on/off button, and it is not that good, at least compared to the on-screen sensor in my S22-Ultra.  It had a hard time reading my fingerprint and the placement is hard to use correctly but easy to accidentally set off where you then have to enter your pin anyway as you had too many bad reads.Second, the keyboard on the front screen is small and it is easy to mis-type letters. Even after using for over a month, I still make more mistakes than I did with my S-22 Ultra.","September 27, 2023"

That being said, the general consensus from most of the people I talked to about this phone said it's recommended to only use the inner camera for video calls, and for selfies to just use the much better cameras on the outside of the device instead (there's a way to ""send the screen"" to the back (outside) of the phone and take selfies using the main lens instead, and those turned out incredible. Like seriously better than almost any other phone I've used.The last thing I just want to add is be prepared to adjust some of the default settings. First off, the screen would dim way more often than I wanted it to, so make sure to adjust it up to 2 minutes before it goes to sleep instead of 30 seconds. The other default setting to adjust is default brightness, go in and turn that off and turn on the extra brightness option and then set it to a comfortable brightness level. I think this phone keeps the auto brightness low all the time to save battery life, but it definitely ruins the experience a bit when your phone is that dim for no reason.Overall though, this phone is amazing and I couldn't be happier with it. The storage amount was fine, the camera quality was great, the battery was pretty good, the inner screen was amazing, and the phone was such a phenomenal experience to use every day.10/10, definitely recommend, get this phone, you will not be disappointed!","September 12, 2023"

I have yet to get a new SIM for it and have been using it on wifi. The screen, colors are amazing, bright and beautiful.  The fold function is pretty awesome.  It's like carrying around a mini iPad.  The case I am using on it, the I just reviewed has a kickstand so can you pop it anywhere and watch streaming content.  Form factor is good for its size.  Height wise it is just a bit taller than my iPhone 13Pro.  Thickness folded is more than double the size.  The snap on case also adds to the overall heft.  For those that have both android and apple there is an app that allows you to send and receive imessages on android so that has eased the transition for me. The device is pretty responsive with about 30 apps on it so far.  Camera is sharp.  Wireless charging is uses the fast charging standard and the device tells you when it is in fast charge mode. A few things I don't like.  From a device hardware perspective the camera facial recognition is not great. It fails more than it works. The fingerprint sensor works about 90% of the time.  Battery life is average.  For whatI am using it for it drains pretty quickly.  The rest of the dislikes are really around android and while I know the implementation is customized for the device I cannot really give the device negative marks for it.  If they could get native iMessage in android I would sonisdr switching.","August 25, 2023"

This foldable technology is really awesome. According to the Samsung official, it's tested for 200,000 fold, which means I can fold the phone over 100 times a day in 5 years, and it is still functional.  The cover screen is 6.2 inches the inner screen is 7.6 inches, and the inner screen comes with a built-in protector.When we talk about the cameras, the iPhone's photos seem a little yellowish and not very vibrant. The Samsung phone's pictures appear brighter and maybe more appealing, but they have slightly less contrast. Taking photos at night can be challenging for phones, but both of these phones do a good job. In the low-light pictures I took of a vase, the iPhone 14 Pro Max makes some details look overly sharp, and the colors are accurate but not very bold.I found that the Galaxy Z Fold 5 has only one slot for a SIM card, even though some people thought it could have two SIM cards for US models. Overall, I really like this phone. If I discover any new information about it, I'll be sure to share updates.","September 8, 2023"
"SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Fold5 AI Phone, 512GB Unlocked Android Smartphone, Big 7.6” Screen for Streaming, Gaming, Dual App View, One-Hand Control, Hands-Free Use, US Version, 2023, Cream",Customer Review,5.0,I have been team apple for over 5 years switching from a oneplus phone back in early 2018. I thought no phone would ever win me back but the samsung fold offerings have always been intriguing to me. I did find it hard to overlook that ugly middle line especially with the older phones not folding in flat. Now that the fold 5 has offered this upgrade to actually fold flat I decided that now more than any time I would test the waters of a Android Device.The Fold 5 was easy enough to get used to it felt quite natural using the front screen for some simple stuff and opening it up for the full screen experience. It did at times feel weird watching content on such a large phone screen but it was mostly a mix of delight and amazement at how top notch the folding screen is.The camera was quite good to my amazement as I had been spoiled with the apple camera for a while. I had not seen the advancements android phones had made and I was delighted to use the zoom on the phones camera. Overall though i don't like the colors quite as much and I feel the photos have a little less character than an iphone but still a great camera with many more cool gimmicks than the iphone a big win in my book.I was a little concerned about weight when i got the phone but in hand it didnt feel as heavy as i thought. The bigness of the phone was a little daunting at first as it was both thicker and longer. This is definitely a big disadvantage to me as the bulge is quite apparent in most of my pants even though it is a narrower phone when folded up.I do want to quickly also say this phone does look beautiful and the bevels are so small now on these phones the screen looks amazing. Even though at times i see the curve of the large screen it doesnt bother as much as i though tit would only when things go dark do i really see it noticeably. The screen is also very bright.Positives: Great ScreenFast Snappy PerformanceFast ChargingNegatives: Front Screen is a little narrow (not good for typing)I did not get great battery life even when new about 1 day but many times didnt make it to the day mark. that comfortably.,"September 3, 2023"

HIGHLY recommend this phone if you are into work productivity OR into gaming, as it does both with ease. I’ve always been an iPhone and iPad kinda person, but this Samsung phone is literally like carrying a powerful laptop in your pocket. I’ve been playing Pokemon Go, Pikmin Bloom, and Golf Clash while logging my walks on Runkeeper, chatting with work folks using Slack, engaged in Teams or Zoom meetings, opening MS Word and PPTX docs - this phone does it all.  I’m not even using a cell connection yet, I'm just piggybacking on my work iPhone hotspot, and yet this Z-fold outperforms it!  At 256GB, this phone goes above and beyond the processing capability of my other phones.The large, beautiful Z-fold screen makes this phone so unique, and adds extra usability. It’s like having a mini-tablet and a cell phone all rolled into one!  The “back” screen is the tall narrow single screen that is utilized when the phone is folded/closed, and the “front” screen is the large rectangular screen that is twice as wide and very useful for work applications like word processing, slide shows and spreadsheets, and not to mention video calls. I like that it folds up small to fit in my pocket, and then folds out to give me a nice, big display screen when I need one.If you are thinking of investing in this phone, do keep in mind that it is heavy and slick, so if you plan on having it last, please invest in a case sooner rather than later!And lastly, the camera takes nice sharp photos, the phone has a very high quality screen display, and this phone also utilizes facial recognition as well as fingerprint technology, both of which have worked great for me - no issues there. Charging time is about the same as my other phones, BUT this phone seems to have a superior battery life compared to my other phones. For instance, under similar circumstances, the Z fold will still be at 70% while my other phones are already down to 40%!Overall, I think this unique phone is one of the best phones I have ever had, certainly one of the most versatile!","August 31, 2023"

Mind you I have an unlocked phone with T-Mobile.The phone itself is beautiful and feels great in my hand. But the screen, the screen is so impressive.

Less worried about putting the phone in my back pocket now. It can definitely handle more weight on it since it folds completely flat now but I still try to keep my phone in the front pocket.

The ultra s23 still has the better camera.There is still the crease you can see, especially from side angle.

But it provides a lot of features and especially unique extra ways to use all of its screen space. Almost all of my smart device usage has been in the IOS world ... and so a lot of what I am experiencing right now is just getting used to this new, slightly different way of doing things. But I am certainly not disappointed by anything thus far.My foremost favorite feature so far is just in the extra large, brilliant screen that this device has to offer. I suffer with some eye issues, but this large screen allows me to enlarge things to a size that is comfortable to view. Just this morning I was able to use it as my Sunday morning church service (digital) Bible which was so much easier to read than the paper version I had used previously. And even though it can be opened to be about half the size of a tablet for easy viewing, it can still be folded to easily fit into my shirt pocket. Plus it has powerful functionality in either format.With just a few days of usage I certainly can't say that I have explored anything more than the top surface layer of this super powerful device. But I am looking forward to getting acquainted with all that it can do once I get it more completely set up and configured to match my tastes and requirements. If you have the deep pockets necessary to invest in this device, I am very doubtful that you will be disappointed in all the things it is capable of doing for you.

Just holding it in your hand you can tell it’s a solid phone. The screens displays are very vibrant and clean. I am use to the other OS so this is a new world to me. I now have settings for settings LOL. I can set things up for my preferences the way I want and use. Split screen is still confusing to me so I won’t go there. One of the first apps I went to install was a game. It had issues where the game was set up for a different screen resolution. I couldn’t do anything with the outer borders. I was discouraged till I found a setting for apps. You could set individual apps to run in different screen settings. Full that I already know was not working for my app. Then there was 4x3 and 16x9. With the app set to 16x9 the all worked flawless. There are so many settings if something is not how you want it. You can explore or google what you want. This just might be the wedge to keep me away from the other OS for good.I am having minor issues with face recognition not working too well especially in low light. Along with the finger print reader not working all the time. I am working with equipment I’m not use to. I will redo the both it could be my error. I only mentioned here incase others are having the same issue. From me this phone gets a solid 5 stars,"August 21, 2023"

Until seeing them side by side I really didn't realize how much slimmer they look because the crease folds flat instead of having that extra kind of bump on the outer side of it where it didn't fold flat before. It definitely feels just a little bit lighter when you hold it which is overall nice because let's face it these are incredibly bulky phones when they're folded up together. That really does feel like the biggest difference between the previous generation and the current phone. But it really makes a difference in how you use it. If you're going back and forth between getting the previous generation and the new one I'm definitely going to say lean towards the 5. The way it feels, the responsiveness, the screen brightness are all going to be an upgrade from the previous phone and it's definitely noticeable when you're using it all day. It's a great phone and I look forward to how much further they take them.If you currently have the 4 it's not a necessary update but a nice one. If you have the 3 it's definitely worth the upgrade. And if you're still looking for a foldable this is great one to use. The multitasking functionalities are amazing and well integrated and definitely makes it feel more like a portable tablet then just a phone.","August 17, 2023"

Glide texting is super smooth and the screen quality is unreal. With the screen off there is a very noticeable crease but it virtually disappears when you turn it one. I don't even notice it 90% of the time. I was able to connect my Galaxy watch with no problems and they're working very well together.Setting the phone up was as easy as installing my SIM card.

It is extremely difficult to type on it because of the over sensitive keyboard. I've been having troubles with it randomly opening split screens on its own.It has three screens. The front facing and then the two joined panels when you fold it out. The front facing screen is WAY too thin to do basic work on it, so you practically always have to unfold your phone to do anything.Furthermore the image quality of the cameras is pretty unremarkable. It's fuzzy and not very clear. I expected better performance from itPros: it has a task bar that lets you switch between tasks easily, and there are some gestures that are essential to making this phone work like putting your palm in the screen to shut it down. There is not any documentation provided with the phone so you have to learn these from YouTube.The split screens can be both up and down or left to right. However due to the resolution of the screen, no matter what, you will always have black bars when you watch things like YouTube. It can never truly be ""full screen"" which frankly looks ugly.There's just too many nitpicks I have on this phone that make it not as convenient for me to use compared to my old, less flashy galaxy note 9.

I’ve noticed when I use the bigger inside screen it loses battery more quickly than when I’m just using the outside “back” screen.I don’t love the size, girls pockets are small enough as is, and this is much more bulky than my iPhone so it’s hard to fit it in my pocket.The photos I’ve taken with the back/outside camera are incredible! To be honest I think they are better than my iPhone. The photos I’ve taken with the inside of selfie camera are terrible.Overall I’m not ready to switch over from iPhone to galaxy yet, but I’m not opposed to it either. The galaxy phone is very impressive.","September 23, 2023"
"SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Fold5 AI Phone, 512GB Unlocked Android Smartphone, Big 7.6” Screen for Streaming, Gaming, Dual App View, One-Hand Control, Hands-Free Use, US Version, 2023, Cream",keith howard,5.0,This phone has a clear screen. Amazing cameras and a long lasting battery. When unfolded the screen is clear and easy to read. It is sensitive to touch and works well. When unfolded there is a small crease in the screen that is noticeable at times but not distracting. Thicker than most phones this does not fit in standard car phone holders. Adding the optional stylus adds even more function.,"October 20, 2023"

I needed a second one so I decided to give the Samsung Galaxy a try as I heard good things, saw good reviews and it looked awesome. Wow!  This phone does not disappoint.  Picture is crisp, sound is clear, and camera is tight. I was a little eerie about a split screen but it works perfect. And the size is great for watching movies when traveling. My favorite feature though has to be dual app viewing. I didn’t realize how much I needed this until I started using it. Overall this is an awesome phone. If you need to step away from the I universe or you want to be a part of both like me, this is a great phone to have. It truly is next level.","August 15, 2023"

The first thing I noticed was the width of the phone and the flexibility to fold the phone. The phone is very slim when it’s extended out flat. The cinematic screen is big and has the most clear and vibrant colors to it. With dual view I can share my screen and work on two things. It has a large storage capability. I definitely recommend upgrading to the new version of Galaxy Z Fold5. There is a lot new for me to explore and it makes it all very exciting.,"August 26, 2023"

I had the 3 and upgraded when this one came out. The screen is amazing, showing full screen without any signs of the fold in the screen. It is sturdily built and designed, surviving drops and falls. The memory seems to be never-ending. The speed is fantastic and there is rarely a problem with any lagging or dropping. The speaker sound is great, even without a bluetooth device synced. The call quality is very clear. The factory color is nice. There is no lag when using earbuds or headphones. I am very pleased with my Fold 5!","September 21, 2023"

"SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Fold5 AI Phone, 512GB Unlocked Android Smartphone, Big 7.6” Screen for Streaming, Gaming, Dual App View, One-Hand Control, Hands-Free Use, US Version, 2023, Cream",Francisca zuniga,5.0,"This is the most amazing phone ever and opens into the nicest little tablet, but also could replace my desktop computer.  From the first photo that I posted, are the CPU Benchmarks that shows this benches over 20,000 (Geekbench 4 score) and honestly this is just mind blowing!  I have a desktop computer that I use for graphic design where I need all of the big name design programs that require a lot of processing power and my desktop is fast, but it only scores 14,000.  When I saw the benchmarks of this phone and ran the tests several times, it really has me thinking that this could replace my desktop computer since the scores are 40% faster!  This phone supports Samsung DeX which is a desktop mode that allows the same experience as a desktop computer to utilize all of your apps on the phone with a seamless interface.  So that would mean you could keep your computer with you at all times.  In my photos that I posted, you can see that I attached a USB-C cord to the phone and a portable monitor, this was an immediate connection without any fussing.  Well, kinda, my monitor is too low a resolution for it to work properly, so when doing so, a higher resolution monitor is needed.Aside from using it as a computer, the phone quality is pretty amazing.  Having the ability to unfold a phone into a tablet is a great experience.  I was a bit concerned with the screen crease, but when using it, you really cannot see the crease at all.  When the phone is off, yes, you can see it and feel a slight bump when swiping across the screen.  The color and clarity is beautiful and it performs beyond expectations.  I also did some graphics testing to see the raytracing capabilities and the overall score was 5,623 and the Wild Life Extreme test which is 90% better than any other device available today! (according to 3DMARK Solar Bay test).  When doing these tests, I did notice that the phone got noticeably warm so I measured it at over 103 degrees, see photo.While I like to do testing of CPU and Graphics abilities, that is where my tech ends.  The other features and specs I am sure you can find via the manufacturer.  But from a user point of view, I find the camera to be better than any other phone that I have had.  I snapped some photos of flowers and yard ornaments to display the photo quality, and of course my cat wanted to be involved too.When using the phone. I do find that it is quite narrow and for fat finger typing it is a bit tight.  When unfolding the phone I see that it is not perfectly square, it is about 1/2 inch different.  So if they would have put the fold the other direction, then the phone would be wider and shorter and in my opinion far superior to the orientation that it is now.  It would have made it much easier to type on and better fitting in my pocket.  The phone is very glossy and slippery, much to slippery to the point that I am very concerned about it slipping out of my hand when using it.  So I will be looking for that perfect case right away!  The three camera lenses on the back are raised from the phone so when setting it down, it is at quite a tilt and directly on the lens, so that seems like a risk of damage as well.Opening and folding the phone is very stiff and I find that it requires two hands to carefully pry open and when closing I have to put pressure on the inside screen fold and carefully clack it shut.  The hinge is metal and seems engineered very well.  I thought that the inner screen would have a noticeable gap underneath when folding, but this is not the case.  I see no risk of getting debris under the screen so this is a welcome update.Even though you can unfold this phone, it really is not very thick and when unfolded it is quite thin.  It fits nicely in my hand as well as my pocket when folded.  It is lightweight and not cumbersome whatsoever.  The front screen is very touch responsive and vivid color and fast.  There is a sim card slot on the side, which is different than others.  There is space for two, but the first sim slot is blocked out, as that is reserved for the esim, but there is an actual slot for a sim card.  There is not a micro SD slot, so that was kind of a disappointment.  The stereo speakers are quite amazing as there is noticeable bass and this gives it a deep rich sound and even at the highest volume there was no distortion.Overall this is hands down the most amazing phone that I have ever used.  Samsung really did get this right.  You can tell they put a lot of thought into the engineering and polishing of the design as well as the software to allow for the larger screen.  Also to be able to replace your desktop, this phone is a real contender, especially the fact that it is much faster than my current desktop computer.  With all that said, honestly, I cannot find one single flaw aside from it being slippery, but a good case should cure that.","August 23, 2023"

It is much easier to browse the internet and I love the dual screen option. That itself is awesome to be able to do on the phone. Sound quality is good.

The middle screen folds open and looks virtually the same as a small tablet. It's very impressive. It has great graphics, and the sound is better than I expected. The camera is also quite impressive.

It's comfortable in your hand and has NFC, a user-replaceable battery, and a microSD storage slot. It also has a little larger screen than it's predecessor.The Bad: Its screen is a bit dimmer than competitors' but not too much. You may not even notice it. I found the Galaxy S4's power button turned on at undesirable times. If you were a critic of the GS3's plastic construction, you'll be disappointed with this one as well. Not a game changer for me though.I think it offers a little more give if you drop it. A long list of software features could overwhelm and confuse the inexperienced user.The Ugly: Not a thing ugly about this phone!The bottom line: Its laundry list of features require time and effort to truly master, but the Galaxy S4 is the top choice for anyone looking for a big-screen, do-everything smartphone.

"Samsung Galaxy S6, Black Sapphire 32GB (AT&T)",JD91,5.0,"The Galaxy S6 is an outstanding smartphone.  Not to be confused with its sibling, the S6 Edge, it makes up for the lack of a touch screen that extends to the sides of the phone with its lower price.  Otherwise the phones are identical in features and capabilities which are long and impressive.  The screen, with is slightly larger than the S5, is bright and, to date, has the highest resolution of any smartphone and is extremely responsive with virtually no noticeable lag when touched.  Although it does not have the Snapdragon processor, which is the fastest in the industry, it does have two slower quad-core processors working in tandem which gives the phone phenomenal speed and multitasking capabilities.  The improvements added since the S5 are built-in wireless charging capabilities that meet the Q1 standard, Gorilla Glass 4, the latest shock resistant touch glass from Corning.  The already impressive camera is improved with an increased aperture enabling a greater sensitivity to ambient light and much wider pictures to accompany a superb auto focusing system.  And addressing the complaints of the S5's plastic case, the S6 has a thinner and lighter aluminum body.  The thinner body also makes the S6 ideal for use with a protective case or shell.  Lastly, the latest version of Android seems perfectly suited for each feature of the phone, especially the S6 Edge, making it more than a match for Apple's iPhone 6 in both speed and ease of use while exceeding it in capabilities and functionality.However, the S6 does have its drawbacks but they are few.  Like the S4 and S5, the battery life is pretty much just below average, most likely due to supporting the twin processors and that bright, hi-res screen.  But unlike the S4 and S5, the battery in the S6 is not removable so you can't upgrade it with an increased capacity aftermarket version.  This is most like due to the wireless charging capability.  Samsung claims to combat this issue with built-in power management software that can extend battery life, enable rapid charging and improve battery performance as it learns the characteristics of the battery in conjunction with your usage patterns.  I can attest that the S6 does charge fairly quickly although slightly slower using wireless charging.  And Q1 wireless charging can be a quirky since the power adapter must match the amperage and voltage of the Samsung S6 adapter precisely for it to work reliably. If you're intent on using wireless charging, I recommend using a Q1 charger with an extra Samsung S6 adapter.  It also only has a single, although highly capable, speaker which is surprisingly loud considering its small size.  Like the S5, the S6 delivers much better high fidelity stereo sound when using the speaker jack or a bluetooth speaker/headphone connection.  Another drawback is that the S6 has no MicroSD card slot so you are limited to built-in memory.  However, Samsung does offer three memory options (32, 64 and 128 GB) as opposed to the usual two (16 / 32 or 32 / 64 GB) which entail additional costs with each increase in memory (another reason to opt for an S6 with increased memory as opposed to an S6 Edge for the same price).Overall, the S6 is an excellent response from Samsung after the unimpressive sales performance of the S5.  While the S6 Edge is definitely the best looking smartphone on the market, you may not find its side areas worth the added expense when compared to the normal S6.  The regular S6, though, has the edge (no pun intended) over its more glamorous sibling simply because the additional money required to purchased an Edge can be used to increase the built-in memory which, in my opinion, will do more to extend the functional life of the phone giving you more room for applications and other software.  I definitely consider this phone to be the best on the market to date and have no problem recommending it for anyone looking for a phone packed with features and capabilities.","July 14, 2015"
"Samsung Galaxy S6, Black Sapphire 32GB (AT&T)",Mattressburn,5.0,"Very impressed with not only this, but also the distributer for it. I was very hesitant on purchasing a phone second hand, as this was my first android device, and also the first phone I bought off-contract, so i wanted to be sure i was satisfied. To my surprise, this phone came in in AMAZING condition, with no scratches on the glass front or back, and all the buttons and ports working perfectly. The only blemishes are on the top and bottom rails, but I definitely did not mind this since it's a lot better than the glass being scratched. The one biggest fear I had was the battery condition, as I have learned from previous experience that phone batteries are always the first thing to go. And again, the battery in this phone was in exceptional condition, so no need to change it out!Now on to the phone, the phone is your standard top-of-the-line flagship and it definitely has beaten any phones i have previously used. The screen is VERY bright and the colors are fantastic, and the 1440p display really shows the capabilities of this device. I waited a little over a month before posting a review to be sure the phone had no 'surprises' soon after i got it, as that sometimes happens with used devices, however i am very pleased with this and highly recommend anyone to purchase this phone, and do not fear buying it used as long as you can see the device before buying it.The only complaints i have to this phone is 1. the battery, as stated above, is not removable. The battery life definitely isn't the best, but if you pick up a fast charger like i did, you'll instantly forgive it. I have work and school and have made it to the end of the day without killing the battery, which is good enough for me. 2. While it may be different per person, the seller i purchased my phone from stated it came with a generic charger, in which is true. I do recommend picking up a fast charger, however i do wish the seller included it. Nevertheless, that is a small complaint because they are very cheap and easy to get, in the end, i recommend this phone highly, even by today's standards it holds up very well against other phones, and even my sister who has a 6s loves using this!","August 9, 2016"
"Samsung Galaxy S6, Black Sapphire 32GB (AT&T)",JD91,4.0,"This phone was purchased on December 09, 2015 from Amazon and it was delivered on December 11, 2015.  I chose the 128GB version  because Samsung chose not to give the purchaser the ability to add a micro SD card.Over the years I have had many cell phones. Sony, Casio and Motorola and now my second Samsung.  My first Samsung (S5) was returned within days due to a factory problem.I ordered a Otterbox Commuter case when I purchased my S6 and it works great and is still small enough to fit in my pocket when I go out.Pros:**The phone is a comfortable size for my hand  (2.78 inches, 0.27 inches, 5.65 inches)  and has a good size screen and the resolution is fantastic. Everything looks incredibly sharp and vibrant on this phone.**Easy to use UI that is not very different from any other android phone and very easy to use.**The camera takes the best pictures of any cell phone I have every owned and has some great features if you take pictures constantly you will really like this camera**The availability of the Samsung wireless charger which I have and love.**I use my phone as a hotspot for my tablet all day long and so far have had no problem with the battery running down before the end of the day.Cons:**No SD card slot therefore you can not expand your memory beyond 16GB, 32GB or the 128GB phone you purchased.  If you save a lot of items to your phone you may run out of memory quicker that you think.  Some of us choose NOT to send our personal information to the cloud and would like the ability to save everything to our phone with out having to spend an extra couple of hundred dollars to get the extra memory space.**The battery is not removable.  I like to hold on to my phone as long as possible before purchasing a new one.  The limiting factor seems to be the battery life.  On previous phones I could just go to Amazon and find a new OEM battey for my phone an drop it in but, with this phone that is not a available option.The single biggest CON I have for this phone is that on February 1, 2015 (just 52 days after getting it) my new S6 lost all google services.  No google search, google play store, google apps or any other other items associated with google worked at all.  At the end of three days of researching and numerous phone calls (called my carrier, Google, Samsung)  my S6 was able to be fixed by the third Samsung representative at the local Best Buy.  Just in case this happens to anyone else I will include the steps she had to take to fix my phone.1: Log out of G-Mail.2: Update firmware (the Samsung rep has to do this).3: Go to application manager and clear data for all Google apps.4: Factory reset the phone.After much checking on line and with the forums it seems that according to the forums about fifteen to twenty percent of the Samsung S5 and S6 phone have this problem.  The problem is fixable but, really annoying.One more thing if you have a vehicle with bluetooth make sure to check that your vehicle supports your new phone model.Over all the phone works great and does what it was designed to do.  I'm not sure if I would purchase another Samsung phone or not and only time will tell if it woks great in the long haul or if I go back to Motorola.","February 18, 2016"
"Samsung Galaxy S6, Black Sapphire 32GB (AT&T)",Amazon Customer,1.0,"To start off the phone looks nice though it is a little slick. I've never really used cases on phones before but I will buy one for this phone.It gets 3 stars for a few reasons.The bloatware.... Just starting it up I was prompted over and over again for this samsung app and that. Really manufacturers need to calm down on their own skins and programs. I know Android had an ugly history but now it looks great. Where Android is the ugly ducking that grew into a swan. Touchwiz has seen better days. The colors scheme is such a far cry from where stock Android is going. The themes not any better. In fact I don't know who has worse themes. Touchwiz or Swiftkey. Do yourself a favor and download Nova launcher if you're used to a stock android look. Though you still can't get rid of the horrible looking notification pull down. Seriously who thought seafoam was a good idea.The keyboard is horrible. It is the worst keyboard imaginable. Trying to get through all of these Samsung screens an activating my phone was a huge pain with this keyboard. I wanted to chuck my new phone across the room. I had to get into the play store stop it from updating and download the Google Keyboard just so I could finish activating it. Luckily I was at home with wifi. Yes I am taking a star away even though I can download a new keyboard. Had they left the google keyboard in the phone it would've been fine, but no we gotta take the keyboard away to make room for some apps and games I will never ever use.Samsung you make great phones but horrible software. Leave that to Google and stop skinning their OS and coming up with your own keyboard. This is a 5 star phone if you leave it alone after the hardware.I'll comeback and update this after a few months.1 Week updateI am returning the phone. It is an upgrade over my Nexus 5 in 3 ways.1. It's prettier, but you need a case so who cares2. Its camera is amazing3. The screen has a higher resolution than my TVThose 3 things cannot save this phone though. The battery....Haha hope you're always near a charger. I had to charge it 3 times in one day. All I use my phones for is GPS phone calls web browsing and music. I don't play games on my phone. I really do nothing processor intensive. What finally made me return this was the heat. While browsing the web it would heat up. While sitting on the bed untouched for over 3 hours it would heat up.Maybe I got a defective unit, but if reading the comments about the battery life are any indication I am not in the minority.","May 2, 2015"
"Samsung Galaxy S6, Black Sapphire 32GB (AT&T)",RAJ,5.0,"Have owned an S3, S4, Note 4, and now S6.  Samsung makes an excellent product. The S6 was for my son who is at college studying to be an engineer.  He LOVES this phone.  The phone is fast, sleek, logical, intuitive and highly functional.  We are amazed at each successive generation for the improvements and innovation that bring the Samsung product along.  One benefit not often though of is that Samsung seems to develop and support software updates more frequently.  They roll out the updates to many other older generations of their lines too which means your phone stays much more functional and safe for the time you own it.  Some brands do not seem to roll out updates as Samsung does-it is not that there are issues but that they constantly innovate.  This fact along is reason enough to purchase a S6 but paired with the excellent aesthetics and quality build-you can't go wrong.**Please note-I do not recommend trading in your old cell phone through Amazon. The phone that this new S6 replaced was sent in it's original box, in perfect working order with excellent battery & original equipment cables having been protected by cases & screen protectors throughout it's 2 yrs of usage. It very clearly met the criteria listed for being in the top tier yet it was downgraded to a lower value. After it a long shipping voyage there, now they shipped it back (not yet received!) taking many weeks!  Amazon evidently uses vendors to evaluate trade ins-had I know it was a third party then I would never have bothered!  This is a money making venture but not for you the consumer. Don't make the mistake of factoring in a trade in for your purchase of a new phone.  If you do decide to flip the coin and try it-take photos of the phone, photos of serial numbers and photos of every single thing.  I do not recommend that you use Amazon trade in for your old phone.  This one was in perfect condition and only 2 years old top quality-premium phone still sold today!  Better to keep it as a spare of donate it & write it off your taxes.  Very frustrated and extremely dis-satisfied by the trade in experience-especially as it was through Amazon.  I honestly expect more and this will influence whether I purchase another phone through Amazon or if I go to my carrier who had an offer of $100 for trade in value on this phone. Lesson learned-it pays to shop around and factor in your trade in value with the purchase but I choose to be loyal to Amazon rather than my carrier.Some things we don't like are NO SD card!  Though you can readily use cloud services of many kinds to safeguard your info, many of us still prefer to have that SD card.  I also am not a huge fan of not being able to remove the battery myself.  This model moves towards the Apple method of doing things where any little thing you want done has to be done at a store, shipped in or can't be done!Screen:The Gorilla glass is excellent and top quality. The clarity and resolution of the screen is outstanding-just when I thought my Note 4 was the greatest, they go and improve within the few months between the time that it came out and the new S6.Conclusion:I highly recommend this phone.  We have two tablets, and have had five Samsung phones and been very happy with them all.  They work well together and the quality is outstanding.","April 16, 2015"
"Samsung Galaxy S6, Black Sapphire 32GB (AT&T)",Mattressburn,3.0,"Initiallunch, I was going to give this a 1-star review because i ordered the 128gb version but received a 32gb phone!  Very, very frustrating. However, Amazon chat rep was very helpful. Although, I only found the chat option by accident as I searched and searched the Amazon site looking for a way to contact them because I has a time constraint due to planned overseas travel in less than 2 weeks. The condition of the phone I ordered was reportedly Used-Like new. The phone I received was indeed as advertised except for the critical aspect of being 1/4 the memory I'd paid for. As the chat rep and I exploited options, it became apparent no like-condition 128gb device waa available. I was resigned to simply returning the phone and looking for other options for my trip when the chat rep offered an equitable refund for the difference in value between the phone I received ad the one I'd paid for. With my time constraint, I needed Amazon to act more quickly than their policy guidelines allow them to respond. After a few conversations with customer service, explaining the situation multiple times, they came through with the refund in just a couple of days. Therefore, I added 2 stars to this review. I wanted Amazon and the seller to understand their order fulfillment processes have a serious flaw as neither company ensured the correct item was being provided.As for the phone itself. It arrived with a dead, dead battery. I researched the problem online and found a recommendation to leave out on a charger for 15 minutes. I did so and found that the screen responded after 10 minutes. Then the phone charged to 100% within 1 hour 50 minutes using my wife's fast charger. The charger that came with the phone is almost useless - a generic, 1amp charger not normally used with Samsung phones.  I use these of nothing else is available. After all this, I took the phone to Verizon and got it activated in just a few minutes. That was a week ago, and it has gone through 3 system updates in that time. Except for the lack of memory I was so looking forward to, the phone is great. Like new physically and all the software and apps are working as expected.","November 15, 2017"
"Samsung Galaxy S6, Black Sapphire 32GB (AT&T)",Technocat,5.0,"Decided to upgrade from my Galaxy S4 after 2 years and I am so glad that I did. This thing is so smooth and powerful that its hard to believe phone internals and tech have come along this far even in two years.I was a little upset that they got rid of the removable battery and the expandable memory, but then kind of thought about how little i really accessed those two thing on my S4.Say goodbye to the plastic casing. Not that this really bothered me because I always put my phones in a case, but the finish on this thing is incredible.Previously I didn't think much about wireless charging. Now... LOVE IT. Being able to just plunk this thing down on a pad and walk away is great. I have yet to have an issue with it connecting on first placement onto the CHOE Stadium Qi Wireless Charger. Even with a Spigen Neo Hybrid case wrapped around it.Camera... So smooth and quick on boot up. Double click the home button even with the phone is idle and BAM the camera is up and running and ready to shoot. Just remember to remove the little protective cover around the lens that they place there for shipping.The screen is beautiful and colors are very vivid. Brightness can range from almost nonexistent to nice and visible in the noon sun.One tip I will share is go ahead and sign up for the advanced calling (aka HD Voice) with Verizon. With out doing that you will not have data and calling at the same time. From what I have read it has to do with they removed an antenna in the phone to either slim the phone down or to free up space for other things, and that everyone is moving to the new Voice over LTE system anyway. No extra cost. Google ""advanced calling 1.0"" and you can get the details.","April 22, 2015"
"Samsung Galaxy S6, Black Sapphire 32GB (AT&T)",RPI Engineer,5.0,"I've had this phone a couple months now and it works great. I upgraded from a Galaxy S2, which used to get overheated sometimes when charging or even just when using it a lot. The S6 has never yet overheated and it's obviously much faster than my old phone.The fingerprint reader works really well. There are some times when it doesn't read my thumbprint at first try, but I just re-place my thumb and it usually works after that. It seems to be as accurate as the fingerprint reader on my wife's iphone 6 plus.I also bought the Samsung wireless charging pad and I can charge the phone even with the Spigen TPU case on it. I do have to make sure the phone is centered on the charging pad, but I'd rather deal with that than wear out the micro USB port like on my old phone. The downside of the wireless charging is that sometimes the charging stops after reaching 100% during the night. So I'll wake up to my phone having dropped down to 94% or so. Sometimes the charger does seem to keep it at 100%, but I'm not sure why it doesn't do that all the time.Speaking of charging, the battery life on this phone is great. Even if I start the morning at like 94%, I can spend time surfing the web in the morning before work or listening to the radio over the phone (using bluetooth speaker). Then I'll use the phone occasionally during the day and I almost never have to worry about topping up the battery during the day. On my old phone (even with a new battery) I always had to top off the battery during the day. With the S6, the battery is plenty for most days of typical use for me. I can even go for a long bike ride using Strava and will have plenty of battery life left when I get home.Finally, I bought this phone at a nice discount using Amazon Warehouse Deals. It was listed as ""like new"" and it really was. I couldn't find any blemishes or defects on the phone at all.","October 26, 2015"
"Samsung Galaxy S6, Black Sapphire 32GB (AT&T)",BrnFrnld,4.0,"First let me say I love this phone.  I have to admit though, for the first month or so...  I wondered what I'd gotten myself into, as I wound up totally obsessed with how much battery life was left, because it went so fast.  I purchased an ""Anker 2nd Gen Astro E5 16000mAh Portable Charger External Battery Power Bank with PowerIQ Technology 2-Port 3A "" to help, so I could at least leave home and not worry quite as much that I'd wind up with a dead phone running errands.  Even so, I still continued to find my focus on my dwindling battery life.  I am not one of those people who previously had a Samsung Galaxy anything, so it was not due to being disappointed with the non-removable battery like some previous customers have been.  I previously had several iPhone versions before making the switch this spring and never had an issue with battery life.  I finally solved the problem by setting my phone to the first Power Saving Mode.  I'm disappointed it was necessary to do so, and I hope in two years when I may be ready to pick up a new phone again that Samsung will have FIXED this flaw in their phone, so you can use it for at least a day or so before needing to tether it to something.  For now, using the Power Saving Mode has made it last a day or so and I'm no longer frantically keeping track of the battery power (in large part because I do have that back up Anker 'brick' I can use if it runs low or out)It does take amazing pictures, the screen clarity is also amazing and I love it.  It's slim and light enough that with the Spigen Air Cushion crystal clear case it still fits in my pocket easily.I've read a lot of complaints about the still existent bloatware and that some things that don't come with the phone from Samsun and that you elect to download also can't be gotten rid of once downloaded, which is a detractor as well.  I've been afraid to add anything by Samsung for fear I wouldn't be able to delete it, only 'disable' it.  I have a 64 g, but had intended to get 128g but none were available in gold, so I settled for the 64.I also have a complaint about these companies like Samsung and Apple who have all this hype over new products coming out and lead you to believe you'll be able to get what they advertise.  This is not the case.  I waited till the end of April and was told the sapphire case which is what I fell in love with would not be available in the US, though it's available in many other places.  And that perhaps it might be available around the HOLIDAYS.  Right... so I was supposed to either wait till the end of the year or I guess they think I'll buy another one then.  Not likely.  Just a very dissatisfied Samsung Sales Tactics customer now.  That pretty much felt like a big feck you to me, from the Samsung Corp.So... sure I'd recommend this phone, it's very nice.  But, I may not buy another... will have to see how Samsung does in the future.  I don't enjoy being made to feel the fool.","June 26, 2015"
"Samsung Galaxy S6, Black Sapphire 32GB (AT&T)",Alan,3.0,"I have had this phone for 5 days now and I figured I would review my experience with the phone so far. The phone its self is absolutely amazing. Best display on a smartphone to date, best camera on a smartphone, beefy tech specs, attractive design, etc. All of this should warrant a 5 star review right? Wrong. The battery life on this phone is absolutely terrible. I have done my research and went out of my way to remove bloatware, adjust phone settings to conserve power, every little trick I could find online and still the battery life is not good enough for me to say ""it is a reliable phone"".The sad thing is that I don't think it is Samsung's fault. I think it has more to do with the wireless carrier (in my case Verizon, but I hear same issues exist with AT&T). Basically, I will charge my phone up to 100% (fast charge is great and works as advertised), then I just watch my battery drain even when my phone is inactive laying on my desk top. When I look at the battery statistics, something called ""call standby"" drains the phone battery even when I am not using it. In fact, it is by far the biggest battery drain on the phone even over a 4k super amoled display with full brightness. What the heck is going on Verizon?I looked into it further and saw many other people having the same issue. I noticed that my phone is always sending and receiving information to the Verizon network even when I am not using the phone. What is being sent? Does this have something to do with the NSA? Seriously. Last night I charged my phone to 100% just before bed, I cleared all apps loaded on the RAM just to see how what the battery percentage would be like in the morning and just sitting there on my night stand my phone drained 43% of the battery.Honestly, if this issue is not fixed, I am going to reactivate my old galaxy s5. I never had this issue on my s5. Hope this issue gets resolved soon or Verizon and Samsung just lost a long time customer.","April 30, 2015"
"Samsung Galaxy S6, Black Sapphire 32GB (AT&T)",JD91,5.0,"I'm own a Galaxy S5 and I too was skeptical when the Galaxy S6 was announced due to the sealed in battery and non expandable memory. Then I realized that while I owned the Galaxy S5 for a full year, I never even once replaced its battery. I also realized that I was only using 30 GB out of the 64 GB micro SD card I have had on my S5 for a year. Those two facts made the non replaceable battery and non expandable memory non issues for me.Now let's talk about the Galaxy S6.I was never bothered by the use of plastic on the previous models, but the new design lines are beautiful. The phone is a work of art. It feels lighter and thinner than the S5. The screen is the most beautiful on a smartphone. The new fingerprint sensor is a lot better and makes unlocking your phone much much faster and accurate. The speaker is louder than the GS5 and I like the fact that it's placed on the bottom right. I also like how the power button is now lower on the right side and that the volume rockers are two separate buttons. I haven't taken that many pictures with the rear camera, but it's a lot snappier and pictures are better than on the GS5. I love how much faster the camera starts and love that I can double tap the home button to launch the camera. . The front facing camera is amazing. No more bad selfies. I also like the fact that you can take a picture by touching the heart rate sensor. The whole phone is a lot faster and data transfer rates are also faster. Touchwiz is lighter and cleaner and Lollipop is a beautiful, fluid OS. Another great feature is fast charging. I was able to go from 0 to 100% battery in just a little over an hour. Who needs removable battery when you can recharge that quickly? The screen is so sharp, WOW!Anyway, this phone is a beast. I highly recommend it.","April 14, 2015"
"Samsung Galaxy S6, Black Sapphire 32GB (AT&T)",Mattressburn,4.0,"I'm reviewing a used product, for one, and two, will also be reviewing the ""upgrade"" from an S3 to an S6. Firstly, the condition of this phone was definitely better than expected. Sometimes ""very good"" to one, may not be so ""very good"" to another, but in this instance, it was definitely in barely used condition. Also, quick shipping, as well. Just because someone has Prime, doesn't necessarily mean you'll get your order delivered in the time you hope, like 2 days... I digress.Moving on to the model... why, oh why did Samsung mess with a good thing? I LOVED the Galaxy S3. Granted, moving up to that from my old HTC Incredible was a little daunting, but once I got used to it I loved everything about it. Over time, unfortunately, it got slower and slower. Hanging texts, forever to download anything, etc. I don't hate the S6, but I dislike how they removed the SD slot. Why? Not just that, the way to compose a text (adding recipients) is annoying, in my opinion. Definitely not very intuitive. To this day, using the HTC was a breeze in comparison to either of these models - you're likely better off with an app. The side scrolling... much preferred in S3, than S6, but that is me. I know everyone is different.Those are my gripes, essentially. Aside from that, it's definitely quicker, I love the feature of lightning charging, opening and cruising through apps is a breeze, transferring apps from the S3 to the S6 was a breeze. Maybe I need more time to get used to it...","May 31, 2017"
"Samsung Galaxy S6, Black Sapphire 32GB (AT&T)",BearCub,2.0,"update* I bought this phone a little over a year ago. The back of the phone broke a few months after I bought it. That wasn't too big of a deal since I had a cheap case on it and figured one of my dogs hit it when jumping up on me, but it was a bit frustrating since the back can't be removed and replaced. Then within the past few months I've been having non stop issues. First the speaker quit working, then the port to the ear phones, and now it's shutting off multiple times a day saying there's no charge with limited use. It's a little ridiculous that a product this expensive can't even last a year without needing to be replaced.I'm so happy to have a Samsung again. I bought the LG V10 because it was one of the few phones that had a removable battery and SD card, but had multiple issues with it.  My LG died on Thanksgiving and since my cell is my home phone, computer, e-reader and alarm clock I knew I was going to have to replace it quickly but didn't really have an extra $800 lying around to buy a new one from my carrier. I've had the Samsung Galaxy S6 for a few days now.  I chose the new option even though I had to pay more since the one and only time I bought refurbished the phone had some kind of software issue within 6 months and couldn't be fixed. It came in the original packaging with the original charger. It had about 50% battery life when I turned it on. I made sure to buy the one for my carrier so I was able to pop in my sim card and go. It was easy to set up though I did have some trouble with the my email syncing. I don't like that you have to have a ""special key"" (basically a thin metal stick) to open the drawer for the sim card, but that's just because I know I'm going to lose it.  I haven't taken many pictures, but the quality seems good. The battery life is great if you're not using the phone. It burns through the battery pretty quickly if you're on it for an extended period of time. It's a little surprising since this is smaller than my last two galaxies but seems to go through the battery faster.  I haven't played a game on it yet, but I think it'll have a problem playing games for long periods of time. It got a little over heated when I was charging it and trying to do all the initial set up at the same time. It charges quickly though.  I have had to update it two days in a row, but I think that may just be because it's an older model. It shipped fast and showed up a day early. Overall very happy with the phone.","November 29, 2017"
"Samsung Galaxy S6, Black Sapphire 32GB (AT&T)",Vader D,4.0,"Good phone, be warned though if you by any phone newer then 2 years 1 month.  Most are still under contract, with the original owners.  Why and how simple ANY phone new then 2 years old is probably a phone some one dropped and had a cracked screen, mic or speaker stopped working, screen started acting funny, or any number of typical random problems.  Then the original owner of the phone calls AT&T, Sprint, Verizon, ect, and says ""Hay my phone broke can I have a new one.""  Service provider says sure and takes the phone then take the broken phone along with many others, and either fixes them or sells them to someone to fix, then either the provider or the phone repair company sells them to a re-seller.  So if you go trying to get the phone unlocked like I did, you will find that technically your phone is still property of the provider and you will have to ether go with them or go with a bring your own phone plan like Tracfone, or some other company.  But ether way you will not be able to unlock the phone as long as it is still listed under the original owners plan.  So from the providers point of view you have a stolen phone.","April 6, 2017"
"Samsung Galaxy S6, Black Sapphire 32GB (AT&T)",NinthAtPine,4.0,"A very nice phone. I have had primarily android devices and this one live up to what I expect from androids.Overall a very nice phone, worked quickly when adding in my Verizon carrier card. It uses the nano (smallest)  sim, so be sure to have that or you will need to get one from your carrier (usually free, but takes extra time if you don't have it).The phone works nicely with my wifi, although it does not always grab the strongest signal. I have a wifi extender in the house, and sometimes the phone will remain connected to the one with less signal strength, and I must change it manually.A few cons - but all around great phone.Pros - - Nice camera, nice pictures- good reception - quick processor- Charges quickly when plugged into the wall (a little slower when using USB)- Clean look (similar look to an iphone)Cons- Camera sometimes has issues in low light focusing- Battery seems to run out quickly (they do offer cases with charger built in) I typically will hook up to my computer during the day or plug it in when in the car to keep the charge up","October 24, 2016"
"Samsung Galaxy S6, Black Sapphire 32GB (AT&T)",Ahzanti,3.0,"This is my first refurbished unit with mixed results. First the good news: the unit frankly looked new and it was in excellent shape. Not sure I like the glossy slickness of the S6 as it wants to slide all the time. (I have just ordered a thin Body Glove to compensate). This unit has the expanded memory I wanted as I use my phone for Kindle, music, etc. and I didn't want to run out of space or worry about it. I'm very happy about that. And, it was packaged for Verizon as promised and they were able to bring it on their network with minimal effort. So, overall that worked out fine.HOWEVER, the unit itself has its quirks. Like the touch pad stops working and won't respond to any touch on the entire screen. Given time this passes, or clicking into sleep and unclicking helps. But I do have this happen pretty regularly. And, on some calls, the other caller suddenly can't hear me anymore. I've found it works best to keep the phone in a horizontal position and not talk with it vertical (like holding against my ear the whole time). I now use my ear buds a lot to talk on all calls at least when I can plan for them. This seems to really help so I can leave the phone flat.I went ahead and kept the unit because the pro's outweigh the con's, and I can't find this 128GB new otherwise. So, mixed results, but generally in favor of the phone.","February 22, 2017"
"Samsung Galaxy S6, Black Sapphire 32GB (AT&T)",Reb Buckley,3.0,"There are many things to like about the S6. The screen is bright and sharp. The camera is very high quality (for a smartphone). The version I got (delivered with Verizon service) has some apps I'd call ""trash"", but nothing terrible. I got 64GB memory, and after one+ year, that seems fine for me, allowing storage of lots of pictures, and a few videos; 32GB would be cramped. Wireless charging is a blessing (and maybe a curse; see below).On the negative side, there's the battery. Battery life leaves something to be desired. If you're a heavy user, just hope that a charge lasts through a log day. Also hope that your battery doesn't flat out die, as mine did after a year and a few months (after the warranty, but before the exchange period). Changing a battery requires a professional, which means you're likely to be without your phone for a little while.Now about wireless charging...that may have been the cause, or a contributing factor, to my battery's demise. In other ways, I take very good care of my phone. It's never left in a hot car, has never gotten wet, and I've never dropped it. However, I had the habit of placing my phone on the wireless charging stand overnight. I even left it on the stand much of the day. At least with my charger, this caused the battery to warm up a bit. Some online articles indicate this can be a problem. My phone repairer is also wary of wireless charging. Obviously, I've stopped using that charger.","August 26, 2016"
"Samsung Galaxy S6, Black Sapphire 32GB (AT&T)",CarolB,4.0,"I love everything about this phone expect for two things: Its battery life and software. If you absolutely care about having a battery that will make it past a work day, and care about software that's smooth, responsive, and intuitive, get a Nexus 6P. In my use, I could barely squeeze 2 hours of screen time before the phone was on its last legs. That is simply not that good.There's nothing wrong with the software per se, but after a while performance starts to suffer in the form of stuttering, second delays when opening apps, and a general feeling that the phone isn't going as fast as it should. The rest of the phone is excellent. Its design is compact, easy to hold, and feels great in the hand. The screen and camera are among (if not THE) best, and even the single speaker pumps out loud audio. Also, the fingerprint reader, wireless charging, and fast charging all round out a rather complete package.However, if you care even a little about battery life and don't like the idea of searching for a charger after an 8-hour work day, and also don't like it when phone's start lagging even for just a second or two, get a Nexus 6P.","December 1, 2015"
"Samsung Galaxy S6, Black Sapphire 32GB (AT&T)",Larry,4.0,"This phone is a great value at around $140 to $180The screen is fantastic. Thanks to it's OLED technology the blacks are very deep and the colors are very vivid. Brightness is great for indoor and outdoor use. Stands very well next to current flagship devices.The battery life is not so grand. At 2,550 mAh. this device will need to be dropped on a charger mid-way through the day if you use your device moderately through the day.The camera quality is close to that of an entry level DSLR. With its 16mp sensor and feature packed camera app, this device's camera easily challenges most entry level DSLR. The colors are very accurate and the device has very respectable dynamic range. Low light situations are not an issue either, pictures in dark situations come out with minimal noise and decent color reproduction.The design is very premium and holds very well to today's flag ship devices.Overall it is a great device that I think most people would find great as a daily driver.","October 24, 2017"
"Samsung Galaxy S6, Black Sapphire 32GB (AT&T)",Mr. Peanutbutter,3.0,"This is my fourth Samsung phone. This year, I experimented with AT&T prepaid, which offered me a free refurbished ZTE...the prepaid option itself has saved us hundreds of dollars, but the ZTE is absolute garbage. Slow, terrible photos, and it couldn't read my SD card. I was desperate to get back to a Samsung, but I'm on a very tight budget, so the  S9 is simply not an option. All I had to do was insert my SIM and it worked perfectly. I really missed Samsung, and I don't need all the fancy features of some of the newer models. I use my phone to track down the bus, listen to music, and keep track of emails. With Samsung, you don't need the latest and greatest to do the basics efficiently. Within half an hour of turning this on, I downloaded about 6 GB worth of music and apps, ran updates, all at the speed you can expect from Samsung. I purchased this specifically from Amazon Warehouse because they've always got great deals.Now, I completely overlooked the fact that THIS is the model that Samsung chose to forego the Micro SD card. I was really disappointed and considered returning the phone, but I'll keep it. I've gotten used to streaming music anyhow, so I'm not downloaded my entire music library onto here.","December 13, 2018"
"Samsung Galaxy S6, Black Sapphire 32GB (AT&T)",JD91,4.0,"Bought this phone for my wife, since we are now month-to-month with Verizon, and I saw no need to drop a pile of cash or enter monthly enslavement to their lease contract (sorry, I forgot, it's not a ""contract"" anymore).It worked out of the box with her Sim card. it's been several months, and she's very happy with it, and I'm really impressed with the pictures and general performance of the phone.It's in good condition, not immediately obvious that it was used or reconditioned.The charger supplied was obviously a cheap knock-off, but it works, and we go through chargers fairly often anyway (kids help themselves and then lose them). I think the earbuds it came with were also knock-offs, but I don't remember. Whatever they were, they weren't worth keeping.Overall, the seller did a good job with it.

"Samsung Galaxy S6, Black Sapphire 32GB (AT&T)",R1,5.0,"I just received my White S6 128gb on Saturday & so far I have enjoy using it. I'm not totally loving the battery life because it really doesn't last very long. I had a HTC M8 before & with power saving on,  I was able to get at least 12 hrs of normal use (like surfing on social medias, texting, checking email,  YouTube). With the S6 with the same settings, if lucky,  I get 12 hrs with light use (barely using my phone except when I receive messages or phone calls).  We have a history of HTCs started to crap out on us after 2 years, so I decided trade in for the HTC, since I remember how much I loved the S3, for the S6. Plus my fiance loves his Note4, and wants me to get a Samsung. So far my pictures are way better than what I getting from my HTC, but I do miss my speakers; it is something to get use to. I really hope this phone will last me for a long time by I'm planning  to use it 2+ years, & I hope Samsung creates a bigger battery for the S6, I'll will definitely love my phone then.","October 19, 2015"

It is definitely an upgrade from my HTC One 8, as it performs much better on apps like Snapchat, Facebook, etc. and takes really beautiful pictures! (That is one of my fav. parts). I also think it looks nice and I love the large screen. The one downside I have found is that it doesn't hold battery for crap. I have to recharge at least twice per day. It also is really picky when it comes to chargers....the generic ones from gas stations literally will not work in this phone. If I can even get them to connect, it takes 6+ hours to charge.

Imagine my surprise when I got this phone and it looked brand new!  I walked over to the Verizon store (which is 2 blocks from my office) and they immediately activated it.  And the S6 is a much better phone than the S5 I replaced.  The battery life seems longer.  I don't get the constant emails to update my phone (which I seemed to get every other day on my S5!), and I just like this phone all around much better than my S5.

Looked at the S6 Edge, but since I put my phones in an Otterbox case, it would have been a waste. After over six months, I am very happy with it.  I love just sitting in on the fast charger and having it ready to go in less than an hour. Nothing to plug-in. Waiting to see how the battery holds up, but so far, so good. It gets me though a day even with the bluetooth activity and connection to the Weather channel. I had a Droid Razr before . Also a great phone.  Lasted a long time.  I was reluctant to try another Samsung after the problems I had with an older model, but they seemed to have gotten things right.I will update if I have any problems with it.

"Samsung Galaxy S6, Black Sapphire 32GB (AT&T)",Kay Decker,5.0,"I upgraded from the Samsung Galaxy S4.  These are the things I like better about the S6:  Brighter display.  Two part volume button makes it easier to adjust the volume.  Being able to close apps by touching the icon to the left of the home button instead of having to hold down the home button.  Using the flashlight on the quick settings panel rather than needing a separate app. Being able to scroll down the settings panel rather than having to choose from the different types of settings in advance. Even though the screen is slightly bigger the overall size of the phone feels smaller..  I use an Otter Box Defender Series case, as I did with the S4, and it definitely is less bulky than before. I have an armband for the phone. I can put the entire case in the armband with the S6 whereas with the S4 I needed to remove the outer layer of the case.

I have had the S2 / S4 in the past. The touchwiz overlay for Android is not too bad. The KidZone feature is kind of nice to make sure your kids don't destroy your phone. The S6 is just about the same size of the S4, so if you don't want a phone as large as your head, this is good. The phone does look nice.......Cons: Which means you cannot add a microSD card. This is my biggest gripe on the S6 (which the S7 corrects when it falls Q2'16). If this phone support the microSD card I would have gotten 2 of them. No access to the battery does not affect me at all.If you can wait for sometime, you might want to wait for the S7 to come out to get the microSD slot option to be added back.","December 17, 2015"

I was shocked to pick the phone up and find a nickel-sized smash zone in the lower left corner of the back of the case. I was able to seal it up with epoxy resin, and once the Otterbox was on, the damage wasn't visible anyway, so no big deal, right? UNTIL...about a week later, with the Otterbox now on, I dropped the phone into a pan with a couple of inches of cold water in it. Only the top third of the phone was ever submerged, but I dried it in rice for 24 hours anyway. The thing hasn't worked properly since. All kinds if issues with connectivity, voice-to-text, touch screen response, etc. The bottom line is, I had to replace the phone (got an s7 this time) after less than two weeks of ownership, as a result of what I consider to be very minor abuse that every phone I've ever owned previously would have easily withstood. It's a nice device in a lot of ways, I guess, but it's as fragile as an egg. I would never buy another s6, nor would I recommend it to others.","January 2, 2018"

Today, I was using it as usual and when I clicked the home button to turn the screen on to look at the time, it stayed black. I pressed the side button and it didn't turn on. It was really weird. I tried charging it though it was already fully charged and nothing. No response, no sense of life, nothing. I can't get it to turn on. Idk what happened, I was using it normally one second and then the next this blackout happened. I've never had problems with it before this random nonsense happened. I'm pretty bummed out because this phone was a good $330 and now there's nothing I can do.","April 28, 2016"
"Samsung Galaxy S6, Black Sapphire 32GB (AT&T)",deanna,3.0,"My S4 was my favorite phone of all time.  When my contract was up, the S6 just came out, so how could I pass on what could only be 2x better than my S4.  I was pretty disappointed.  Sure, it has more fancy gadgets, and it is quicker.  But it also comes with so much less, the number one issue being battery life.  I have never made it through a full day on one charge.  And I am not talking about watching youtube all day, it could be just sitting on my desk, and if I haven't plugged it in, it will be dead by 7:00.  As much as we depend on our phones these days, this is really unacceptable.  Hopefully the S8 will be 4x better than my S4.","July 8, 2016"

Great phone, quick at opening emails & such, the screen can be seen out side in the sun light.  This phone is like taking a small computer around with you all the time.  I do wish the sound was louder, even with the ring tone set at high level I still don't hear it all the time unless I am close by. I would for sure buy this product again!!!","August 4, 2016"

Front Camera takes AMAZINGLY CLEAR selfies, not a fan of the keyboard being set up similar to an iPhone on a Galaxy phone. It's a lot smaller than my Note 4 which I have to get use to again, bout the same size as the S5 but I believe it is thinner, glad the rear camera is 16MP still. The S6 also takes wide Selfies like my Note 4 which can be good, oh and the S6 has no removable battery and doesn't take a Micro SD card like an iPhone too, battery life on the S6 SUCKS which is a known issue that both AT&T and Verizon have told me.

I had to bring it to a Verizon store to have someone actually work on it to disable the app and return the phone to its original condition.

I start my day at 5:30 am and the phone is at 15% charge by 7:30 am with minimal use. I gave 3 stars on picture quality because of the battery. I cant use the phone therefore I cant use the picture.

Seems to try hard at opening my recents but they don't stay open until my 4th or 5th attempt.My only real knock I have is the battery. Horrendous from the start. I'm a fairly heavy user and even with power saving mode on it gets me 8 hours maximum.

Extremely easy to reply to txt msgs without opening the messaging app.  Using TING cell phone service. The fingerprint scanner takes no time to access the phone & secure.

By 8 it's less than 50% battery life. That's with just basic texting, and occasional web surfing. I purchased a new battery months ago and had it put in because I thought the original battery was bad.  Nope! Battery life just sucks. I bought a powerbear battery case that helps. But it's so bulky. DO NOT BUY A S6. I've had every version of the galaxy S series. This is by far the worst battery life.I got this phone in 2 days, super fast shipping. Phone physically is flawless, smooth working, but the batter i think is going out. I charged the phone to 100% and then started texting and normal Facebook scrolling and light things. Within 5 minutes the battery was down  to under 80% . so a 20% drop in battery drainage in 5 minutes is extremely terrible. And what sucks worse is that the battery is built in.","February 24, 2017"

I don't think the upgrade to the S5 would have been worth it.  My two gripes with this new phone is that it was a bad decision to change the design so you cannot replace the battery yourself or expand the memory.

He decided to replace the battery, which wasn't an easy task, and the battery in the phone has a sticker on it saying refurbished.  My phone doesn't download the system update and I am going to have to go to a store and see if they can get it work.

I was really impressed with my last model the Samsung Galaxy S5 but this absolutely blows even that one away. The phone is fast and its a work horse. I could not get an Sd card so I went with the !@* GB. By the time it gets its upgrades to Marshmallow it loses 21 GB of memory leaving you with a very comfortable 107 gb of memory for your own use. It has a sleek comfortable feel in your hand. I have big fingers and can type very comfortably on this phone with out the aid of a stylus. The graphics are wonderful and the hd quality is the very best. I a very happy with this purchase. You do not have to be tech savvy to use this phone. I would recommend it to any one and my wife is also going to upgrade to this model. update  4/23/17 my return window closed on march 25 and now the phone is over heating to the point it feels as though it may explode so a nice phone rendered useless and not worth my time or money!!!! guess I'll be getting a new phone but be advised this phone didn't make it pat 90 days!!!,"February 27, 2017"
"Samsung Galaxy S6, Black Sapphire 32GB (AT&T)",Jerome,1.0,"I bought this in March and by August I was having battery issues - charge disappearing faster and faster until it would completely shut off (even with 100% battery charge) if I tried to use it without it being plugged in to a charger.  Not much of a ""mobile"" phone if it only works while tethered... So, I bought a replacement battery on Amazon only to find out it's like Fort Knox just to get the phone open!  According to online, apparently you have to ""heat up phone"" then ""remove shell with a suction cup"" to get to the battery - WHAT?!? So, we did that to remove the back - turns out still can't get to the battery that way.  So, went to do same to the front, which ended up causing fatal damage to my screen.  Technicolor party now flashing from the opening attempt location and it won't open up to my home screen. GREAT.  THANKS SO MUCH.  And, like others have mentioned, even before all this happened, the phone would get really hot in my hands while using for more than 5 minutes at a time.

"Samsung Galaxy S6, Black Sapphire 32GB (AT&T)",J9 aka Mom,1.0,"Bought this phone used to hold me over about 4 weeks until my new phone arrives. This phone has terrible input lag in general. 90% of the time you tap something on the screen, it will take a few seconds to register. When I am texting, there are times where I can type 3-4 words before it shows up on screen. Majority of the time it's at least 1 word delay. Apps will take forever to load, or not respond. I've tried upgrading and downgrading firmware  with same results. Battery life is horrible, phone sitting idle over night lost 64%. Should've taken that into consideration since this phone has a non-replaceable battery.  If you are going to buy a used phone, I personally would buy a phone with a replaceable battery, and buy a new battery along with it next time. This phone also gets very hot while doing very little. I tried closing all open apps, and have only the internet browser open, and just browsing alone, the phone can get hot enough where you dont want to hold it. That was fixed by getting a phone case, but you can still feel the warmth through it.

For instance, if you have three sceens you go 1,2,3 and then you have to go back 3,2,1 in order to get back to the first screen. Whereas the S4 you could go 1,2,3,1,2,3. That's the only thing I've found disappointing so far, so pretty good overall! The speed is always top notch when you first get the phone.

"Samsung Galaxy S6, Black Sapphire 32GB (AT&T)",Mattressburn,2.0,I have had an S6 for years. when our unit became non repairable I ordered this Rebuilt one. The price was right and it had all the features we had come to love. Except that it worked only one day. Unit kept shutting down. sometimes it would need a Hard restart to get it to come on. ( hold power button and volume Button at the same time) I worked with the Samsung tech support and they remotely went thru the phone did a factory reset and down loaded all the updates. At that point the same updates kept trying to reload every hour or so. and it kept shutting down more often. Not happy with the rebuilt Samsung. Loved my old brand new one.,"August 1, 2018"

The charge port on my phone works worse than my S5 that is nearly 3 years old now. I have to hold the wire at the perfect angle for it to charge. Next is the fact that with the charger they provided it takes nearly 7 hours to charge the phone. I don't have that long to wait and be tied to a charger.

I contact Samsung they said take it to a warranty center, which I did. The service guy checked it out and said, hardware side, everything checks out.

She handled the phone diligently and only opened it when she needed full screen( she has the galaxy watch paired with it) and the screen still cracked at the fold.No problem I thought, I have this covered under my cellular provider insurance.  Welp not quite.  AT&T will not replace the device as long as its within the one year of the manufacturers warranty. For weeks I got the run around as I was redirected from AT&T to Bestbuy from them to a smaller authorized repair shop.  The repair shop said it's a 50/50 chance that Samsung will pay them to replace it.  They gave me some US representative number to call and send the phone back to Samsung for replacement.Still haven't heard back Samsung.

Put up with it and used it for months in it's new slightly-bent state.  Eventually the screen protector needed replacing but removing the screen protector caused the bottom left 25% of the screen to go dark.

Now after 4 months we apparently can't return it.  The screen has a crease in the middle that makes it hard to see anything.  It won't open all the way because there is apparently dust stuck in the hinge that you can't get to.  Now you can't even select anything on the screen most of the time.  it overheats in an air conditioned room.  It doesn't receive calls or messages until hours after they are sent.

Thirdly, the phone/battery is constantly warm, to the point where I have to put it down for fear of overheating. That's troubling because, again, I have not been using it for long periods of time. I don't use it for gaming, heavy media use, or anything of the sort.I've always been satisfied with my Samsung Galaxy S purchases, but unfortunately not this time. I can't rely on this phone. I suspect it may not even be new, despite the product description saying otherwise. I've tried contacting the seller a number of times from April until now, but have heard nothing back.","June 1, 2024"

Samsung Galaxy J3 (Verizon LTE Prepaid),R. L.,4.0,"This is a prepaid phone, but I was able to activate it on my Verizon unlimited account by first activting in on the cheapest ""prepaid"" plan for about $30, and then having Verizon customer service migrate it onto my existing account using the phone number I already use.  It was a little complicated for them to accomplish (took about 1/2 hour on the phone), but it saved me about $100, so it was worth it.The phone itself is perfect for my needs.  It doesn't have alot of internal memory, but I just stuck a micro SD card in it and stored my contacts and various aps on it.  It doesn't come pre-loaded with lots of junk aps, which is a huge plus!The internet works fast, but the media volume leaves a bit to be desired. The phone sound clarity is good, and I get good reception in my house (which was a problem with my ancient S4, and why I bought a new phone).Interestingly, it didn't come with a voicemail ap.  I downloaded one from the PlayStore, and now I'm a happy camper in that department.I have read that the camera clarity is not good.  That may be true if you are using this as your primary camers.  For my purposes it seems to be just fine.All-in-all, if you are not a smartphone power user, this phone is perfectly adequate.  I recommend it!","February 21, 2017"

However, I will say that I don't download much and only have about 3 apps that didn't come with this phone (banking, Word, and FB Messenger). I store all my videos & photos in my Google Cloud and erase from phone's memory constantly. I still encounter issues where my phone doesn't have enough memory - like yesterday when Samsung said it had an update for my phone. I had to go to my phone's storage & erase cached data in order to get just barely enough RAM to download the update. Nothing I have on my phone can go on an SD card, so that is not the issue. The internal memory is just not enough after all the factory settings take up 85% of the phone's storage.","March 4, 2017"

Samsung Galaxy J3 (Verizon LTE Prepaid),elizabeth r Robertson,3.0,"Why Samsung would use the name ""Galaxy"", which represents its flagship phone, to a low-end phone like this is beyond my comprehension.  I briefly had a used Galaxy S4 before this phone, and even though it was 3 years old, it had better features and specs than this brand new (2016) Galaxy J3.  The J3 has a mediocre processor (1.2 Ghz) and a camera that by today's standards is low resolution (5 MP).  What's worse is that for some reason, Verizon chose to only make this phone available with 8 GB of internal memory, when the same phone on carriers like Boost and Virgin Mobile comes with 16 GB.  I had the exact same specs last year on my ZTE Overture 2 phone from Cricket Wireless that only cost me $50 (and is less than that now).Other disappointments with this phone are that there is NO notification light on the front of the phone when you get new text messages or voicemails.  The only visible way you'll know that you've received a text or voicemail is by looking at the home screen (you can get the phone to beep or vibrate for notifications).  Similarly, when the phone is charging, there is no indicator light on the face to tell you when charging is complete; again, you'll have to look on the lock screen or home screen for a message that says the phone is fully charged.  When sending a text, there is no way to speak the words that you want to text rather than typing them, which can be very frustrating at times.  If you use Verizon's own messaging app on the phone, you can speak and attach an audio file of your voice to your message, but there is no voice to text functionality.On the plus side, the battery life seems decent so far.  I've used the phone for navigation with Google maps and Waze for 3 hours or more and did not need to recharge the phone.  You get the most recent version of the Android OS on this phone (Marshmallow), which is not yet available on some phones that cost much more than this one.  The best reason to choose this particular phone, though, is that it runs on the reliable Verizon network.  For $45/month (plus tax and your local 911 fee) you'll have access to unlimited nationwide calling, texts and 2 GB of data on Verizon's network.  Sign up for auto pay, and you'll get an extra 1 GB of data every month, for a total of 3 GB data monthly.","July 1, 2016"

Samsung Galaxy J3 (Verizon LTE Prepaid),MoJones85,5.0,"When my 2nd Galaxy Note 7 was recalled I had 3 choices: (1) reactivate my crappy 4 year old phone, (2) pay $700+ for last year's Samsung Flagship Galaxy 7 Edge (3) get a new, inexpensive phone to hold me over until the Galaxy 8's are released.Since I am a die hard Samsung Loyalist, I went for the Galaxy J3.  It was cheap compared to the flagship phones - $175.I am pleasantly surprised; I like this little phone.Setting It UpVery simple.  I used the Samsung App called Smart Switch to clone my Note 7.  The app downloaded all my pics, ringtones, settings, contacts and apps, even most passwords.  The entire process took about 30 minutes.Pros:- Cheap- Same interface as the Galaxy 7; same apps; very similar user experience- Removable battery- Accepts an external memory chip- Small, light weight- Long lasting battery- Cases and screen protectors are cheap- Wont explode or catch on fire- J3 is so inexpensive that I skipped insurance- It can do 95% of what a Galaxy 7 can do- Did I mention cheap? You can buy 3 of these for the price of a flagshipCons:- Smaller than a flagship phone- Camera is a little bit slower- Friends not impressed (like I care)- Doesn't have the high definition screen optics of a flagship- No fingerprint scanner, no Samsung payBottom Line: Great phone; can do 95% of the things an $800 phone can do.PS: I paid full price for this phone; nobody gave me anything as an incentive to write this review.","October 19, 2016"
Samsung Galaxy J3 (Verizon LTE Prepaid),Brenda,4.0,"It's a lower-end phone, so you can expect some cuts in places.  The camera leaves a lot to be desired, so Instagrammers and Snapchatters....consider.  The 8GB internal memory sucks - and makes no sense for any smartphone in existence.  I added a 32GB SD card to offset this issue, which has helped, but the problem shows up with the ""stock apps"" and non-transferable apps (like a bank app) that periodically update.  So eventually, depending on what types of apps you download, you could run out of workable internal memory space no matter how much you transfer to the SD card.  However, it has the typical Samsung perks, plus it plays my music, it switches to Bluetooth seamlessly, its LED screen is a plus; the phone is tough, the battery is solid, and the operating system is outstanding.","July 23, 2016"

Samsung Galaxy J3 (Verizon LTE Prepaid),Steve,2.0,"This phone is beautiful and mostly functional, but I've had an issue with using a hands free device while traveling in my car (tried 3 different ones same problem with all). There is terrible noise on the end of the listener. I took it to Verizon and they said the microphone on the phone is not shutting off when you're using the microphone on the hands free device. SO thinking it might be a lemon I went in and got another J3. Same problem. Now they are both going back. I also found the camera to be pretty crappy. Can't even get the colors right. If neither of those things are important to you, you'll probably get a long great.","August 18, 2016"
Samsung Galaxy J3 (Verizon LTE Prepaid),kelly arlene cora,4.0,"I love the phone because it's fast, responsive and it does what I need it to do. I love the features it has. The two things I dislike is when my SD card is being used, like installing apps or copying music, my phone will restart, but I'm assuming it's a bad SD card. Also I'm used to auto-brightness in different lighting areas, and this phone does not have auto brightness as it don't have the sensor that allows that function. Overall great phone.","July 20, 2016"
Samsung Galaxy J3 (Verizon LTE Prepaid),Owyhee gal,2.0,"I got this on a Black Friday sale elsewhere. I bumped it off the bedside table. It landed on padded carpeting and stopped working. It was nice for two months!  I had been using a flip phone, only wanted this to be able to look up stuff for price/re views when shopping. I went back to my more rugged Samsung flip phone. It was to late to return, and at $24, I had not bothered with insurance.","March 11, 2018"
Samsung Galaxy J3 (Verizon LTE Prepaid),Leo Maneke,4.0,"I got this phone brand new a few months ago on sale at my local Best Buy. This phone is sleek and looks great, feels well made. It has great functionality, is snappy and comes with the latest Android software...i can say it is much faster than my old out-dated smartphone. The camera is okay, but not great as it's only 5mp so don't expect iphone quality shots. I originally used my J3 on Verizon's prepaid plan but have switched over to Straight Talk, and my data speed really hasn't changed plus I'm still on Verizon's network so I am getting the best deal, in my opinion. Overall, I love this phone, and I got a stellar deal on it! The only real problem is the lack of storage...it comes pre-installed with some bogus apps that take up most of the limited storage space. So you really must pick up an additional memory card or you'll only be able to download 3 or so additinal apps, depending on the amount of photos and/or music you have on your phone.","September 28, 2016"
Samsung Galaxy J3 (Verizon LTE Prepaid),nearoffutt,1.0,"Owned this phone for over half a year now or so. Memory is always an issue just like everyone noticed. But here's a kicker. Just today it stopped charging while showing that it's ""charging"" on the battery indicator. And nothing you can do but watch as the life runs out of it. If you ever notice your phone not actually charging even though it says it is, prepare yourself. Cause now it won't even turn on. And it won't show a charging icon when it's off and plugged in.","October 22, 2016"
Samsung Galaxy J3 (Verizon LTE Prepaid),Sammi-Jo Skinner,5.0,"I have gone from an iPhone to a Samsung flip phone and now upgraded to a Samsung J3V using Verizon as my service provider.  Unlike a lot of smartphone users, I am not heavy on apps and I am not concerned about the camera.  As an amateur photographer, I already own 4 digital cameras.  I am a PC kind of of guy in a handheld world, which is fine with me.  All I wanted was a phone for calls, email and text messaging and one which will operate in Europe.  I got all that at a very reasonable price.  After adding an 8 Gb SD card, and an Otter box case, I was good to go.  If you dont need all the bells and whistles of a more expensive phone, then consider this one.","July 12, 2017"
